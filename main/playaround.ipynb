TEDTalk.\\n', 'He showed it to Javier.\\n', 'They called me.\\n', 'They said, \"Let\\'s present this to the leaders of our country.\"\\n', 'So in December we met in Miami,  in a hotel conference room.\\n', 'I tried to explain this point  about how valuable cities are,  how much more valuable they are than they cost.\\n', \"And I used this slide  showing how valuable the raw land is  in a place like New York City:  notice, land that's worth thousands of dollars, in some cases,  per square meter.\\n\", 'But it was a fairly abstract discussion,  and at some point when there was a pause,  Octavio said,  \"Paul, maybe we could watch the TEDTalk.\"\\n', 'So the TEDTalk laid out in very simple terms,  a charter city is a place  where you start with uninhabited land,  a charter that specifies the rules that will apply there  and then a chance for people to opt in,  to go live under those rules or not.\\n', 'So I was asked by the president of Honduras who said that we need to do this project,  this could be the way forward for our country.\\n', 'I was asked to come to Tegucigalpa  and talk again on January fourth and fifth.\\n', 'So I presented  another fact-filled lecture  that included a slide like this,  which tried to make the point that, if you want to create a lot of value in a city,  it has to be very big.\\n', 'This is a picture of Denver,  and the outline is the new airport that was built in Denver.\\n', 'This airport alone  covers more than 100 square kilometers.\\n', \"if you build a new city,  you've got to start with a site that's at least 1,000 square kilometers.\\n\", \"That's more than 250 hundred-thousand acres.\\n\", 'Everybody applauded politely.\\n', 'The faces in the audience  were very serious and attentive.\\n', 'The leader of the congress came up on stage and said,  \"Professor Romer, thank you very much for your lecture,  but maybe we could watch the TEDTalk.\\n', 'I\\'ve got it here on my laptop.\"\\n', 'So I sat down, and they played the TEDTalk.\\n', 'And it got to the essence,  which is that a new city could offer new choices for people.\\n', 'There would be a choice of a city which you could go to  instead of hundreds of miles away in the North.\\n', 'And it also involved new choices for leaders.\\n', 'Because the leaders in the government there in Honduras  would need help from partner countries,  who could benefit from partner countries  who help them set up the rules in this charter and the enforcement, so everybody can trust  that the charter really will be enforced.\\n', 'And the insight of President Lobo  was that that assurance of enforcement  that I was thinking about  as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the city  could be equally important for all the different parties in Honduras  who had suffered for so many years  from fear and distrust.\\n', 'We went and looked at a site.\\n', \"This picture's from there.\\n\", 'It easily could hold a thousand square kilometers.\\n', 'And shortly thereafter, on January 19th,  they voted in the congress to amend their constitution  to have a constitutional provision  that allows for special development regions.\\n', 'In a country which had just gone through this wrenching crisis,  the vote in the congress in favor of this constitutional amendment  was 124 to one.\\n', 'All parties, all factions in society, backed this.\\n', 'To be part of the constitution, you actually have to pass it twice in the congress.\\n', 'On February 17th they passed it again  with another vote of 114 to one.\\n', 'Immediately after that vote,  on February 21st to the 24th,  a delegation of about 30 Hondurans  that are most interested in getting into the city building business.\\n', 'One is South Korea.\\n', \"This is a picture of a big, new city center  that's being built in South Korea --  bigger than downtown Boston.\\n\", 'Everything you see there was built in four years,  after they spent four years getting the permits.\\n', \"The other place that's very interested in city building is Singapore.\\n\", \"They've actually built two cities already in China  and are preparing the third.\\n\", \"So if you think about this practically,  here's where we are.\\n\", \"They've got a site; they're already thinking about this site for the second city.\\n\", \"They're putting in place a legal system  that could allow for managers to come in,  and also an external legal system.\\n\", 'One country has already volunteered to let its supreme court  be the court of final appeal for the new judicial system there.\\n', \"There's designers and builders of cities  who are very interested.\\n\", 'They even can bring with them some financing.\\n', \"But the one thing you know they've already solved  is that there's lots of tenants.\\n\", \"There's lots of businesses that would like to locate in the Americas, especially in a place with a free trade zone,  and there's lots of people who'd like to go there.\\n\", \"Around the world, there's 700 million people  who say they'd like to move permanently someplace else right now.\\n\", \"There's a million a year  who leave Latin America to go to the United States.\\n\", 'Many of these are a father  who has to leave his family behind to go get a job --  who has to get enough money to even pay for food or clothing.\\n', \"Sadly, sometimes there are even children  who are trying to get reunited with their parents  that they haven't seen, in some cases, for a decade.\\n\", 'So what kind of an idea is it  to think about building a brand new city in Honduras?\\n', 'Or to build a dozen of these,  or a hundred of these, around the world?\\n', 'What kind of an idea is it  to think about insisting  that every family have a choice of several cities  that are competing to attract new residents?\\n', 'This is an idea worth spreading.\\n', '', 'I want you to imagine two couples  in the middle of 1979  on the exact same day, at the exact same moment,  each conceiving a baby -- okay?\\n', 'So two couples each conceiving one baby.\\n', \"Now I don't want you to spend too much time imagining the conception,  because if you spend all that time imagining that conception,  you're not going to listen to me.\\n\", 'So just imagine that for a moment.\\n', 'And in this scenario,  the sperm is carrying a Y chromosome,  meeting that X chromosome of the egg.\\n', 'And in the other case,  the sperm is carrying an X chromosome,  meeting the X chromosome of the egg.\\n', 'Both are viable; both take off.\\n', \"We'll come back to these people later.\\n\", 'So I wear two hats  in most of what I do.\\n', 'As the one hat,  I do history of anatomy.\\n', \"I'm a historian by training,  and what I study in that case  is the way that people have dealt with anatomy --  meaning human bodies, animal bodies --  how they dealt with bodily fluids, concepts of bodies;  how have they thought about bodies.\\n\", 'is as an activist,  as a patient advocate --  or, as I sometimes say, as an impatient advocate --  for people who are patients of doctors.\\n', \"In that case, what I've worked with  is people who have body types  that challenge social norms.\\n\", \"So some of what I've worked on, for example,  is people who are conjoined twins --  two people within one body.\\n\", \"Some of what I've worked on is people who have dwarfism --  so people who are much shorter than typical.\\n\", \"And a lot of what I've worked on  is people who have atypical sex --  so people who don't have the standard male  or the standard female body types.\\n\", 'And as a general term, we can use the term intersex for this.\\n', 'Intersex comes in a lot of different forms.\\n', \"that isn't standard for male or female.\\n\", 'So in one instance,  you can have somebody who has an XY chromosomal basis,  and that SRY gene on the Y chromosome  tells the proto-gonads, which we all have in the fetal life,  to become testes.\\n', 'And so in the fetal life the testes are pumping out testosterone.\\n', \"But because this individual lacks receptors  to hear that testosterone,  the body doesn't react to the testosterone.\\n\", 'And this is a syndrome called androgen insensitivity syndrome.\\n', 'So lots of levels of testosterone, but no reaction to it.\\n', 'As a consequence, the body develops  more along the female typical path.\\n', 'When the child is born, she looks like a girl.\\n', 'She is a girl. She is raised as a girl.\\n', \"And it's often not until she hits puberty  and she's growing and developing breasts,  but she's not getting her period,  that somebody figures out something's up here.\\n\", 'And they do some tests and figure out  that, instead of having ovaries inside and a uterus,  she actually has testes inside, and she has a Y chromosome.\\n', \"Now what's important to understand  is you may think of this person as really being male,  but they're really not.\\n\", 'Females, like males,  have in our bodies something called the adrenal glands.\\n', \"They're in the back of our body.\\n\", 'And the adrenal glands make androgens,  which are a masculinizing hormone.\\n', \"Most females like me -- I believe myself to be a typical female --  I don't actually know my chromosomal make-up  but I think I'm probably typical --  most females like me are actually androgen-sensitive.\\n\", \"We're making androgen, and we're responding to androgens.\\n\", 'has actually had a brain exposed to more androgens  than the woman born with testes  who has androgen insensitivity syndrome.\\n', \"So sex is really complicated; it's not just that intersex people  in some ways, they can be all over the place.\\n\", 'Another example:  a few years ago I got a call from a man who was 19 years old,  who was born a boy, raised a boy,  had a girlfriend, had sex with his girlfriend,  had a life as a guy  and had just found out that he had ovaries and a uterus inside.\\n', 'What he had was an extreme form  of a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia.\\n', 'He had XX chromosomes,  and in the womb,  his adrenal glands were in such high gear  that it created, essentially, a masculine hormonal environment.\\n', 'And as a consequence, his genitals were masculinzed,  his brain was subject  to the more typical masculine component of hormones.\\n', 'And he was born looking like a boy -- nobody suspected anything.\\n', 'And it was only when he had reached the age of 19  that he began to have enough medical problems  actually from menstruating internally,  that doctors figured out that, in fact, he was female internally.\\n', 'Okay, so just one more quick example  of a way you can have intersex.\\n', 'Some people who have XX chromosomes  develop what are called ovotestis,  which is when you have ovarian tissue  with testicular tissue wrapped around it.\\n', \"And we're not exactly sure why that happens.\\n\", 'So sex can come in lots of different varieties.\\n', \"that children with these kinds of bodies --  whether it's dwarfism, or it's conjoined twinning,  or it's an intersex type --  are often normalized by surgeons  is not because it actually leaves them better off  in terms of physical health.\\n\", 'In many cases, people are actually perfectly healthy.\\n', \"The reason they're often subject to various kinds of surgeries  is because they threaten our social categories.\\n\", 'that a particular kind of anatomy comes with a particular identity.\\n', 'So we have the concept that what it means to be a woman  is to have a female identity;  what it means to be a black person is, allegedly,  is to have an African anatomy  in terms of your history.\\n', 'And so we have this terribly simplistic idea.\\n', \"And when we're faced with a body  that actually presents us something quite different,  it startles us in terms of those categorizations.\\n\", 'So we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture  about individualism.\\n', \"And our nation's really founded on a very romantic concept of individualism.\\n\", 'Well you can imagine how startling then it is  when you have children that are born  who are two people inside of one body.\\n', 'Where I ran into the most heat from this most recently  was last year the South African runner, Caster Semenya,  had her sex called into question at the International Games in Berlin.\\n', 'I had a lot of journalists calling me, asking me,  \"Which is the test they\\'re going to run  that will tell us whether or not  Caster Semenya is male or female?\"\\n', \"And I had to explain to the journalists there isn't such a test.\\n\", \"that sex is complicated enough  that we have to admit  nature doesn't draw the line for us between male and female,  or between male and intersex and female and intersex;  we actually draw that line on nature.\\n\", 'So what we have is a sort of situation  where the farther our science goes,  the more we have to admit to ourselves  that these categories  that we thought of as stable anatomical categories  that mapped very simply  are a lot more fuzzy than we thought.\\n', \"And it's not just in terms of sex.\\n\", \"It's also in terms of race,  which turns out to be vastly more complicated  than our terminology has allowed.\\n\", 'As we look, we get into all sorts of uncomfortable areas.\\n', 'We look, for example, about the fact  that we share at least 95 percent of our DNA  with chimpanzees.\\n', 'What are we to make of the fact  that we differ from them only really by a few nucleotides?\\n', \"And as we get farther and farther with our science,  we get more and more into a discomforted zone  where we have to acknowledge  that the simplistic categories we've had  are probably overly simplistic.\\n\", \"So we're seeing this  in all sorts of places in human life.\\n\", 'in our culture today, in the United States today,  is battles over the beginning of life and the end of life.\\n', 'We have difficult conversations  about at what point we decide a body becomes a human,  such that it has a different right than a fetal life.\\n', \"We have very difficult conversations nowadays --  about the question of when somebody's dead.\\n\", 'In the past, our ancestors never had to struggle so much  with this question of when somebody was dead.\\n', \"At most, they'd stick a feather on somebody's nose,  and if it twitched, they didn't bury them yet.\\n\", 'If it stopped twitching, you bury them.\\n', 'But today, we have a situation  where we want to take vital organs out of beings  and give them to other beings.\\n', \"And as a consequence,  we're stuck with having to struggle with this really difficult question  about who's dead,  and this leads us to a really difficult situation  where we don't have such simple categories as we've had before.\\n\", 'Now you might think that all this breaking-down of categories  would make somebody like me really happy.\\n', \"I'm a political progressive, I defend people with unusual bodies,  but I have to admit to you that it makes me nervous.\\n\", 'Understanding that these categories  are really much more unstable than we thought makes me tense.\\n', 'from the point of view of thinking about democracy.\\n', \"So in order to tell you about that tension,  I have to first admit to you that I'm a huge fan of the Founding Fathers.\\n\", 'I know they were racists, I know they were sexist,  but they were great.\\n', 'I mean, they were so brave and so bold  and so radical in what they did  that I find myself watching that cheesy musical \"1776\" every few years,  and it\\'s not because of the music, which is totally forgettable.\\n', \"It's because of what happened in 1776  with the Founding Fathers.\\n\", 'The Founding Fathers were, for my point of view,  the original anatomical activists,  and this is why.\\n', 'What they rejected was an anatomical concept  and replaced it with another one  that was radical and beautiful and held us for 200 years.\\n', 'So as you all recall,  what our Founding Fathers were rejecting was a concept of monarchy,  and the monarchy was basically based  on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.\\n', \"The monarchs of the old world  didn't have a concept of DNA,  but they did have a concept of birthright.\\n\", 'They had a concept of blue blood.\\n', 'They had the idea that the people who would be in political power  should be in political power  because of the blood being passed down  from grandfather to father to son and so forth.\\n', 'The Founding Fathers rejected that idea,  and they replaced it with a new anatomical concept,  and that concept  was all men are created equal.\\n', 'They leveled that playing field  and decided the anatomy that mattered  was the commonality of anatomy,  not the difference in anatomy,  and that was a really radical thing to do.\\n', 'because they were part of an Enlightenment system  where two things were growing up together.\\n', 'And that was democracy growing up,  but it was also science growing up at the same time.\\n', \"And it's really clear, if you look at the history of the Founding Fathers,  a lot of them were very interested in science,  and they were interested in a concept  of a naturalistic world.\\n\", 'They were moving away from supernatural explanations,  and they were rejecting things like a supernatural concept of power,  where it transmitted  because of a very vague concept of birthright.\\n', 'They were moving towards a naturalistic concept.\\n', \"And if you look, for example, in the Declaration of Independence,  they talk about nature and nature's God.\\n\", \"They don't talk about God and God's nature.\\n\", \"They're talking about the power of nature  to tell us who we are.\\n\", 'So as part of that,  they were coming to us with a concept  that was about anatomical commonality.\\n', 'the Civil Rights movement of the future.\\n', \"They didn't think of it that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.\\n\", 'So what happened years afterward?\\n', 'What happened was women, for example,  who wanted the right to vote,  took the Founding Fathers\\' concept  of anatomical commonality being more important  than anatomical difference  and said, \"The fact that we have a uterus and ovaries  to mean that we shouldn\\'t have the right to vote,  the right to full citizenship,  the right to own property, etc., etc.\"\\n', 'And women successfully argued that.\\n', 'Next came the successful Civil Rights movement,  talking about, \"Ain\\'t I a woman?\"\\n', 'on the marching lines of the Civil Rights movement  saying, \"I am a man.\"\\n', 'Again, people of color  appealing to a commonality of anatomy over a difference of anatomy,  again, successfully.\\n', 'We see the same thing with the disability rights movement.\\n', 'The problem is, of course,  that, as we begin to look at all that commonality,  we have to begin to question  why we maintain certain divisions.\\n', 'Now mind you, I want to maintain some divisions,  anatomically, in our culture.\\n', \"For example, I don't want  to give a fish the same rights as a human.\\n\", \"I don't want to say we give up entirely on anatomy.\\n\", \"I don't want to say five-year-olds  should be allowed to consent to sex or consent to marry.\\n\", 'So there are some anatomical divisions  that make sense to me and that I think we should retain.\\n', 'and why do we retain them and do they have meaning.\\n', \"So let's go back to those two beings  conceived at the beginning of this talk.\\n\", 'We have two beings, both conceived  in the middle of 1979 on the exact same day.\\n', \"Let's imagine one of them, Mary,  is born three months prematurely,  so she's born on June 1, 1980.\\n\", \"Henry, by contrast, is born at term,  so he's born on March 1, 1980.\\n\", 'Simply by virtue of the fact  that Mary was born prematurely three months,  she comes into all sorts of rights  three months earlier than Henry does --  the right to consent to sex,  the right to vote, the right to drink.\\n', \"Henry has to wait for all of that,  not because he's actually any different in age, biologically,  except in terms of when he was born.\\n\", 'We find other kinds of weirdness in terms of what their rights are.\\n', \"Henry, by virtue of being assumed to be male --  although I haven't told you that he's the XY one --  by virtue of being assumed to be male  is now liable to be drafted,  which Mary does not need to worry about.\\n\", 'Mary, meanwhile, cannot in all the states  have the same right that Henry has in all the states,  namely, the right to marry.\\n', 'Henry can marry in every state a woman,  but Mary can only marry today in a few states a woman.\\n', 'So we have these anatomical categories that persist  that are in many ways problematic and questionable.\\n', \"And the question to me becomes:  What do we do,  in looking at anatomy,  that a democracy that's been based on anatomy  might start falling apart?\\n\", \"I don't want to give up the science,  but at the same time it kind of feels sometimes  like the science is coming out from under us.\\n\", 'So where do we go?\\n', 'It seems like what happens in our culture  is a sort of pragmatic attitude:  \"Well, we have to draw the line somewhere,  so we will draw the line somewhere.\"\\n', 'But a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position.\\n', \"Texas has at one point decided  that what it means to marry a man  is to mean that you don't have a Y chromosome,  and what it means to marry a woman means you do have a Y chromosome.\\n\", \"Now in practice they don't actually test people for their chromosomes.\\n\", 'But this is also very bizarre,  because of the story I told you at the beginning  about androgen insensitivity syndrome.\\n', 'If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy,  Dr. Martin Luther King,  he offers us something of a solution in his \"I have a dream\" speech.\\n', 'He says we should judge people \"based not on the color of their skin,  moving beyond anatomy.\\n', 'And I want to say, \"Yeah, that sounds like a really good idea.\"\\n', 'But in practice, how do you do it?\\n', 'How do you judge people based on the content of character?\\n', \"I also want to point out  that I'm not sure that is how we should distribute rights in terms of humans,  because, I have to admit, that there are some golden retrievers I know  that are probably more deserving of social services  than some humans I know.\\n\", 'I also want to say there are probably also some yellow Labradors that I know  that are more capable of informed, intelligent, mature decisions  about sexual relations than some 40-year-olds that I know.\\n', 'So how do we operationalize  the question of content of character?\\n', 'It turns out to be really difficult.\\n', \"And part of me also wonders,  what if content of character  turns out to be something that's scannable in the future --  able to be seen with an fMRI?\\n\", 'Do we really want to go there?\\n', \"I'm not sure where we go.\\n\", 'What I do know is that it seems to be really important  to think about the idea of the United States being in the lead  of thinking about this issue of democracy.\\n', \"We've done a really good job struggling with democracy,  and I think we would do a good job in the future.\\n\", \"We don't have a situation that Iran has, for example,  where a man who's sexually attracted to other men  is liable to be murdered,  unless he's willing to submit to a sex change,  in which case he's allowed to live.\\n\", \"We don't have that kind of situation.\\n\", 'a surgeon I talked to a few years ago  who had brought over a set of conjoined twins  in order to separate them, partly to make a name for himself.\\n', 'But when I was on the phone with him,  asking why he was going to do this surgery --  this was a very high-risk surgery --  his answer was that, in this other nation,  these children were going to be treated very badly, and so he had to do this.\\n', 'My response to him was, \"Well, have you considered political asylum  instead of a separation surgery?\"\\n', 'The United States has offered tremendous possibility  for allowing people to be the way they are,  without having them have to be changed for the sake of the state.\\n', 'So I think we have to be in the lead.\\n', \"Well, just to close, I want to suggest to you  that I've been talking a lot about the fathers.\\n\", 'And I want to think about the possibilities  of what democracy might look like, or might have looked like,  if we had more involved the mothers.\\n', 'And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist,  and that is that I think that there may be  different kinds of insights  that can come from different kinds of anatomies,  particularly when we have people thinking in groups.\\n', \"Now for years, because I've been interested in intersex,  I've also been interested in sex difference research.\\n\", \"And one of the things that I've been really interested in  in terms of the way they think and operate in the world.\\n\", 'And what we know from cross-cultural studies  is that females, on average --  not everyone, but on average --  are more inclined to be very attentive  to complex social relations  and to taking care of people  who are basically vulnerable within the group.\\n', 'And so if we think about that,  we have an interesting situation on our hands.\\n', 'Years ago, when I was in graduate school,  one of my graduate advisers who knew I was interested in feminism --  I considered myself a feminist, as I still do --  asked a really strange question.\\n', 'He said, \"Tell me what\\'s feminine about feminism.\"\\n', 'And I thought, \"Well that\\'s the dumbest question I\\'ve ever heard.\\n', 'Feminism is all about undoing stereotypes about gender,  so there\\'s nothing feminine about feminism.\"\\n', 'But the more I thought about his question,  the more I thought there might be something feminine about feminism.\\n', 'That is to say, there might be something, on average, different about female brains from male brains  that makes us more attentive  to deeply complex social relationships  and more attentive to taking care of the vulnerable.\\n', \"So whereas the fathers were extremely attentive  to figuring out how to protect individuals from the state,  it's possible that if we injected more mothers  into this concept,  what we would have is more of a concept  of, not just how to protect,  but how to care for each other.\\n\", \"And maybe that's where we need to go in the future,  when we take democracy beyond anatomy,  is to think less about the individual body,  in terms of the identity,  and think more about those relationships.\\n\", \"So that as we the people try to create a more perfect union,  we're thinking about what we do for each other.\\n\", '', \"If I can leave you with one big idea today,  it's that the whole of the data in which we consume  is greater that the sum of the parts,  and instead of thinking about information overload,  we can use information so that patterns pop  and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible.\\n\", \"So what we're looking at right here is a typical mortality chart  organized by age.\\n\", \"This tool that I'm using here is a little experiment.\\n\", \"It's called Pivot, and with Pivot what I can do  is I can choose to filter in one particular cause of deaths -- say, accidents.\\n\", \"And, right away, I see there's a different pattern that emerges.\\n\", \"This is because, in the mid-area here,  people are at their most active,  and over here they're at their most frail.\\n\", 'We can step back out again  and then reorganize the data by cause of death,  seeing that circulatory diseases and cancer  are the usual suspects, but not for everyone.\\n', 'If we go ahead and we filter by age --  say 40 years or less --  we see that accidents are actually  the greatest cause that people have to be worried about.\\n', \"And if you drill into that, it's especially the case for men.\\n\", 'So you get the idea  that viewing information, viewing data in this way,  is a lot like swimming  in a living information info-graphic.\\n', 'And if we can do this for raw data,  why not do it for content as well?\\n', 'So what we have right here  is the cover of every single Sports Illustrated ever produced.\\n', \"It's all here; it's all on the web.\\n\", 'You can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk.\\n', 'With Pivot, you can drill into a decade.\\n', 'You can drill into a particular year.\\n', 'You can jump right into a specific issue.\\n', \"So I'm looking at this; I see the athletes  that have appeared in this issue, the sports.\\n\", \"I'm a Lance Armstrong fan, so I'll go ahead and I'll click on that,  which reveals, for me, all the issues  in which Lance Armstrong's been a part of.\\n\", 'Now, if I want to just kind of take a peek at these,  \"Well, what about taking a look at all of cycling?\"\\n', 'So I can step back, and expand on that.\\n', 'And I see Greg LeMond now.\\n', \"And so you get the idea that when you  navigate over information this way --  going narrower, broader,  backing in, backing out --  you're not searching, you're not browsing.\\n\", \"You're doing something that's actually a little bit different.\\n\", \"It's in between, and we think it changes  the way information can be used.\\n\", \"So I want to extrapolate on this idea a bit  with something that's a little bit crazy.\\n\", \"What we're done here is we've taken every single Wikipedia page  and we reduced it down to a little summary.\\n\", 'So the summary consists of just a little synopsis  and an icon to indicate the topical area that it comes from.\\n', \"I'm only showing the top 500  most popular Wikipedia pages right here.\\n\", 'But even in this limited view,  we can do a lot of things.\\n', 'Right away, we get a sense of what are the topical domains  that are most popular on Wikipedia.\\n', \"I'm going to go ahead and select government.\\n\", 'Now, having selected government,  I can now see that the Wikipedia categories  that most frequently correspond to that  are Time magazine People of the Year.\\n', 'So this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within any one Wikipedia page.\\n', \"It's only possible to see that insight  when you step back and look at all of them.\\n\", 'Looking at one of these particular summaries,  I can then drill into the concept of  Time magazine Person of the Year,  bringing up all of them.\\n', \"So looking at these people,  I can see that the majority come from government;  some have come from natural sciences;  some, fewer still, have come from business --  there's my boss --  and one has come from music.\\n\", 'And interestingly enough,  Bono is also a TED Prize winner.\\n', 'So we can go, jump, and take a look at all the TED Prize winners.\\n', \"So you see, we're navigating the web for the first time  as if it's actually a web, not from page-to-page,  but at a higher level of abstraction.\\n\", 'And so I want to show you one other thing  that may catch you a little bit by surprise.\\n', \"I'm just showing the New York Times website here.\\n\", \"So Pivot, this application --  I don't want to call it a browser; it's really not a browser,  but you can view web pages with it --  and we bring that

Good.\\n', 'This is me making the \"I\\'m Not Good At Life\" face.\\n', \"This is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood  in Berkeley, California, where I did my PhD  on why we're better in games than we are in real life.\\n\", 'And this is a problem that a lot of gamers have.\\n', 'We feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games.\\n', \"I don't mean just good as in successful, although that's part of it.\\n\", 'We do achieve more in game worlds.\\n', 'But I also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters --  inspired to collaborate and to cooperate.\\n', \"And when we're in game worlds,  I believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves --  the most likely to help at a moment's notice,  the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes,  to get up after failure and try again.\\n\", \"And in real life, when we face failure,  when we confront obstacles, we often don't feel that way.\\n\", 'We feel overcome, we feel overwhelmed,  we feel anxious, maybe depressed, frustrated or cynical.\\n', \"We never have those feelings when we're playing games,  they just don't exist in games.\\n\", \"So that's what I wanted to study when I was a graduate student.\\n\", \"What about games makes it impossible  to feel that we can't achieve everything?\\n\", 'How can we take those feelings from games  and apply them to real-world work?\\n', 'So I looked at games like World of Warcraft,  which is really the ideal collaborative problem-solving environment.\\n', 'And I started to notice a few things  that make epic wins so possible in online worlds.\\n', \"The first thing is whenever you show up in one of these online games,  especially in World of Warcraft,  there are lots and lots of different characters  who are willing to trust you with a world-saving mission, right away. But not just any mission,  it's a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game.\\n\", 'Right? So you can do it.\\n', \"They never give you a challenge you can't achieve.\\n\", \"But it is on the verge of what you're capable of, so you have to try hard.\\n\", \"But there's no unemployment in World of Warcraft; no sitting around,  wringing your hands --  there's always something specific and important to be done.\\n\", 'There are also tons of collaborators.\\n', 'Everywhere you go, hundreds of thousands of people  ready to work with you to achieve your epic mission.\\n', \"That's not something we have in real life that easily,  this sense that at our fingertips are tons of collaborators.\\n\", \"And there's this epic story, this inspiring story of why we're there,  and what we're doing,  and we get all this positive feedback.\\n\", 'You guys have heard of leveling up, +1 strength, +1 intelligence.\\n', \"We don't get that kind of constant feedback in real life.\\n\", \"When I get off this stage,  I'm not going to have +1 speaking, and +1 crazy idea,  +20 crazy idea.\\n\", \"I don't get that feedback in real life.\\n\", \"Now, the problem with collaborative online environments like World of Warcraft  is that it's so satisfying to be on the verge of an epic win all the time,  we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds.\\n\", \"It's just better than reality.\\n\", 'So, so far, collectively all the World of Warcraft gamers  have spent 5.93 million years  solving the virtual problems of Azeroth.\\n', \"Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing.\\n\", \"It might sound like it's a bad thing.\\n\", 'But to put that in context:  5.93 million years ago  was when our earliest primate human ancestors stood up.\\n', 'That was the first upright primate.\\n', \"So when we talk about how much time we're currently investing in playing games,  the only way it makes sense to even think about it  is to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution,  which is an extraordinary thing.\\n\", \"But it's also apt,  because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games,  we're actually changing what we are capable of as human beings.\\n\", \"We're evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species.\\n\", 'This is true. I believe this.\\n', 'So, consider this really interesting statistic;  it was recently published by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University:  The average young person today in a country with a strong gamer culture  will have spent 10,000 hours playing online games  by the age of 21.\\n', 'Now 10,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reasons.\\n', 'First of all, for children in the United States,  10,080 hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school,  from fifth grade to high school graduation,  if you have perfect attendance.\\n', \"So, we have an entire parallel track of education going on,  where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gamer  as they're learning about everything else in school.\\n\", 'Some of you have probably read Malcolm Gladwell\\'s new book \"Outliers,\"  so you would have heard of his theory of success,  the \"10,000 hours\" theory of success.\\n', \"It's based on this great cognitive-science research  that says if we can master 10,000 hours  of effortful study at anything by the age of 21,  we will be virtuosos at it.\\n\", 'We will be as good at whatever we do  as the greatest people in the world.\\n', \"And so, now what we're looking at  is an entire generation of young people who are virtuoso gamers.\\n\", 'So, the big question is,  \"What exactly are gamers getting so good at?\"\\n', 'Because if we could figure that out,  we would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands.\\n', 'This is how many people we now have in the world  who spend at least an hour a day playing online games.\\n', 'These are our virtuoso gamers,  500 million people who are extraordinarily good at something.\\n', \"And in the next decade,  we're going to have another billion gamers  who are extraordinarily good at whatever that is.\\n\", \"If you don't know it already, this is coming.\\n\", 'The game industry is developing consoles  that are low-energy and that work with the wireless phone networks  instead of broadband Internet,  so that gamers all over the world,  particularly in India, China, Brazil, can get online.\\n', 'They expect one billion more gamers in the next decade.\\n', \"It will bring us up to 1.5 billion gamers. So I've started to think about  what these games are making us virtuosos at.\\n\", 'Here are the four things I came up with.\\n', 'The first is urgent optimism.\\n', 'OK, think of this as extreme self-motivation.\\n', 'Urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately  to tackle an obstacle,  combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success.\\n', \"Gamers always believe that an epic win is possible,  and that it's always worth trying, and trying now.\\n\", \"Gamers don't sit around.\\n\", 'Gamers are virtuosos at weaving a tight social fabric.\\n', \"There's a lot of interesting research that shows  we like people better after we play a game with them,  even if they've beaten us badly.\\n\", 'And the reason is, it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone.\\n', \"We trust that they will spend their time with us,  that they will play by the same rules,  value the same goal, stay with the game until it's over.\\n\", 'And so, playing a game together  actually builds up bonds and trust and cooperation.\\n', 'And we actually build stronger social relationships as a result.\\n', 'Blissful productivity. I love it.\\n', \"You know, there's a reason why the average World of Warcraft gamer  plays for 22 hours a week -- kind of a half-time job.\\n\", \"It's because we know, when we're playing a game,  that we're actually happier working hard  than we are relaxing, or hanging out.\\n\", 'We know that we are optimized as human beings,  to do hard and meaningful work.\\n', \"And gamers are willing to work hard all the time,  if they're given the right work.\\n\", 'Finally: epic meaning.\\n', 'Gamers love to be attached to awe-inspiring missions to human planetary-scale stories.\\n', 'So, just one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective:  So, you all know Wikipedia, biggest wiki in the world.\\n', 'Second biggest wiki in the world, with nearly 80,000 articles,  is the World of Warcraft wiki.\\n', 'Five million people use it every month.\\n', 'They have compiled more information about World of Warcraft on the Internet  than any other topic covered on any other wiki in the world.\\n', 'They are building an epic story.\\n', 'They are building an epic knowledge resource  about the World of Warcraft.\\n', 'Okay, so these are four superpowers that add up to one thing:  Gamers are super-empowered hopeful individuals.\\n', 'These are people who believe that they are individually capable  of changing the world.\\n', 'And the only problem is,  they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds  and not the real world.\\n', \"That's the problem that I'm trying to solve.\\n\", \"There's an economist named Edward Castronova. His work is brilliant.\\n\", 'He looks at why people are investing so much time and energy  and money in online worlds.\\n', 'And he says,  \"We\\'re witnessing what amounts to no less than a mass exodus  to virtual worlds and online game environments.\"\\n', \"And he's an economist, so he's rational.\\n\", \"And he says --    Not like me, I'm a game designer; I'm exuberant.\\n\", 'But he says that this makes perfect sense,  because gamers can achieve more in online worlds  than they can in real life.\\n', 'They can have stronger social relationships in games  than they can have in real life;  they get better feedback and feel more rewarded in games  than they do in real life.\\n', 'So he says, for now it makes perfect sense  for gamers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world.\\n', 'Now, I also agree that that is rational, for now.\\n', 'But it is not, by any means, an optimal situation.\\n', 'We have to start making the real world work more like a game.\\n', 'I take my inspiration from something that happened  2,500 years ago.\\n', \"These are ancient dice, made out of sheep's knuckles.\\n\", \"Before we had awesome game controllers,  we had sheep's knuckles.\\n\", \"And these represent the first game equipment  and if you're familiar with the work of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus,  you might know this history,  which is the history of who invented games and why.\\n\", 'Herodotus says that games, particularly dice games,  were invented in the kingdom of Lydia,  during a time of famine.\\n', 'Apparently, there was such a severe famine  that the king of Lydia decided they had to do something crazy.\\n', 'People were suffering. People were fighting.\\n', 'It was an extreme situation, they needed an extreme solution.\\n', 'So, according to Herodotus, they invented dice games,  and they set up a kingdom-wide policy:  On one day, everybody would eat,  and on the next day, everybody would play games.\\n', 'And they would be so immersed in playing the dice games,  because games are so engaging,  and immerse us in such satisfying, blissful productivity,  they would ignore the fact that they had no food to eat.\\n', 'And then on the next day, they would play games;  and on the next day, they would eat.\\n', 'And according to Herodotus,  they passed 18 years this way,  surviving through a famine,  by eating on one day, and playing games on the next.\\n', \"Now, this is exactly, I think, how we're using games today.\\n\", \"We're using games to escape real-world suffering --  we're using games to get away  from everything that's broken in the real environment,  everything that's not satisfying about real life,  and we're getting what we need from games.\\n\", \"But it doesn't have to end there.\\n\", 'This is really exciting.\\n', \"According to Herodotus, after 18 years the famine wasn't getting better,  so the king decided they would play one final dice game.\\n\", 'They divided the entire kingdom in half.\\n', 'They played one dice game,  and the winners of that game got to go on an epic adventure.\\n', 'They would leave Lydia,  and they would go out in search of a new place to live,  leaving behind just enough people  to survive on the resources that were available,  and hopefully to take their civilization somewhere else where they could thrive.\\n', 'Now, this sounds crazy, right?\\n', 'But recently, DNA evidence has shown that the Etruscans,  who then led to the Roman Empire,  actually share the same DNA as the ancient Lydians.\\n', \"And so, recently, scientists have suggested  that Herodotus' crazy story is actually true.\\n\", 'And geologists have found evidence of a global cooling  that lasted for nearly 20 years, that could have explained the famine.\\n', 'So this crazy story might be true.\\n', 'They might have actually saved their culture by playing games,  escaping to games for 18 years,  and then been so inspired,  and knew so much about how to come together with games,  that they actually saved the entire civilization that way.\\n', 'Okay, we can do that.\\n', \"We've been playing Warcraft since 1994.\\n\", 'That was the first real-time strategy game from the World of Warcraft series.\\n', \"That was 16 years ago. They played dice games for 18 years,  we've been playing Warcraft for 16 years.\\n\", 'I say we are ready for our own epic game.\\n', \"Now, they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world,  so that's where I get my 21 billion hours a week of game-play from.\\n\", \"Let's get half of us to agree  to spend an hour a day playing games,  until we solve real-world problems.\\n\", 'Now, I know you\\'re asking,  \"How are we going to solve real-world problems in games?\"\\n', \"Well, that's what I've devoted my work to over the past few years,  at the Institute for the Future.\\n\", 'We have this banner in our offices in Palo Alto,  and it expresses our view of how we should try to relate to the future.\\n', 'We do not want to try to predict the future.\\n', 'What we want to do is make the future.\\n', 'We want to imagine the best-case scenario outcome,  and then we want to empower people to make that outcome a reality.\\n', 'We want to imagine epic wins,  and then give people the means to achieve the epic win.\\n', \"I'm just going to very briefly show you three games that I've made  that are an attempt to give people the means to create epic wins  in their own futures.\\n\", 'This is World Without Oil.\\n', 'We made this game in 2007.\\n', 'in which you try to survive an oil shortage.\\n', \"The oil shortage is fictional,  but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it's real,  and to live your real life as if we've run out of oil.\\n\", \"So when you come to the game,  you sign up, tell us where you live,  and then we give you real-time news videos,  data feeds that show you exactly how much oil costs,  what's not available, how food supply is being affected,  how transportation is being affected,  if schools are closed, if there's rioting,  and you have to figure out how you would live your real life  as if this were true.

all these amazing gamers, we've got these games  that are kind of pilots of what we might do,  but none of them have saved the real world yet.\\n\", 'Well I hope you will agree with me that gamers are

Los Angeles  when he heard beautiful music.\\n', 'And the source was a man,  an African-American man,  charming, rugged, homeless,  playing a violin that only had two strings.\\n', \"And I'm telling a story that many of you know,  because Steve's columns became the basis  for a book, which was turned into a movie,  with Robert Downey Jr. acting as Steve Lopez,  and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers,  the Juilliard-trained double bassist  whose promising career was cut short  by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia.\\n\", 'Nathaniel dropped out of Juilliard, he suffered a complete breakdown,  and 30 years later he was living homeless  on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles.\\n', \"I encourage all of you to read Steve's book or to watch the movie  to understand not only the beautiful bond  that formed between these two men,  but how music helped shape that bond,  and ultimately was instrumental -- if you'll pardon the pun --  in helping Nathaniel get off the streets.\\n\", 'I met Mr. Ayers in 2008,  two years ago, at Walt Disney Concert Hall.\\n', \"He had just heard a performance of Beethoven's First and Fourth symphonies,  and came backstage and introduced himself.\\n\", \"He was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way  about Yo-Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton  and how the Dodgers were never going to make the World Series, all because of the treacherous first violin passage work  in the last movement of Beethoven's Fourth Symphony.\\n\", 'And we got talking about music, and I got an email from Steve a few days later  saying that Nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me.\\n', 'Now, I should mention that Nathaniel refuses treatment  because when he was treated it was with shock therapy  and Thorazine and handcuffs,  and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life.\\n', 'But as a result now, he is prone to  these schizophrenic episodes,  the worst of which can manifest themselves as  him exploding  and then disappearing for days,  wandering the streets of Skid Row,  exposed to its horrors, with the torment of his own mind  unleashed upon him.\\n', 'And Nathaniel was in such a state of agitation when we started our first lesson at Walt Disney Concert Hall --  he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes,  he was lost.\\n', 'And he was talking about  invisible demons and smoke,  and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep.\\n', 'And I was afraid,  not for myself, but I was afraid  that I was going to lose him,  that he was going to sink into one of his states,  and that I would ruin his relationship with the violin  if I started talking about scales  and arpeggios and other exciting forms of  didactic violin pedagogy.\\n', 'So, I just started playing.\\n', 'And I played the first movement of the Beethoven Violin Concerto.\\n', \"And as I played,  I understood that there was a profound change  occurring in Nathaniel's eyes.\\n\", 'It was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical,  a chemical reaction, for which my playing the music  was its catalyst.\\n', \"And Nathaniel's manic rage  was transformed into understanding,  a quiet curiosity and grace.\\n\", 'And in a miracle, he lifted his own violin  and he started playing, by ear,  certain snippets of violin concertos  which he then asked me to complete -- Mendelssohn,  Tchaikovsky, Sibelius.\\n', \"And we started talking about music, from Bach  to Beethoven and Brahms, Bruckner, all the B's,  from Bartók, all the way up to Esa-Pekka Salonen.\\n\", 'And I understood that he not only  had an encyclopedic knowledge of music,  but he related to this music at a personal level.\\n', 'He spoke about it with the kind of passion  and understanding that I share with my colleagues  in the Los Angeles Philharmonic.\\n', 'And through playing music and talking about music,  this man had transformed  from the paranoid, disturbed man  that had just come from walking the streets  of downtown Los Angeles  to the charming, erudite, brilliant, Juilliard-trained musician.\\n', 'Music is medicine. Music changes us.\\n', 'And for Nathaniel, music is sanity.\\n', 'Because music allows him to take his thoughts  and delusions and shape them  through his imagination and his creativity,  into reality.\\n', 'And that is an escape  from his tormented state.\\n', 'And I understood that this was the very essence of art.\\n', \"This was the very reason why we made music,  that we take something that exists within all of us  at our very fundamental core,  our emotions,  and through our artistic lens,  through our creativity, we're able to shape those emotions into reality.\\n\", 'And the reality of that expression  reaches all of us  and moves us, inspires and unites us.\\n', 'And for Nathaniel,  music brought him back into a fold of friends.\\n', 'The redemptive power of music brought him back  into a family of musicians  that understood him,  that recognized his talents  and respected him.\\n', \"And I will always make music with Nathaniel,  whether we're at Walt Disney Concert Hall  or on Skid Row, because he reminds me  why I became a musician.\\n\", 'Thank you.\\n', 'Bruno Giussani: Thank you.

doing it for the protest,  but then the last group are nation states,  governments doing the attacks.\\n', 'And then we look at cases  like what happened in DigiNotar.\\n', 'This is a prime example of what happens  when governments attack  against their own citizens.\\n', 'DigiNotar is a Certificate Authority  from The Netherlands --  or actually, it was.\\n', 'It was running into bankruptcy  last

many choices you make in typical week?\\n', 'I recently did a survey  with over 2,000 Americans,  and the average number of choices  that the typical American reports making  is about 70 in a typical day.\\n', 'There was also recently a study done with CEOs  in which they followed CEOs around for a whole week.\\n', 'And these scientists simply documented all the various tasks  that these CEOs engaged in  and how much time they spent engaging  in making decisions related to these tasks.\\n', 'And they found that the average CEO  engaged in about 139 tasks in a week.\\n', 'Each task was made up of many, many, many sub-choices of course.\\n', '50 percent of their decisions  were made in nine minutes or less.\\n', 'Only about 12 percent of the decisions  did they make an hour or more of their time.\\n', 'Think about your own choices.\\n', 'Do you know how many choices  make it into your nine minute category  versus your one hour category?\\n', \"How well do you think you're doing  at managing those choices?\\n\", 'Today I want to talk  about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have,  which is the choice overload problem.\\n', 'I want to talk about the problem  and some potential solutions.\\n', \"Now as I talk about this problem,  I'm going to have some questions for you  and I'm going to want to know your answers.\\n\", \"So when I ask you a question,  since I'm blind,  only raise your hand if you want to burn off some calories.\\n\", \"Otherwise, when I ask you a question,  and if your answer is yes,  I'd like you to clap your hands.\\n\", 'So for my first question for you today:  Are you guys ready to hear about the choice overload problem?\\n', 'Thank you.\\n', 'So when I was a graduate student at Stanford University,  I used to go to this very, very upscale grocery store;  at least at that time it was truly upscale.\\n', \"It was a store called Draeger's.\\n\", 'Now this store, it was almost like going to an amusement park.\\n', 'They had 250 different kinds of mustards and vinegars  and over 500 different kinds  of fruits and vegetables  and more than two dozen different kinds of bottled water --  and this was during a time when we actually used to drink tap water.\\n', 'I used to love going to this store,  but on one occasion I asked myself,  well how come you never buy anything?\\n', \"Here's their olive oil aisle.\\n\", 'including those that were in a locked case  that came from thousand-year-old olive trees.\\n', 'So I one day decided to pay a visit to the manager,  and I asked the manager,  \"Is this model of offering people all this choice really working?\"\\n', 'And he pointed to the busloads of tourists  that would show up everyday,  with cameras ready usually.\\n', 'We decided to do a little experiment,  and we picked jam for our experiment.\\n', \"Here's their jam aisle.\\n\", 'They had 348 different kinds of jam.\\n', 'We set up a little tasting booth  right near the entrance of the store.\\n', 'We there put out six different flavors of jam  or 24 different flavors of jam,  and we looked at two things:  First, in which case  were people more likely to stop, sample some jam?\\n', 'More people stopped when there were 24, about 60 percent,  than when there were six,  about 40 percent.\\n', 'The next thing we looked at  is in which case were people more likely  to buy a jar of jam.\\n', 'Now we see the opposite effect.\\n', 'Of the people who stopped when there were 24,  only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam.\\n', 'Of the people who stopped when there were six,  well now we saw that 30 percent of them  actually bought a jar of jam.\\n', 'Now if you do the math,  people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam  if they encountered six  than if they encountered 24.\\n', 'Now choosing not to buy a jar of jam  is probably good for us --  but it turns out that this choice overload problem affects us  even in very consequential decisions.\\n', 'We choose not to choose,  even when it goes against our best self-interests.\\n', 'So now for the topic of today: financial savings.\\n', \"Now I'm going to describe to you a study I did with Gur Huberman, Emir Kamenica, Wei Jang  where we looked at the retirement savings decisions  of nearly a million Americans from about 650 plans  all in the U.S.\\n\", \"And what we looked at  was whether the number of fund offerings  available in a retirement savings plan,  the 401 plan,  does that affect people's likelihood  to save more for tomorrow.\\n\", 'And what we found  was that indeed there was a correlation.\\n', 'So in these plans, we had about 657 plans  that ranged from offering people  anywhere from two to 59 different fund offerings.\\n', 'And what we found was that,  the more funds offered,  indeed, there was less participation rate.\\n', 'So if you look at the extremes,  those plans that offered you two funds,  participation rates were around in the mid-70s --  still not as high as we want it to be.\\n', 'In those plans that offered nearly 60 funds,  participation rates have now dropped  to about the 60th percentile.\\n', 'Now it turns out  that even if you do choose to participate  when there are more choices present,  even then, it has negative consequences.\\n', 'So for those people who did choose to participate,  the more choices available,  the more likely people were  to completely avoid stocks or equity funds.\\n', 'The more choices available,  the more likely they were  to put all their money in pure money market accounts.\\n', \"Now neither of these extreme decisions  are the kinds of decisions  that any of us would recommend for people  when you're considering their future financial well-being.\\n\", 'Well, over the past decade,  to offering people more and more choices.\\n', \"They're more likely to delay choosing --  procrastinate even when it goes against their best self-interest.\\n\", \"They're more likely to make worse choices --  worse financial choices, medical choices.\\n\", \"They're more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied,  even when they do objectively better.\\n\", \"The main reason for this  is because, we might enjoy gazing at those giant walls  of mayonnaises, mustards, vinegars, jams,  but we can't actually do the math of comparing and contrasting  and actually picking from that stunning display.\\n\", 'So what I want to propose to you today  are four simple techniques --  techniques that we have tested in one way or another  in different research venues --  that you can easily apply  in your businesses.\\n', 'The first: Cut.\\n', \"You've heard it said before,  but it's never been more true than today,  that less is more.\\n\", 'People are always upset when I say, \"Cut.\"\\n', \"They're always worried they're going to lose shelf space.\\n\", \"But in fact, what we're seeing more and more  is that if you are willing to cut,  get rid of those extraneous redundant options,  well there's an increase in sales,  there's a lowering of costs,  there is an improvement of the choosing experience.\\n\", 'When Proctor & Gamble  went from 26 different kinds of Head & Shoulders to 15,  they saw an increase in sales by 10 percent.\\n', 'got rid of their 10 worst-selling cat litter products,  they saw an increase in profits  by 87 percent --  a function of both increase in sales  and lowering of costs.\\n', 'You know, the average grocery store today  offers you 45,000 products.\\n', 'The typical Walmart today offers you 100,000 products.\\n', 'But the ninth largest retailer,  the ninth biggest retailer in the world today  is Aldi,  and it offers you only 1,400 products --  one kind of canned tomato sauce.\\n', 'Now in the financial savings world,  I think one of the best examples that has recently come out  on how to best manage the choice offerings  has actually been something that David Laibson was heavily involved in designing,  which was the program that they have at Harvard.\\n', 'Every single Harvard employee is now automatically enrolled  in a lifecycle fund.\\n', \"For those people who actually want to choose,  they're given 20 funds,  not 300 or more funds.\\n\", 'You know, often, people say,  \"I don\\'t know how to cut.\\n', 'They\\'re all important choices.\"\\n', 'And the first thing I do is I ask the employees,  \"Tell me how these choices are different from one another.\\n', 'And if your employees can\\'t tell them apart,  neither can your consumers.\"\\n', 'Now before we started our session this afternoon,  I had a chat with Gary.\\n', 'to offer people in this audience  an all-expenses-paid free vacation  to the most beautiful road in the world.\\n', \"Here's a description of the road.\\n\", \"And I'd like you to read it.\\n\", \"And now I'll give you a few seconds to read it  if you're ready to take Gary up on his offer.\\n\", \"Okay. Anybody who's ready to take him up on his offer.\\n\", 'Is that all?\\n', 'All right, let me show you some more about this.\\n', \"You guys knew there was a trick, didn't you.\\n\", \"Now who's ready to go on this trip.\\n\", 'I think I might have actually heard more hands.\\n', 'All right.\\n', 'Now in fact,  you had objectively more information  the first time around than the second time around,  but I would venture to guess  that you felt that it was more real the second time around.\\n', 'Because the pictures made it feel  more real to you.\\n', 'Which brings me to the second technique  for handling the choice overload problem,  which is concretization.\\n', 'the differences between the choices,  they have to be able to understand  the consequences associated with each choice,  and that the consequences need to be felt  in a vivid sort of way, in a very concrete way.\\n', 'Why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more  when they use an ATM card or a credit card  as opposed to cash?\\n', \"Because it doesn't feel like real money.\\n\", 'And it turns out  that making it feel more concrete  can actually be a very positive tool  to use in getting people to save more.\\n', \"So a study that I did with Shlomo Benartzi  and Alessandro Previtero,  we did a study with people at ING --  employees that are all working at ING --  and now these people were all in a session  where they're doing enrollment for their 401 plan.\\n\", 'And during that session,  we kept the session exactly the way it used to be,  but we added one little thing.\\n', 'The one little thing we added  was we asked people  to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life  if you saved more.\\n', 'By doing that simple thing,  there was an increase in enrollment by 20 percent  and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save  or the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account  by four percent.\\n', 'The third technique: Categorization.\\n', 'We can handle more categories  than we can handle choices.\\n', \"So for example,  here's a study we did in a magazine aisle.\\n\", 'It turns out that in Wegmans grocery stores  up and down the northeast corridor,  the magazine aisles range anywhere  from 331 different kinds of magazines  all the way up to 664.\\n', 'But you know what?\\n', 'If I show you 600 magazines  and I divide them up into 10 categories,  versus I show you 400 magazines  and divide them up into 20 categories,  you believe that I have given you  more choice and a better choosing experience  if I gave you the 400  Because the categories tell me how to tell them apart.\\n', 'Here are two different jewelry displays.\\n', 'One is called \"Jazz\" and the other one is called \"Swing.\"\\n', 'If you think the display on the left is Swing  and the display on the right is Jazz,  clap your hands.\\n', \"Okay, there's some.\\n\", 'If you think the one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing,  clap your hands.\\n', 'Okay, a bit more.\\n', \"Now it turns out you're right.\\n\", 'The one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing,  but you know what?\\n', 'This is a highly useless categorization scheme.\\n', 'The categories need to say something  to the chooser, not the choice-maker.\\n', 'And you often see that problem  when it comes down to those long lists of all these funds.\\n', 'Who are they actually supposed to be informing?\\n', 'My fourth technique: Condition for complexity.\\n', \"It turns out we can actually  handle a lot more information than we think we can,  we've just got to take it a little easier.\\n\", 'We have to gradually increase the complexity.\\n', \"I'm going to show you one example of what I'm talking about.\\n\", \"Let's take a very, very complicated decision:  buying a car.\\n\", \"Here's a German car manufacturer  that gives you the opportunity to completely custom make your car.\\n\", \"You've got to make 60 different decisions,  completely make up your car.\\n\", 'Now these decisions vary  in the number of choices that they offer per decision.\\n', \"Car colors, exterior car colors --  I've got 56 choices.\\n\", 'Engines, gearshift -- four choices.\\n', \"So now what I'm going to do  is I'm going to vary the order in which these decisions appear.\\n\", 'So half of the customers  are going to go from high choice, 56 car colors,  The other half of the customers  are going to go from low choice, four gearshifts,  to 56 car colors, high choice.\\n', 'What am I going to look at?\\n', 'How engaged you are.\\n', \"If you keep hitting the default button per decision,  that means you're getting overwhelmed,  that means I'm losing you.\\n\", \"What you find  is the people who go from high choice to low choice,  they're hitting that default button over and over and over again.\\n\", \"We're losing them.\\n\", \"They go from low choice to high choice,  they're hanging in there.\\n\", \"It's the same information.

single organism,  whereas before they'd built these special information processing structures,  over hundreds of thousands of years  by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fruit.\\n\", 'So that nervous system,  the fact that they built these special information structures,  tremendously sped up the whole process of evolution.\\n', 'Because evolution could now happen within an individual.\\n', 'It could happen in learning time scales.\\n', 'But then what happened  of course, tricks of communicating.\\n', \"And for example,  the most sophisticated version that we're aware of is human language.\\n\", \"It's really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it.\\n\", 'Here I have a very complicated, messy,  confused idea in my head.\\n', \"I'm sitting here making grunting sounds basically,  and hopefully constructing a similar messy, confused idea in your head  that bears some analogy to it.\\n\", \"But we're taking something very complicated,  turning it into sound, sequences of sounds,  and producing something very complicated in your brain.\\n\", 'So this allows us now  as a single organism.\\n', \"And so, in fact, what we've done  is we, humanity,  have started abstracting out.\\n\", \"We're going through the same levels  that multi-cellular organisms have gone through --  abstracting out our methods of recording,  presenting, processing information.\\n\", 'So for example, the invention of language  was a tiny step in that direction.\\n', \"Telephony, computers,  videotapes, CD-ROMs and so on  are all our specialized mechanisms  that we've now built within our society  for handling that information.\\n\", 'And it all connects us together  into something  that is much bigger  and much faster  and able to evolve  than what we were before.\\n', 'So now, evolution can take place  on a scale of microseconds.\\n', \"And you saw Ty's little evolutionary example  where he sort of did a little bit of evolution on the Convolution program right before your eyes.\\n\", \"So now we've speeded up the time scales once again.\\n\", 'So the first steps of the story that I told you about  took a billion years a piece.\\n', 'And the next steps,  like nervous systems and brains,  took a few hundred million years.\\n', 'Then the next steps, like language and so on,  took less than a million years.\\n', 'And these next steps, like electronics,  seem to be taking only a few decades.\\n', 'The process is feeding on itself  and becoming, I guess, autocatalytic is the word for it --  when something reinforces its rate of change.\\n', 'The more it changes, the faster it changes.\\n', \"And I think that that's what we're seeing here in this explosion of curve.\\n\", \"We're seeing this process feeding back on itself.\\n\", 'Now I design computers for a living,  and I know that the mechanisms that I use to design computers  would be impossible without recent advances in computers.\\n', \"So right now, what I do  is I design objects at such complexity  that it's really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense.\\n\", \"I don't know what every transistor in the connection machine does.\\n\", 'There are billions of them.\\n', 'Instead, what I do  and what the designers at Thinking Machines do  is we think at some level of abstraction  and then we hand it to the machine  and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do,  much farther and faster than we could ever do.\\n', \"And in fact, sometimes it takes it by methods  that we don't quite even understand.\\n\", \"One method that's particularly interesting  is evolution itself.\\n\", 'So what we do  is we put inside the machine  a process of evolution  that takes place on the microsecond time scale.\\n', 'So for example,  in the most extreme cases,  we can actually evolve a program  by starting out with random sequences of instructions.\\n', 'Say, \"Computer, would you please make  a hundred million random sequences of instructions.\\n', 'Now would you please run all of those random sequences of instructions,  run all of those programs,  and pick out the ones that came closest to doing what I wanted.\"\\n', 'So in other words, I define what I wanted.\\n', \"Let's say I want to sort numbers,  as a simple example I've done it with.\\n\", 'So find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers.\\n', 'So of course, random sequences of instructions  are very unlikely to sort numbers,  so none of them will really do it.\\n', 'But one of them, by luck,  may put two numbers in the right order.\\n', 'And I say, \"Computer,  of those random sequences that did the best job.\\n', 'Save those. Kill off the rest.\\n', \"And now let's reproduce  the ones that sorted numbers the best.\\n\", 'And let\\'s reproduce them by a process of recombination  analogous to sex.\"\\n', 'Take two programs and they produce children  by exchanging their subroutines,  and the children inherit the traits of the subroutines of the two programs.\\n', \"So I've got now a new generation of programs  that are produced by combinations  of the programs that did a little bit better job.\\n\", 'Say, \"Please repeat that process.\"\\n', 'Score them again.\\n', 'Introduce some mutations perhaps.\\n', 'And try that again and do that for another generation.\\n', 'Well every one of those generations just takes a few milliseconds.\\n', 'of millions of years of evolution on that  within the computer in a few minutes,  or in the complicated cases, in a few hours.\\n', 'At the end of that, I end up with programs  that are absolutely perfect at sorting numbers.\\n', 'In fact, they are programs that are much more efficient  than programs I could have ever written by hand.\\n', \"Now if I look at those programs,  I can't tell you how they work.\\n\", \"I've tried looking at them and telling you how they work.\\n\", \"They're obscure, weird programs.\\n\", 'But they do the job.\\n', \"And in fact, I know, I'm very confident that they do the job  because they come from a line  of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job.\\n\", 'In fact, their life depended on doing the job.\\n', 'I was riding in a 747  and he pulls out this card and says, \"Oh look. Look at this.\\n', 'It says, \\'This plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe flight.\\'  Doesn\\'t that make you feel confident?\"\\n', \"In fact, we know that the engineering process doesn't work very well  when it gets complicated.\\n\", \"So we're beginning to depend on computers  to do a process that's very different than engineering.\\n\", \"And it lets us produce things of much more complexity  And yet, we don't quite understand the options of it.\\n\", \"So in a sense, it's getting ahead of us.\\n\", \"We're now using those programs  to make much faster computers  so that we'll be able to run this process much faster.\\n\", \"So it's feeding back on itself.\\n\", \"The thing is becoming faster  and that's why I think it seems so confusing.\\n\", 'Because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves.\\n', \"We're taking off.\\n\", \"And what we are is we're at a point in time  which is analogous to when single-celled organisms  were turning into multi-celled organisms.\\n\", \"So we're the amoebas  and we can't quite figure out what the hell this thing is we're creating.\\n\", \"We're right at that point of transition.\\n\", 'But I think that there really is something coming along after us.\\n', \"to think that we're the end product of evolution.\\n\", 'And I think all of us here  are a part of producing  whatever that next thing is.\\n', '', 'I am a writer.\\n', \"Writing books is my profession but it's more than that, of course.\\n\", 'It is also my great lifelong love and fascination.\\n', \"And I don't expect that that's ever going to change.\\n\", 'But, that said, something kind of peculiar has happened recently  in my life and in my career,  which has caused me to have to recalibrate my whole relationship with this work.\\n', 'And the peculiar thing is that I recently wrote this book,  this memoir called \"Eat, Pray, Love\"  which, decidedly unlike any of my previous books,  went out in the world for some reason, and became this big,  mega-sensation, international bestseller thing.\\n', \"The result of which is that everywhere I go now,  people treat me like I'm doomed.\\n\", 'Seriously -- doomed, doomed!\\n', 'Like, they come up to me now, all worried, and they say,  \"Aren\\'t you afraid you\\'re never going to be able to top that?\\n', 'Aren\\'t you afraid you\\'re going to keep writing for your whole life  and you\\'re never again going to create a book  that anybody in the world cares about at all,  ever again?\"\\n', \"So that's reassuring, you know.\\n\", 'But it would be worse, except for that I happen to remember  that over 20 years ago, when I was a teenager,  when I first started telling people that I wanted to be a writer,  I was met with this same sort of fear-based reaction.\\n', 'And people would say, \"Aren\\'t you afraid you\\'re never going to have any success?\\n', \"Aren't you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you?\\n\", \"Aren't you afraid that you're going to work your whole life at this craft  and nothing's ever going to come of it  and you're going to die on a scrap heap of broken dreams    Like that, you know.\\n\", 'The answer -- the short answer to all those questions is, \"Yes.\"\\n', \"Yes, I'm afraid of all those things.\\n\", 'And I always have been.\\n', \"And I'm afraid of many, many more things besides  that people can't even guess at,  like seaweed and other things that are scary.\\n\", \"But, when it comes to writing,  the thing that I've been sort of thinking about lately, and wondering about lately,  You know, is it rational?\\n\", 'Is it logical that anybody should be expected  to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do.\\n', \"And what is it specifically about creative ventures  that seems to make us really nervous about each other's mental health  in a way that other careers kind of don't do, you know?\\n\", \"Like my dad, for example, was a chemical engineer  and I don't recall once in his 40 years of chemical engineering  anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer, you know?\\n\", '\"That chemical-engineering block, John, how\\'s it going?\"\\n', \"It just didn't come up like that, you know?\\n\", \"But to be fair, chemical engineers as a group  haven't really earned a reputation over the centuries    We writers, we kind of do have that reputation,  and not just writers, but creative people across all genres,  it seems, have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable.\\n\", 'And all you have to do is look at the very grim death count  in the 20th century alone, of really magnificent creative minds  who died young and often at their own hands, you know?\\n', \"And even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide  seem to be really undone by their gifts, you know.\\n\", 'Norman Mailer, just before he died, last interview, he said,  \"Every one of my books has killed me a little more.\"\\n', \"An extraordinary statement to make about your life's work.\\n\", \"But we don't even blink when we hear somebody say this,  because we've heard that kind of stuff for so long  and somehow we've completely internalized and accepted collectively  this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked  and that artistry, in the end, will always ultimately lead to anguish.\\n\", 'And the question that I want to ask everybody here today  is are you guys all cool with that idea?\\n', 'Are you comfortable with that?\\n', \"Because you look at it even from an inch away and, you know --  I'm not at all comfortable with that assumption.\\n\", \"I think it's odious.\\n\", \"And I also think it's dangerous,  and I don't want to see it perpetuated into the next century.\\n\", \"I think it's better if we encourage our great creative minds to live.\\n\", \"And I definitely know that, in my case -- in my situation --  it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path  of assumption,  particularly given the circumstance that I'm in right now in my career.\\n\", \"Which is -- you know, like check it out,  I'm pretty young, I'm only about 40 years old.\\n\", 'I still have maybe another four decades of work left in me.\\n', \"And it's exceedingly likely that anything I write from this point forward  is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after  the freakish success of my last book, right?\\n\", \"I should just put it bluntly, because we're all sort of friends here now --  it's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me.\\n\", 'So Jesus, what a thought!\\n', \"That's the kind of thought that could lead a person  to start drinking gin at nine o'clock in the morning,  and I don't want to go there.\\n\", 'I would prefer to keep doing this work that I love.\\n', 'And so, the question becomes, how?\\n', 'And so, it seems to me, upon a lot of reflection,  that the way that I have to work now, in order to continue writing,  is that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construct, right?\\n', 'I have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance  between me, as I am writing, and my very natural anxiety  about what the reaction to that writing is going to be, from now on.\\n', \"And, as I've been looking, over the last year,  I've been sort of looking across time,  and I've been trying to find other societies  to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have  about how to help creative people  sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity.\\n\", 'And that search has led me to ancient Greece and ancient Rome.\\n', 'So stay with me, because it does circle around and back.\\n', 'But, ancient Greece and ancient Rome --  people did not happen to believe that creativity  came from human beings back then, OK?\\n', 'People believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit  that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source,  for distant and unknowable reasons.\\n', 'The Greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity \"daemons.\"\\n', 'Socrates, famously, believed that he had a daemon  who spoke wisdom to him from afar.\\n', 'The Romans had the same idea,  but they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius.\\n', 'Which is great, because the Romans did not actually think  that a genius was a particularly clever individual.\\n', \"They believed that a genius was this, sort of magical divine entity,  who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist's studio,  kind of like Dobby the house elf,  and sort of invisibly assist the artist with their work  and would shape the outcome of that work.\\n\", \"So brilliant -- there it is, right there, that distance that I'm talking about --  that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work.\\n\", 'And everyone knew that this is how it functioned, right?\\n', 'So the ancient artist was protected from certain things,  like, for example, too much narcissism, right?\\n', \"If your work was brilliant, you couldn't take all the credit for it,  everybody knew that you had this disembodied genius who had helped you.\\n\", 'If your work bombed, not entirely your fault, you know?\\n', 'Everyone knew your genius was kind of lame.\\n', 'And this is how people thought about creativity in the West for a really long time.\\n', \"And then the Renaissance came and everything changed,  and we had this big idea, and the big idea was,  let's put the individual human being at the center of the universe  above all gods and mysteries,  and there's no more room for mystical creatures who take dictation from the divine.\\n\", \"And it's the beginning of rational humanism,  and people started to believe that creativity  came completely from the self of the individual.\\n\", 'And for the first time in history,  you start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius,  rather than having a genius.\\n', 'And I got to tell you, I think that was a huge error.\\n', 'You know, I think that allowing somebody, one mere person  to believe that he or she is like, the vessel,  of all divine, creative, unknowable, eternal mystery  is just a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile, human psyche.\\n', \"It's like asking somebody to swallow the sun.\\n\", 'It just completely warps and distorts egos,  and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance.\\n', 'And I think the pressure of that  has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years.\\n', 'And, if this is true,  and I think it is true,  the question becomes, what now?\\n', 'Can we do this differently?\\n', 'about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery.\\n', 'Maybe not.\\n', \"Maybe we can't just erase 500 years of rational humanistic thought  in one 18 minute speech.\\n\", \"And there's probably people in this audience  who would raise really legitimate scientific suspicions  about the notion of, basically, fairies  who follow people around rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff.\\n\", \"I'm not, probably, going to bring you all along with me on this.\\n\", 'But the question that I kind of want to pose is --  you know, why not?\\n', 'Why not think about it this way?\\n', 'Because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard  in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness  of the creative process.\\n', 'A process which, as anybody who has ever tried to make something --  which is to say basically everyone here ---  knows does not always behave rationally.\\n', 'And, in fact, can sometimes feel downright paranormal.\\n', \"I had this encounter recently where I met the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone,  who's now in her 90s, but she's been a poet her entire life  and she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virginia,  she would be out working in the fields,  and she said she would feel and hear a poem  coming at her from over the landscape.\\n\", 'And she said it was like a thunderous train of air.\\n', 'And it would come barreling down at her over the landscape.\\n', 'And she felt it coming, because it would shake the earth under her feet.\\n', 'She knew that she had only one thing to do at that point,  and that was to, in her words, \"run like hell.\"\\n', 'And she would run like hell to the house  and she would be getting chased by this poem,  and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil  fast enough so that when it thundered through her, she could collect it  and grab it on the page.\\n', 'And other times she wouldn\\'t be fast enough,  so she\\'d be running and running, and she wouldn\\'t get to the house  and the poem would barrel through her and she would miss it  and she said it would continue on across the landscape,  looking, as she put it \"for another poet.\"\\n', 'And then there were these times --  this is the piece I never forgot --  she said that there were moments where she would almost miss it, right?\\n', \"So, she's running to the house and she's looking for the paper  and the poem passes through her,  and she grabs a pencil just as it's going through her,  and then she said, it was like she would reach out with her other hand  and she would catch it.\\n\", 'She would catch the poem by its tail,  and she would pull it backwards into her body  as she was transcribing on the page.\\n', 'And in these instances, the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact  but backwards, from the last word to the first.\\n', \"So when I heard that I was like -- that's uncanny,  that's exactly what my creative process is like.\\n\", \"That's not at all what my creative process is -- I'm not the pipeline!\\n\", \"I'm a mule, and the way that I have to work  is I have to get up at the same time every day,  and sweat and labor and barrel through it really awkwardly.\\n\", 'But even I, in my mulishness,  even I have brushed up against that thing, at times.\\n', 'And I would imagine that a lot of you have too.\\n', 'You know, even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source  that I honestly cannot identify.\\n', 'And what is that thing?\\n', 'And how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds,  but, in fact, might actually keep us sane?\\n', 'And for me, the best contemporary example that I have of how to do that  is the musician Tom Waits,  who I got to interview several years ago on a magazine assignment.\\n', 'And we were talking about this,  and you know, Tom, for most of his life, he was pretty much the embodiment  of the tormented contemporary modern artist,  trying to control and manage and dominate  these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses  that were totally internalized.\\n', 'But then he got older, he got calmer,  and one day he was driving down the freeway in Los Angeles,  and this is when it all changed for him.\\n', \"And he's speeding along, and all of a sudden  he hears this little fragment of melody,  that comes into his head as inspiration often comes, elusive and tantalizing,  and he wants it, it's gorgeous,  and he longs for it, but he has no way to get it.\\n\", \"He doesn't have a piece of paper, or a pencil, or a tape recorder.\\n\", 'So he starts to feel all of that old anxiety start to rise in him  like, \"I\\'m going to lose this thing,  and I\\'ll be be haunted by this song forever.\\n', 'I\\'m not good enough, and I can\\'t do it.\"\\n', 'And instead of panicking, he just stopped.\\n', 'He just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel.\\n', 'He just looked up at the sky, and he said,  \"Excuse me, can you not see that I\\'m driving?\"\\n', '\"Do I look like I can write down a song right now?\\n', 'If you really want to exist, come back at a more opportune moment  when I can take care of you.\\n', 'Otherwise, go bother somebody else today.\\n', 'Go bother Leonard Cohen.\"\\n', 'And his whole work process changed after that.\\n', 'Not the work, the work was still oftentimes as dark as ever.\\n', \"But the process, and the heavy anxiety around it  was released when he took the genie, the genius out of him  where it was causing nothing but trouble, and released it back where it came from,  and realized that this didn't have to be this internalized, tormented thing.\\n\", 'It could be this peculiar, wondrous, bizarre collaboration,  kind of conversation between Tom and the strange, external thing  that was not quite Tom.\\n', 'When I heard that story, it started to shift a little bit  the way that I worked too, and this idea already

just dump this project.\\n', 'But then I remembered Tom talking to the open air  and I tried it.\\n', 'So I just lifted my face up from the manuscript  and I directed my comments to an empty corner of

a notebook  that is used by a maintenance engineer  to configure this gray box,  then we are in business.\\n', 'And this is the plot behind Stuxnet.\\n', 'So we start with a Windows dropper.\\n', 'The payload goes onto the gray box,  damages the centrifuge,  and the Iranian nuclear program is delayed --  mission accomplished.\\n', \"That's easy, huh?\\n\", 'I want to tell you how we found that out.\\n', 'When we started our research on Stuxnet six months ago,  it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was.\\n', \"The only thing that was known  is it's very, very complex on the Windows part, the dropper part,  used multiple zero-day vulnerabilities.\\n\", 'And it seemed to want to do something  with these gray boxes, these real-time control systems.\\n', 'So that got our attention,  and we started a lab project  where we infected our environment with Stuxnet  and checked this thing out.\\n', 'And then some very funny things happened.\\n', \"Stuxnet behaved like a lab rat  that didn't like our cheese --  sniffed, but didn't want to eat.\\n\", \"Didn't make sense to me.\\n\", 'And after we experimented with different flavors of cheese,  I realized, well, this is a directed attack.\\n', \"It's completely directed.\\n\", \"The dropper is prowling actively  on the gray box  if a specific configuration is found,  and even if the actual program code that it's trying to infect  is actually running on that target.\\n\", 'And if not, Stuxnet does nothing.\\n', 'So that really got my attention,  and we started to work on this  nearly around the clock,  because I thought, \"Well, we don\\'t know what the target is.\\n', \"It could be, let's say for example,  a U.S. power plant,  or a chemical plant in Germany.\\n\", 'So we better find out what the target is soon.\"\\n', \"So we extracted and decompiled  the attack code,  and we discovered that it's structured in two digital bombs --  a smaller one and a bigger one.\\n\", 'And we also saw that they are very professionally engineered  by people who obviously had all insider information.\\n', 'They knew all the bits and bites  that they had to attack.\\n', 'They probably even know the shoe size of the operator.\\n', 'So they know everything.\\n', 'And if you have heard that the dropper of Stuxnet  is complex and high-tech,  let me tell you this:  the payload is rocket science.\\n', \"It's way above everything  that we have ever seen before.\\n\", 'Here you see a sample of this actual attack code.\\n', 'We are talking about --  around about 15,000 lines of code.\\n', 'Looks pretty much like old-style assembly language.\\n', 'And I want to tell you how we were able  to make sense out of this code.\\n', 'So what we were looking for is, first of all, system function calls,  because we know what they do.\\n', 'And then we were looking for timers and data structures  and trying to relate them to the real world --  to potential real world targets.\\n', 'So we do need target theories  that we can prove or disprove.\\n', \"In order to get target theories,  we remember  that it's definitely hardcore sabotage,  it must be a high-value target  and it is most likely located in Iran,  because that's where most of the infections had been reported.\\n\", \"Now you don't find several thousand targets in that area.\\n\", 'to the Bushehr nuclear power plant  and to the Natanz fuel enrichment plant.\\n', 'So I told my assistant,  \"Get me a list of all centrifuge and power plant experts from our client base.\"\\n', 'And I phoned them up and picked their brain  in an effort to match their expertise  with what we found in code and data.\\n', 'And that worked pretty well.\\n', 'So we were able to associate  the small digital warhead  with the rotor control.\\n', 'The rotor is that moving part within the centrifuge,  that black object that you see.\\n', 'And if you manipulate the speed of this rotor,  you are actually able to crack the rotor  and eventually even have the centrifuge explode.\\n', 'What we also saw  is that the goal of the attack  was really to do it slowly and creepy --  obviously in an effort  to drive maintenance engineers crazy,  that they would not be able to figure this out quickly.\\n', 'The big digital warhead -- we had a shot at this  by looking very closely  at data and data structures.\\n', \"So for example, the number 164  really stands out in that code;  you can't overlook it.\\n\", 'I started to research scientific literature  on how these centrifuges  are actually built in Natanz  and found they are structured  in what is called a cascade,  and each cascade holds 164 centrifuges.\\n', 'So that made sense, that was a match.\\n', 'And it even got better.\\n', 'These centrifuges in Iran  are subdivided into 15, what is called, stages.\\n', 'And guess what we found in the attack code?\\n', 'An almost identical structure.\\n', 'So again, that was a real good match.\\n', 'And this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at.\\n', \"Now don't get me wrong here, it didn't go like this.\\n\", 'These results have been obtained  over several weeks of really hard labor.\\n', 'And we often went into just a dead end  and had to recover.\\n', 'Anyway, so we figured out  that both digital warheads  were actually aiming at one and the same target,  but from different angles.\\n', 'The small warhead is taking one cascade,  and spinning up the rotors and slowing them down,  and the big warhead  is talking to six cascades  and manipulating valves.\\n', 'So in all, we are very confident  that we have actually determined what the target is.\\n', 'It is Natanz, and it is only Natanz.\\n', \"So we don't have to worry  that other targets  might be hit by Stuxnet.\\n\", \"Here's some very cool stuff that we saw --  really knocked my socks off.\\n\", 'Down there is the gray box,  and on the top you see the centrifuges.\\n', 'Now what this thing does  is it intercepts the input values from sensors --  so for example, from pressure sensors  and vibration sensors --  and it provides legitimate program code,  which is still running during the attack,  with fake input data.\\n', 'And as a matter of fact, this fake input data  is actually prerecorded by Stuxnet.\\n', \"So it's just like from the Hollywood movies  where during the heist,  the observation camera is fed with prerecorded video.\\n\", \"That's cool, huh?\\n\", 'The idea here is obviously  not only to fool the operators in the control room.\\n', 'It actually is much more dangerous and aggressive.\\n', 'The idea  is to circumvent a digital safety system.\\n', 'We need digital safety systems  where a human operator could not act quick enough.\\n', 'So for example, in a power plant,  when your big steam turbine gets too over speed,  you must open relief valves within a millisecond.\\n', 'Obviously, this cannot be done by a human operator.\\n', 'So this is where we need digital safety systems.\\n', 'And when they are compromised,  then real bad things can happen.\\n', 'Your plant can blow up.\\n', 'And neither your operators nor your safety system will notice it.\\n', \"That's scary.\\n\", 'But it gets worse.\\n', \"And this is very important, what I'm going to say.\\n\", 'Think about this:  this attack is generic.\\n', \"It doesn't have anything to do, in specifics,  with centrifuges,  with uranium enrichment.\\n\", 'So it would work as well, for example,  in a power plant  or in an automobile factory.\\n', 'It is generic.\\n', \"And you don't have -- as an attacker --  you don't have to deliver this payload  by a USB stick,  as we saw it in the case of Stuxnet.\\n\", 'You could also use conventional worm technology for spreading.\\n', 'Just spread it as wide as possible.\\n', 'And if you do that,  what you end up with  is a cyber weapon of mass destruction.\\n', \"That's the consequence  that we have to face.\\n\", 'So unfortunately,  the biggest number of targets for such attacks  are not in the Middle East.\\n', \"They're in the United States and Europe and in Japan.\\n\", 'So all of the green areas,  these are your target-rich environments.\\n', 'We have to face the consequences,  and we better start to prepare right now.\\n', 'Thanks.\\n', \"Chris Anderson: I've got a question.\\n\", \"Ralph, it's been quite widely reported  that people assume that Mossad  is the main entity behind this.\\n\", 'Is

developed at MIT in a workshop  was, imagine this pipe, and you've got valves,  solenoid valves, taps,  opening and closing.\\n\", 'You create like a water curtain with pixels made of water.\\n', 'If those pixels fall,  you can write on it,  you can show patterns, images, text.\\n', 'And even you can approach it, and it will open up  to let you jump through,  as you see in this image.\\n', 'Well, we presented this to Mayor Belloch.\\n', 'He liked it very much.\\n', 'And we got a commission to design a building  at the entrance of the expo.\\n', 'We called it Digital Water Pavilion.\\n', 'The whole building is made of water.\\n', \"There's no doors or windows,  but when you approach it,  it will open up to let you in.\\n\", 'The roof also is covered with water.\\n', \"And if there's a bit of wind,  if you want to minimize splashing, you can actually lower the roof.\\n\", 'Or you could close the building,  and the whole architecture will disappear,  like in this case.\\n', 'You know, these days, you always get images during the winter,  when they take the roof down,  of people who have been there and said, \"They demolished the building.\"\\n', \"No, they didn't demolish it, just when it goes down,  the architecture almost disappears.\\n\", \"Here's the building working.\\n\", 'You see the person puzzled about what was going on inside.\\n', 'And here was myself trying not to get wet,  testing the sensors that open the water.\\n', 'Well, I should tell you now what happened one night  when all of the sensors stopped working.\\n', 'But actually that night, it was even more fun.\\n', 'All the kids from Zaragoza came to the building,  because the way of engaging with the building became something different.\\n', 'Not anymore a building that would open up to let you in,  but a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water,  and you had to jump without getting wet.\\n', 'And that was, for us, was very interesting,  because, as architects, as engineers, as designers,  we always think about how people will use the things we design.\\n', \"But then reality's always unpredictable.\\n\", \"And that's the beauty of doing things  that are used and interact with people.\\n\", 'Here is an image then of the building  with the physical pixels, the pixels made of water,  and then projections on them.\\n', \"the following project I'll show you now.\\n\", \"That's, imagine those pixels could actually start flying.\\n\", 'Imagine you could have small helicopters  that move in the air,  and then each of them with a small pixel in changing lights --  almost as a cloud that can move in space.\\n', 'Here is the video.\\n', 'So imagine one helicopter,  moving with others,  in synchrony.\\n', 'So you can have this cloud.\\n', 'You can have a kind of flexible screen or display, like this --  a regular configuration in two dimensions.\\n', \"Or in regular, but in three dimensions,  where the thing that changes is the light,  not the pixels' position.\\n\", 'You can play with a different type.\\n', 'Imagine your screen could just appear  in different scales or sizes,  different types of resolution.\\n', 'But then the whole thing can be  just a 3D cloud of pixels  that you can approach and move through it  and see from many, many directions.\\n', 'Here is the real Flyfire  control and going down to form the regular grid as before.\\n', 'When you turn on the light, actually you see this. So the same as we saw before.\\n', 'And imagine each of them then controlled by people.\\n', \"You can have each pixel  having an input that comes from people,  from people's movement, or so and so.\\n\", 'I want to show you something here for the first time.\\n', \"We've been working with Roberto Bolle,  one of today's top ballet dancers --  the étoile at Metropolitan in New York  and La Scala in Milan --  and actually captured his movement in 3D  in order to use it as an input for Flyfire.\\n\", 'And here you can see Roberto dancing.\\n', 'You see on the left the pixels,  the different resolutions being captured.\\n', \"It's both 3D scanning in real time  and motion capture.\\n\", 'So you can reconstruct a whole movement.\\n', 'You can go all the way through.\\n', 'But then, once we have the pixels, then you can play with them  and play with color and movement  and gravity and rotation.\\n', 'So we want to use this as one of the possible inputs  for Flyfire.\\n', 'I wanted to show you the last project we are working on.\\n', \"It's something we're working on for the London Olympics.\\n\", \"It's called The Cloud.\\n\", 'And the idea here is, imagine, again,  we can involve people  in doing something and changing our environment --  almost to impart what we call cloud raising --  like barn raising, but with a cloud.\\n', 'Imagine you can have everybody make a small donation for one pixel.\\n', 'And I think what is remarkable  that has happened over the past couple of years  is that, over the past couple of decades,  we went from the physical world to the digital one.\\n', 'This has been digitizing everything, knowledge,  and making that accessible through the Internet.\\n', 'Now today, for the first time --  and the Obama campaign showed us this --  we can go from the digital world,  from the self-organizing power of networks,  to the physical one.\\n', 'This can be, in our case,  we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol.\\n', 'That means something built in a city.\\n', \"But tomorrow it can be,  in order to tackle today's pressing challenges --  think about climate change or CO2 emissions --  how we can go from the digital world to the physical one.\\n\", 'So the idea that we can actually involve people  in doing this thing together, collectively.\\n', 'The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels,  in the same way as the real cloud  is a cloud made of particles.\\n', 'And those particles are water,  where our cloud is a cloud of pixels.\\n', \"It's a physical structure in London, but covered with pixels.\\n\", 'You can move inside, have different types of experiences.\\n', 'You can actually see from underneath,  sharing the main moments  for the Olympics in 2012 and beyond,  and really using it as a way to connect with the community.\\n', \"So both the physical cloud in the sky  and something you can go to the top [of],  like London's new mountaintop.\\n\", 'You can enter inside it.\\n', 'And a kind of new digital beacon for the night --  but most importantly,  a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top.\\n', '', 'My name is Amit.\\n', \"And 18 months ago, I had another job at Google,  and I pitched this idea  of doing something with museums and art  to my boss who's actually here,  and she allowed me to do it.\\n\", 'And it took 18 months.\\n', 'A lot of fun, negotiations and stories, I can tell you,  with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries.\\n', \"But I'm going to focus on the demo.\\n\", 'There are a lot of stories about why we did this.\\n', 'I think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide,  And I grew up in India.\\n', \"I had a great education -- I'm not complaining --  but I didn't have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks.\\n\", 'And so when I started traveling and going to these museums,  I started learning a lot.\\n', 'And while working at Google,  I tried to put this desire  to make it more accessible with technology together.\\n', 'So we formed a team, a great team of people,  and we started doing this.\\n', \"I'm going to probably get into the demo  and then tell you a couple of the interesting things  we've had since launch.\\n\", 'So, simple: you come to GoogleArtProject.com.\\n', 'You look around at all these museums here.\\n', \"You've got the Uffizi, you've got the MoMA,  the Hermitage, the Rijks, the Van Gogh.\\n\", \"I'm going to actually get to one of my favorites,  the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.\\n\", 'Two ways of going in -- very simple.\\n', \"Click and, bang, you're in this museum.\\n\", \"It doesn't matter where you are --  Bombay, Mexico, it doesn't really matter.\\n\", 'You move around, you have fun.\\n', 'You want to navigate around the museum?\\n', 'Open the plan up,  and, in one click, jump.\\n', \"You're in there, you want to go to the end of the corridor.\\n\", 'Keep going.

That sounds interesting.\"\\n', 'Went in, and I started noticing  that these kids were actually beating something.\\n', 'I did a little research, spoke to a couple of my contacts at the Met,  and actually found out that this is a game  called squall,  which involves beating a goose with a stick  on Shrove Tuesday.\\n', 'And apparently it was quite popular.\\n', \"I don't know why they did it,  but I learned something about it.\\n\", 'Now just to get really deep in, you can really get to the cracks.\\n', \"Now just to give you some perspective,  I'm going to zoom out so you really see what you get.\\n\", 'Here is where we were,  and this is the painting.\\n', 'The best is yet to come -- so in a second.\\n', \"So now let's just quickly  jump into the MoMA, again in New York.\\n\", 'So another one of my favorites, \"The Starry Night.\"\\n', 'Now the example I showed you was all about finding details.\\n', 'But what if you want to see brush strokes?\\n', 'how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece?\\n', 'You zoom in. You really go in.\\n', \"I'm going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting,  and I'm really going to get to the cracks.\\n\", 'This is \"The Starry Night,\"  I think, never seen like this before.\\n', \"I'm going to show you my other favorite feature.\\n\", \"There's a lot of other stuff here, but I don't have time.\\n\", \"This is the real cool part.

Thank you.\\n\", '', \"This may sound strange,  but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.\\n\", 'The first concrete blocks were manufactured in 1868  with a very simple idea:  modules made of cement of a fixed measurement  that fit together.\\n', 'Very quickly concrete blocks became  the most-used construction unit in the world.\\n', 'They enabled us to to build things that were larger than us,  buildings, bridges,  one brick at a time.\\n', 'Essentially concrete blocks had become  the building block of our time.\\n', 'Almost a hundred years later in 1947,  LEGO came up with this.\\n', 'It was called the Automatic Binding Brick.\\n', 'And in a few short years,  LEGO bricks took place in every household.\\n', \"It's estimated that over 400 billion bricks have been produced --  or 75 bricks for every person on the planet.\\n\", \"You don't have to be an engineer  to make beautiful houses, beautiful bridges, beautiful buildings.\\n\", 'LEGO made it accessible.\\n', 'LEGO has essentially taken the concrete block, the building block of the world,  and made it into the building block  of our imagination.\\n', 'Meanwhile the exact same year,  at Bell Labs the next revolution was about to be announced,  the next building block.\\n', 'The transistor was a small plastic unit  that would take us from a world  of static bricks piled on top of each other  to a world where everything was interactive.\\n', 'Like the concrete block,  the transistor allows you to build  much larger, more complex circuits, one brick at a time.\\n', \"But there's a main difference:  The transistor was only for experts. I personally don't accept this,  that the building block of our time  is reserved for experts,  so I decided to change that.\\n\", 'Eight years ago when I was at the Media Lab,  I started exploring this idea  of how to put the power of engineers  in the hands of artists and designers.\\n', 'A few years ago I started developing littleBits.\\n', 'Let me show you how they work.\\n', 'LittleBits are electronic modules  with each one specific function.\\n', \"They're pre-engineered  to be light, sound,  motors and sensors.\\n\", 'And the best part about it  is they snap together with magnets.\\n', \"So you can't put them the wrong way.\\n\", 'The bricks are color-coded.\\n', 'Green is output, blue is power,  pink is input and orange is wire.\\n', 'So all you need to do is snap a blue to a green  and very quickly you can start making larger circuits.\\n', 'You put a blue to a green,  you can make light.\\n', \"You can put a knob in between  and now you've made a little dimmer.\\n\", \"Switch out the knob  for a pulse module,  which is here,  and now you've made a little blinker.\\n\", \"Add this buzzer for some extra punch  and you've created a noise machine.\\n\", \"I'm going to stop that.\\n\", 'So beyond simple play,  littleBits are actually pretty powerful.\\n', 'Instead of having to program, to wire, to solder,  littleBits allow you to program using very simple intuitive gestures.\\n', 'So to make this blink faster or slower,  you would just turn this knob  and basically make it pulse faster or slower.\\n', \"The idea behind littleBits  is that it's a growing library.\\n\", 'We want to make every single interaction in the world  into a ready-to-use brick.\\n', 'Lights, sounds, solar panels, motors --  everything should be accessible.\\n', \"We've been giving littleBits to kids and seeing them play with them.\\n\", \"And it's been an incredible experience.\\n\", \"The nicest thing is how they start to understand  the electronics around them from everyday  that they don't learn at schools.\\n\", 'For example, how a nightlight works,  or why an elevator door stays open,  or how an iPod responds to touch.\\n', \"We've also been taking littleBits to design schools.\\n\", 'with no experience with electronics whatsoever  start to play with littleBits as a material.\\n', 'Here you see, with felt and paper water bottles,  we have Geordie making ...\\n', 'A few weeks ago we took littleBits to RISD  and gave them to some designers  with no experience in engineering whatsoever --  just cardboard, wood and paper -- and told them \"Make something.\"\\n', \"Here's an example of a project they made,  a motion-activated confetti canon ball.\\n\", 'But wait, this is actually my favorite project.\\n', \"It's a lobster made of playdough  that's afraid of the dark.\\n\", 'To these non-engineers, littleBits became another material,  electronics became just another material.\\n', 'And we want to make this material accessible to everyone.\\n', 'So littleBits is open-source.\\n', 'You can go on the website, download all the design files, make them yourself.\\n', 'We want to encourage a world of creators, of inventors, of contributors,  because this world that we live in,  this interactive world, is ours.\\n', 'So go ahead and start inventing.\\n', '', \"I'm going to talk today about energy and climate.\\n\", 'And that might seem a bit surprising because  my full-time work at the Foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds,  to help the poorest two billion live better lives.\\n', 'But energy and climate are extremely important to these people --  in fact, more important than to anyone else on the planet.\\n', \"The climate getting worse means that many years, their crops won't grow:  There will be too much rain, not enough rain,  that their fragile environment simply can't support.\\n\", 'And that leads to starvation, it leads to uncertainty, it leads to unrest.\\n', 'So, the climate changes will be terrible for them.\\n', 'Also, the price of energy is very important to them.\\n', 'In fact, if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of,  to reduce poverty, by far you would pick energy.\\n', 'Now, the price of energy has come down over time.\\n', 'Really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy.\\n', \"The coal revolution fueled the Industrial Revolution,  and, even in the 1900s we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity,  and that's why we have refrigerators, air-conditioning,  we can make modern materials and do so many things.\\n\", \"And so, we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world.\\n\", \"But, as we make it cheaper -- and let's go for making it twice as cheap --  we need to meet a new constraint,  and that constraint has to do with CO2.\\n\", 'CO2 is warming the planet,  and the equation on CO2 is actually a very straightforward one.\\n', \"If you sum up the CO2 that gets emitted,  that leads to a temperature increase,  and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects:  the effects on the weather; perhaps worse, the indirect effects,  in that the natural ecosystems can't adjust to these rapid changes,  and so you get ecosystem collapses.\\n\", \"Now, the exact amount of how you map  from a certain increase of CO2 to what temperature will be  and where the positive feedbacks are,  there's some uncertainty there, but not very much.\\n\", \"And there's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be,  but they will be extremely bad.\\n\", 'I asked the top scientists on this several times:  Do we really have to get down to near zero?\\n', \"Can't we just cut it in half or a quarter?\\n\", 'And the answer is that until we get near to zero,  the temperature will continue to rise.\\n', \"And so that's a big challenge.\\n\", 'It\\'s very different than saying \"We\\'re a twelve-foot-high truck trying to get under a ten-foot bridge,  and we can just sort of squeeze under.\"\\n', 'This is something that has to get to zero.\\n', 'Now, we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year,  over 26 billion tons.\\n', \"For each American, it's about 20 tons;  for people in poor countries, it's less than one ton.\\n\", \"It's an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet.\\n\", 'And, somehow, we have to make changes  that will bring that down to zero.\\n', \"It's been constantly going up.\\n\", \"It's only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all,  so we have to go from rapidly rising  to falling, and falling all the way to zero.\\n\", \"This equation has four factors,  a little bit of multiplication:  So, you've got a thing on the left, CO2, that you want to get to zero,  and that's going to be based on the number of people,  the services each person's using on average,  the energy on average for each service,  and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy.\\n\", \"So, let's look at each one of these  and see how we can get this down to zero.\\n\", 'Probably, one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.\\n', \"Now that's back from high school algebra,  but let's take a look.\\n\", \"First, we've got population.\\n\", 'The world today has 6.8 billion people.\\n', \"That's headed up to about nine billion.\\n\", 'Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines,  health care, reproductive health services,  we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent,  but there we see an increase of about 1.3.\\n', 'The second factor is the services we use.\\n', 'This encompasses everything:  the food we eat, clothing, TV, heating.\\n', 'These are very good things:  getting rid of poverty means providing these services  to almost everyone on the planet.\\n', \"And it's a great thing for this number to go up.\\n\", 'In the rich world, perhaps the top one billion,  we probably could cut back and use less,  but every year, this number, on average, is going to go up,  and so, over all, that will more than double  the services delivered per person.\\n', 'Here we have a very basic service:  Do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework?\\n', \"And, in fact, these kids don't, so they're going out  and reading their school work under the street lamps.\\n\", 'Now, efficiency, E, the energy for each service,  here finally we have some good news.\\n', \"We have something that's not going up.\\n\", 'Through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting,  through different types of cars, different ways of building buildings --  there are a lot of services where you can bring  the energy for that service down quite substantially.\\n', 'Some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent.\\n', 'There are other services like how we make fertilizer,  or how we do air transport,  where the rooms for improvement are far, far less.\\n', \"And so, overall here, if we're optimistic,  we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even, perhaps, a factor of six.\\n\", \"But for these first three factors now,  we've gone from 26 billion to, at best, maybe 13 billion tons,  and that just won't cut it.\\n\", \"So let's look at this fourth factor --  this is going to be a key one --  and this is the amount of CO2 put out per each unit of energy.\\n\", 'And so the question is: Can you actually get that to zero?\\n', 'If you burn coal, no.\\n', 'If you burn natural gas, no.\\n', 'Almost every way we make electricity today,  except for the emerging renewables and nuclear, puts out CO2.\\n', \"And so, what we're going to have to do at a global scale,  is create a new system.\\n\", 'And so, we need energy miracles.\\n', 'Now, when I use the term \"miracle,\" I don\\'t mean something that\\'s impossible.\\n', 'The microprocessor is a miracle. The personal computer is a miracle.\\n', 'The Internet and its services are a miracle.\\n', 'So, the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles.\\n', \"Usually, we don't have a deadline,  where you have to get the miracle by a certain date.\\n\", \"Usually, you just kind of stand by, and some come along, some don't.\\n\", 'This is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed  and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline.\\n', 'Now, I thought, \"How could I really capture this?\\n', 'Is there some kind of natural illustration,  some demonstration that would grab people\\'s imagination here?\"\\n', 'I thought back to a year ago when I brought mosquitos,  and somehow people enjoyed that.\\n', 'It really got them involved in the idea of,  you know, there are people who live with mosquitos.\\n', 'So, with energy, all I could come up with is this.\\n', 'I decided that releasing fireflies  would be my contribution to the environment here this year.\\n', 'So here we have some natural fireflies.\\n', \"I'm told they don't bite; in fact, they might not even leave that jar.\\n\", \"Now, there's all sorts of gimmicky solutions like that one,  but they don't really add up to much.\\n\", \"We need solutions -- either one or several --  that have unbelievable scale  and unbelievable reliability,  and, although there's many directions people are seeking,  I really only see five that can achieve the big numbers.\\n\", \"I've left out tide, geothermal, fusion, biofuels.\\n\", \"Those may make some contribution,  and if they can do better than I expect, so much the better,  but my key point here  is that we're going to have to work on each of these five,  and we can't give up any of them because they look daunting,  because they all have significant challenges.\\n\", \"Let's look first at the burning fossil fuels,  either burning coal or burning natural gas.\\n\", \"What you need to do there, seems like it might be simple, but it's not,  and that's to take all the CO2, after you've burned it, going out the flue,  pressurize it, create a liquid, put it somewhere,  and hope it stays there.\\n\", 'Now we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level,  but getting up to that full percentage, that will be very tricky,  and agreeing on where these CO2 quantities should be put will be hard,  but the toughest one here is this long-term issue.\\n', \"Who's going to be sure?\\n\", \"Who's going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger  than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things?\\n\", 'This is a lot of volume.\\n', \"So that's a tough one.\\n\", 'Next would be nuclear.\\n', \"It also has three big problems:  Cost, particularly in highly regulated countries, is high;  the issue of the safety, really feeling good about nothing could go wrong,  that, even though you have these human operators,  that the fuel doesn't get used for weapons.\\n\", 'And then what do you do with the waste?\\n', \"And, although it's not very large, there are a lot of concerns about that.\\n\", 'People need to feel good about it.\\n', 'So three very tough problems that might be solvable,  and so, should be worked on.\\n', \"The last three of the five, I've grouped together.\\n\", 'These are what people often refer to as the renewable sources.\\n', \"And they actually -- although it's great they don't require fuel --  they have some disadvantages.\\n\", 'One is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies  is dramatically less than a power plant.\\n', \"This is energy farming, so you're talking about many square miles,  thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant.\\n\", 'Also, these are intermittent sources.\\n', \"The sun doesn't shine all day, it doesn't shine every day,  and, likewise, the wind doesn't blow all the time.\\n\", \"And so, if you depend on these sources,  you have to have some way of getting the energy  during those time periods that it's not available.\\n\", \"So, we've got big cost challenges here,  we have transmission challenges:  for example, say this energy source is outside your country;

facilitated construction  rather than getting in the way.', 'So I proposed  that governments create new reform zones  big enough to hold cities  and gave them a name: charter cities.', 'Later I learned that at about this same time,  Javier and Octavio  were thinking about the challenge of reform  in Honduras.', 'They knew that about 75,000 Hondurans every year  would leave to go to the United States,  and they wanted to ask, what could they do  to make sure that those people could stay  and do the same things in Honduras.', 'At one point, Javier said to Octavio,  \"What if we took some of our empty land --  what if we just gave it to an embassy --  give some to the U.S. embassy; give some to the Canadian embassy --  and then if people want to go work  under the rules of Canada or under the rules of the United States,  they can go get jobs,  do everything they do on those embassy grounds', 'that they would otherwise have to go to Canada or the U.S. to do?\"', 'In the summer of 2009,  Honduras went through a wrenching constitutional crisis.', 'At the next regularly scheduled election,  Pepe Lobo won in a landslide  on a platform that promised reform,  but reconciliation as well.', 'He asked Octavio to be his chief of staff.', 'Meanwhile, I was getting ready  to give a talk at TEDGlobal.', 'Through a process of refinement,  trial and error, a lot of user testing,  I tried to boil this complicated concept of charter city  down to the bare essentials.', \"The first point was the importance of rules,  like those rules that say  you can't come in and disturb all the existing apartment holders.\", \"We pay a lot of attention to new technologies,  but it takes technologies and rules to get progress,  and it's usually the rules that hold us back.\", 'In the fall of 2010, a friend from Guatemala  sent Octavio a link to the TEDTalk.', 'He showed it to Javier.', 'They called me.', 'They said, \"Let\\'s present this to the leaders of our country.\"', 'So in December we met in Miami,  in a hotel conference room.', 'I tried to explain this point  about how valuable cities are,  how much more valuable they are than they cost.', \"And I used this slide  showing how valuable the raw land is  in a place like New York City:  notice, land that's worth thousands of dollars, in some cases,  per square meter.\", 'But it was a fairly abstract discussion,  and at some point when there was a pause,  Octavio said,  \"Paul, maybe we could watch the TEDTalk.\"', 'So the TEDTalk laid out in very simple terms,  a charter city is a place  where you start with uninhabited land,  a charter that specifies the rules that will apply there  and then a chance for people to opt in,  to go live under those rules or not.', 'So I was asked by the president of Honduras who said that we need to do this project,  this could be the way forward for our country.', 'I was asked to come to Tegucigalpa  and talk again on January fourth and fifth.', 'So I presented  another fact-filled lecture  that included a slide like this,  which tried to make the point that, if you want to create a lot of value in a city,  it has to be very big.', 'This is a picture of Denver,  and the outline is the new airport that was built in Denver.', 'This airport alone  covers more than 100 square kilometers.', \"if you build a new city,  you've got to start with a site that's at least 1,000 square kilometers.\", \"That's more than 250 hundred-thousand acres.\", 'Everybody applauded politely.', 'The faces in the audience  were very serious and attentive.', 'The leader of the congress came up on stage and said,  \"Professor Romer, thank you very much for your lecture,  but maybe we could watch the TEDTalk.', 'I\\'ve got it here on my laptop.\"', 'So I sat down, and they played the TEDTalk.', 'And it got to the essence,  which is that a new city could offer new choices for people.', 'There would be a choice of a city which you could go to  instead of hundreds of miles away in the North.', 'And it also involved new choices for leaders.', 'Because the leaders in the government there in Honduras  would need help from partner countries,  who could benefit from partner countries  who help them set up the rules in this charter and the enforcement, so everybody can trust  that the charter really will be enforced.', 'And the insight of President Lobo  was that that assurance of enforcement  that I was thinking about  as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the city  could be equally important for all the different parties in Honduras  who had suffered for so many years  from fear and distrust.', 'We went and looked at a site.', \"This picture's from there.\", 'It easily could hold a thousand square kilometers.', 'And shortly thereafter, on January 19th,  they voted in the congress to amend their constitution  to have a constitutional provision  that allows for special development regions.', 'In a country which had just gone through this wrenching crisis,  the vote in the congress in favor of this constitutional amendment  was 124 to one.', 'All parties, all factions in society, backed this.', 'To be part of the constitution, you actually have to pass it twice in the congress.', 'On February 17th they passed it again  with another vote of 114 to one.', 'Immediately after that vote,  on February 21st to the 24th,  a delegation of about 30 Hondurans  that are most interested in getting into the city building business.', 'One is South Korea.', \"This is a picture of a big, new city center  that's being built in South Korea --  bigger than downtown Boston.\", 'Everything you see there was built in four years,  after they spent four years getting the permits.', \"The other place that's very interested in city building is Singapore.\", \"They've actually built two cities already in China  and are preparing the third.\", \"So if you think about this practically,  here's where we are.\", \"They've got a site; they're already thinking about this site for the second city.\", \"They're putting in place a legal system  that could allow for managers to come in,  and also an external legal system.\", 'One country has

bring with them some financing.', \"But the one thing you know they've already solved  is that there's lots of tenants.\", \"There's lots of businesses that would like to locate in the Americas,

'So what kind of an idea is it  to think about building a brand new city in Honduras?', 'Or to build a dozen of these,  or a hundred of these, around the world?', 'What kind of an idea is it  to think about insisting  that every family have a choice of several cities  that are competing to attract new residents?', 'This is an idea worth spreading.', '', 'I want you to imagine two couples  in the

the conception,  because if you spend all that time imagining that conception,  you're not going to listen to me.\", 'So just imagine that for a moment.', 'And in this scenario,  the sperm is carrying a Y chromosome,  meeting that X chromosome of the egg.', 'And in the other case,  the sperm is carrying an X chromosome,  meeting the X chromosome of the egg.', 'Both are viable; both take off.',

the way that people have dealt with anatomy --  meaning human bodies, animal bodies --  how they dealt with bodily fluids, concepts of bodies;  how have they thought about bodies.\", 'is as an activist,  as a patient advocate --  or, as I sometimes say, as an impatient advocate --  for people who are patients of doctors.', \"In that case, what I've worked with  is people who have body types  that challenge social norms.\", \"So some of what I've worked on, for example,  is people who are conjoined twins --  two people within one body.\", \"Some of what I've worked on is people who have dwarfism --  so people who are much shorter than typical.\", \"And a lot of what I've worked on  is people who have atypical sex --  so people who don't have the standard male  or the standard female body types.\", 'And as a general term, we can use the term intersex for this.', 'Intersex comes in a lot of different forms.', \"that isn't standard for male or female.\", 'So in one instance,  you can have somebody who has an XY chromosomal basis,  and that SRY gene on the Y chromosome  tells the proto-gonads, which we all have in the fetal life,  to become testes.', 'And so in the fetal life the testes are pumping out testosterone.', \"But because this individual lacks receptors  to hear that testosterone,  the body doesn't react to the testosterone.\", 'And this is a syndrome called androgen insensitivity syndrome.', 'So lots of levels of testosterone, but no reaction to it.', 'As a consequence, the body develops  more along the female typical path.', 'When the child is born, she looks like a girl.', 'She is a girl. She is raised as a girl.', \"And it's often not until she hits puberty  and she's growing and developing breasts,  but she's not getting her period,  that somebody figures out something's up here.\", 'And they do some tests and figure out  that, instead of having ovaries inside and a uterus,  she actually has testes inside, and she has a Y chromosome.', \"Now what's important to understand  is you may think of this person as really being male,  but they're really not.\", 'Females, like males,  have in our bodies something called the adrenal glands.', \"They're in the back of our body.\", 'And the adrenal glands make androgens,  which are a masculinizing hormone.', \"Most females like me -- I believe myself to be a typical female --  I don't actually know my chromosomal make-up  but I think I'm probably typical --  most females like me are actually androgen-sensitive.\", \"We're making androgen, and we're responding to androgens.\", 'has actually had a brain exposed to more androgens  than the woman born with testes  who has androgen insensitivity syndrome.', \"So sex is really complicated; it's not just that intersex people  in some ways, they can be all over the place.\", 'Another example:  a few years ago I got a call from a man who was 19 years old,  who was born a boy, raised a boy,  had a girlfriend, had sex with his girlfriend,  had a life as a guy  and had just found out that he had ovaries and a uterus inside.', 'What he had was an extreme form  of a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia.', 'He had XX chromosomes,  and in the womb,  his adrenal glands were in such high gear  that it created, essentially, a masculine hormonal environment.', 'And as a consequence, his genitals were masculinzed,  his brain was subject  to the more typical masculine component of hormones.', 'And he was born looking like a boy -- nobody suspected anything.', 'And it was only when he had reached the age of 19  that he began to have enough medical problems  actually from menstruating internally,  that doctors figured out that, in fact, he was female internally.', 'Okay, so just one more quick example  of a way you can have intersex.', 'Some people who have XX chromosomes  develop what are called ovotestis,  which is when you have ovarian tissue  with testicular tissue wrapped around it.', \"And we're not exactly sure why that happens.\", 'So sex can come in lots of different varieties.', \"that children with these kinds of bodies --  whether it's dwarfism, or it's conjoined twinning,  or it's an intersex type --  are often normalized by surgeons  is not because it actually leaves them better off  in terms of physical health.\", 'In many cases, people are actually perfectly healthy.', \"The reason they're often subject to various kinds of surgeries  is because they threaten our social categories.\", 'that a particular kind of anatomy comes with a particular identity.', 'So we have the concept that what it means to be a woman  is to have a female identity;  what it means to be a black person is, allegedly,  is to have an African anatomy  in terms of your history.', 'And so we have this terribly simplistic idea.', \"And when we're faced with a body  that actually presents us something quite different,  it startles us in terms of those categorizations.\", 'So we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture  about individualism.', \"And our nation's really founded on a very romantic concept of individualism.\", 'Well you can imagine how startling then it is  when you have children that are born  who are two people inside of one body.', 'Where I ran into the most heat from this most recently  was last year the South African runner, Caster Semenya,  had her sex called into question at the International Games in Berlin.', 'I had a lot of journalists calling me, asking me,  \"Which is the test they\\'re going to run  that will tell us whether or not  Caster Semenya is male or female?\"', \"And I had to explain to the journalists there isn't such a test.\", \"that sex is complicated enough  that we have to admit  nature doesn't draw the line for us between male and female,  or between male and intersex and female and intersex;  we actually draw that line on nature.\", 'So what we have is a sort of situation  where the farther our science goes,  the more we have to admit to ourselves  that these categories  that we thought of as stable anatomical categories  that mapped very simply  are a lot more fuzzy than we thought.', \"And it's not just in terms of sex.\", \"It's also in terms of race,  which turns out to be vastly more complicated  than our terminology has allowed.\", 'As we look, we get into all sorts of uncomfortable areas.', 'We look, for example, about the fact  that we share at least 95 percent of our DNA  with chimpanzees.', 'What are we to make of the fact  that we differ from them only really by a few nucleotides?', \"And as we get farther and farther with our science,  we get more and more into a discomforted zone  where we have to acknowledge  that the simplistic categories we've had  are probably overly simplistic.\", \"So we're seeing this  in all sorts of places in human life.\", 'in our culture today, in the United States today,  is battles over the beginning of life and the end of life.', 'We have difficult conversations  about at what point we decide a body becomes a human,  such that it has a different right than a fetal life.', \"We have very difficult conversations nowadays --  about the question of when somebody's dead.\", 'In the past, our ancestors never had to struggle so much  with this question of when somebody was dead.', \"At most, they'd stick a feather on somebody's nose,  and if it twitched, they didn't bury them yet.\", 'If it stopped twitching, you bury them.', 'But today, we have a situation  where we want to take vital organs out of beings  and give them to other beings.', \"And as a consequence,  we're stuck with having to struggle with this really difficult question  about who's dead,  and this leads us to a really difficult situation  where we don't have such simple categories as we've had before.\", 'Now you might think that all this breaking-down of categories  would make somebody like me really happy.', \"I'm a political progressive, I defend people with unusual bodies,  but I have to admit to you that it makes me nervous.\", 'Understanding that these categories  are really much more unstable than we thought makes me tense.', 'from the point of view of thinking about democracy.', \"So in order to tell you about that tension,  I have to first admit to you that I'm a huge fan of the Founding Fathers.\", 'I know they were racists, I know they were sexist,  but they were great.', 'I mean, they were so brave and so bold  and so radical in what they did  that I find myself watching that cheesy musical \"1776\" every few years,  and it\\'s not because of the music, which is totally forgettable.', \"It's because of what happened in 1776  with the Founding Fathers.\", 'The Founding Fathers were, for my point of view,  the original anatomical activists,  and this is why.', 'What they rejected was an anatomical concept  and replaced it with another one  that was radical and beautiful and held us for 200 years.', 'So as you all recall,  what our Founding Fathers were rejecting was a concept of monarchy,  and the monarchy was basically based  on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.', \"The monarchs of the old world  didn't have a concept of DNA,  but they did have a concept of birthright.\", 'They had a concept of blue blood.', 'They had the idea that the people who would be in political power  should be in political power  because of the blood being passed down  from grandfather to father to son and so forth.', 'The Founding Fathers rejected that idea,  and they replaced it with a new anatomical concept,  and that concept  was all men are created equal.', 'They leveled that playing field  and decided the anatomy that mattered  was the commonality of anatomy,  not the difference in anatomy,  and that was a really radical thing to do.', 'because they were part of an Enlightenment system  where two things were growing up together.', 'And that was democracy growing up,  but it was also science growing up at the same time.', \"And it's really clear, if you look at the history of the Founding Fathers,  a lot of them were very interested in science,  and they were interested in a concept  of a naturalistic world.\", 'They were moving away from supernatural explanations,  and they were rejecting things like a supernatural concept of power,  where it transmitted  because of a very vague concept of birthright.', 'They were moving towards a naturalistic concept.', \"And if you look, for example, in the Declaration of Independence,  they talk about nature and nature's God.\", \"They don't talk about God and God's nature.\", \"They're talking about the power of nature  to tell us who we are.\", 'So as part of that,  they were coming to us with a concept  that was about anatomical commonality.', 'the Civil Rights movement of the future.', \"They didn't think of it that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.\", 'So what happened years afterward?', 'What happened was women, for example,  who wanted the right to vote,  took the Founding Fathers\\' concept  of anatomical commonality being more important  than anatomical difference  and said, \"The fact that we have a uterus and ovaries  to mean that we shouldn\\'t have the right to vote,  the right to full citizenship,  the right to own property, etc., etc.\"', 'And women successfully argued that.', 'Next came the successful Civil Rights movement,  talking about, \"Ain\\'t I a woman?\"', 'on the marching lines of the Civil Rights movement  saying, \"I am a man.\"', 'Again, people of color  appealing to a commonality of anatomy over a difference of anatomy,  again, successfully.', 'We see the same thing with the disability rights movement.', 'The problem is, of course,  that, as we begin to look at all that commonality,  we have to begin to question  why we maintain certain divisions.', 'Now mind you, I want to maintain some divisions,  anatomically, in our culture.', \"For example, I don't want  to give a fish the same rights as a human.\", \"I don't want to say we give up entirely on anatomy.\", \"I don't want to say five-year-olds  should be allowed to consent to sex or consent to marry.\", 'So there are some anatomical divisions  that make sense to me and that I think we should retain.', 'and why do we retain them and do they have meaning.', \"So let's go back to those two beings  conceived at the beginning of this talk.\", 'We have two beings, both conceived  in the middle of 1979 on the exact same day.', \"Let's imagine one of them, Mary,  is born three months prematurely,  so she's born on June 1, 1980.\", \"Henry, by contrast, is born at term,  so he's born on March 1, 1980.\", 'Simply by virtue of the fact  that Mary was born prematurely three months,  she comes into all sorts of rights  three months earlier than Henry does --  the right to consent to sex,  the right to vote, the right to drink.', \"Henry has to wait for all of that,  not because he's actually any different in age, biologically,  except in terms of when he was born.\", 'We find other kinds of weirdness in terms of what their rights are.', \"Henry, by virtue of being assumed to be male --  although I haven't told you that he's the XY one --  by virtue of being assumed to be male  is now liable to be drafted,  which Mary does not need to worry about.\", 'Mary, meanwhile, cannot in all the states  have the same right that Henry has in all the states,  namely, the right to marry.', 'Henry can marry in every state a woman,  but Mary can only marry today in a few states a woman.', 'So we have these anatomical categories that persist  that are in many ways problematic and questionable.', \"And the question to me becomes:  What do we do,  in looking at anatomy,  that a democracy that's been based on anatomy  might start falling apart?\", \"I don't want to give up the science,  but at the same time it kind of feels sometimes  like the science is coming out from under us.\", 'So where do we go?', 'It seems like what happens in our culture  is a sort of pragmatic attitude:  \"Well, we have to draw the line somewhere,  so we will draw the line somewhere.\"', 'But a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position.', \"Texas has at one point decided  that what it means to marry a man  is to mean that you don't have a Y chromosome,  and what it means to marry a woman means you do have a Y chromosome.\", \"Now in practice they don't actually test people for their chromosomes.\", 'But this is also very bizarre,  because of the story I told you at the beginning  about androgen insensitivity syndrome.', 'If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy,  Dr. Martin Luther King,  he offers us something of a solution in his \"I have a dream\" speech.', 'He says we should judge people \"based not on the color of their skin,  moving beyond anatomy.', 'And I want to say, \"Yeah, that sounds like a really good idea.\"', 'But in practice, how do you do it?', 'How do you judge people based on the content of character?', \"I also want to point out  that I'm not sure that is how we should distribute rights in terms of humans,  because, I have to admit, that there are some golden retrievers I know  that are probably more deserving of social services  than some humans I know.\", 'I also want to say there are probably also some yellow Labradors that I know  that are more capable of informed, intelligent, mature decisions  about sexual relations than some 40-year-olds that I know.', 'So how do we operationalize  the question of content of character?', 'It turns out to be really difficult.', \"And part of me also wonders,  what if content of character  turns out to be something that's scannable in the future --  able to be seen with an fMRI?\", 'Do we really want to go there?', \"I'm not sure where we go.\", 'What I do know is that it seems to be really important  to think about the idea of the United States being in the lead  of thinking about this issue of democracy.', \"We've done a really good job struggling with democracy,  and I think we would do a good job in the future.\", \"We don't have a situation that Iran has, for example,  where a man who's sexually attracted to other men  is liable to be murdered,  unless he's willing to submit to a sex change,  in which case he's allowed to live.\", \"We don't have that kind of situation.\", 'a surgeon I talked to a few years ago  who had brought over a set of conjoined twins  in order to separate them, partly to make a name for himself.', 'But when I was on the phone with him,  asking why he was going to do this surgery --  this was a very high-risk surgery --  his answer was that, in this other nation,  these children were going to be treated very badly, and so he had to do this.', 'My response to him was, \"Well, have you considered political asylum  instead of a separation surgery?\"', 'The United States has offered tremendous possibility  for allowing people to be the way they are,  without having them have to be changed for the sake of the state.', 'So I think we have to be in the lead.', \"Well, just to close, I want to suggest to you  that I've been talking a lot about the fathers.\", 'And I want to think about the possibilities  of what democracy might look like, or might have looked like,  if we had more involved the mothers.', 'And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist,  and that is that I think that there may be  different kinds of insights  that can come from different kinds of anatomies,  particularly when we have people thinking in groups.', \"Now for years, because I've been interested in intersex,  I've also been interested in sex difference research.\", \"And one of the things that I've been really interested in  in terms of the way they think and operate in the world.\", 'And what we know from cross-cultural studies  is that females, on average --  not everyone, but on average --  are more inclined to be very attentive  to complex social relations  and to taking care of people  who are basically vulnerable within the group.', 'And so if we think about that,  we have an interesting situation on our hands.', 'Years ago, when I was in graduate school,  one of my graduate advisers who knew I was interested in feminism --  I considered myself a feminist, as I still do --  asked a really strange question.', 'He said, \"Tell me what\\'s feminine about feminism.\"', 'And I thought, \"Well that\\'s the dumbest question I\\'ve ever heard.', 'Feminism is all about undoing stereotypes about gender,  so there\\'s nothing feminine about feminism.\"', 'But the more I thought about his question,  the more I thought there might be something feminine about feminism.', 'That is to say, there might be something, on average, different about female brains from male brains  that makes us more attentive  to deeply complex social relationships  and more attentive to taking care of the vulnerable.', \"So whereas the fathers were extremely attentive  to figuring out how to protect individuals from the state,  it's possible that if we injected more mothers  into this concept,  what we would have is more of a concept  of, not just how to protect,  but how to care for each other.\", \"And maybe that's where we need to go in the future,  when we take democracy beyond anatomy,  is to think less about the individual body,  in terms of the identity,  and think more about those relationships.\", \"So that as we the people try to create a more perfect union,  we're thinking about what we do for each other.\", '', \"If I can leave you with one big idea today,  it's that the whole of the data in which we consume  is greater that the sum of the parts,  and instead of thinking about information overload,  we can use information so that patterns pop  and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible.\", \"So what we're looking at right here is a typical mortality chart  organized by age.\", \"This tool that I'm using here is a little experiment.\", \"It's called Pivot, and with Pivot what I can do  is I can choose to filter in one particular cause of deaths -- say, accidents.\",

step back out again  and then reorganize the data by cause of death,  seeing that circulatory diseases and cancer  are the usual suspects, but not for everyone.', 'If we go ahead and we filter by age --  say 40 years or less --  we see that accidents are actually  the greatest cause that people have to be worried about.', \"And if you drill into that, it's especially the case for men.\", 'So you get the idea  that viewing information, viewing data in this way,  is a lot like swimming  in a living information info-graphic.', 'And if we can do this for raw data,  why not do it for content as well?', 'So what we have right here  is the cover of every single Sports Illustrated ever produced.', \"It's all here; it's all on the web.\", 'You can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk.', 'With Pivot, you can drill into a decade.', 'You can drill into a particular year.', 'You can jump right into a specific issue.', \"So I'm looking at this; I see the athletes  that have appeared in this issue, the sports.\", \"I'm a Lance Armstrong fan, so I'll go ahead and I'll click on that,  which reveals, for me, all the issues  in which Lance Armstrong's been a part of.\", 'Now, if I want to just kind of take a peek at these,  \"Well, what about taking a look at all of cycling?\"', 'So I can step back, and expand on that.', 'And I see Greg LeMond now.', \"And so you get the idea that when you  navigate over information this way --  going narrower, broader,  backing in, backing out --  you're not searching, you're not browsing.\", \"You're doing something that's actually a little bit different.\", \"It's in between, and we think it changes  the way information can be used.\", \"So I want to extrapolate on this idea a bit  with something that's a little bit crazy.\", \"What we're done here is we've taken every single Wikipedia page  and we reduced it down to a little summary.\", 'So the summary consists of just a little synopsis  and an icon to indicate the topical area that it comes from.', \"I'm only showing the top 500  most popular Wikipedia pages right here.\", 'But even in this limited view,  we can do a lot of things.', 'Right away, we get a sense of what are the topical domains  that are most popular on Wikipedia.', \"I'm going to go ahead and select government.\", 'Now, having selected government,  I can now see that the Wikipedia categories  that most frequently correspond to that  are Time magazine People of the Year.', 'So this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within any one Wikipedia page.', \"It's only possible to see that insight  when you step back and look at all of them.\", 'Looking at one of these particular summaries,  I can then drill into the concept of  Time magazine Person of the Year,  bringing up all of them.', \"So looking at these people,  I can see that the majority come from government;  some have come from natural sciences;  some, fewer still, have come from business --  there's my boss --  and one has come from music.\", 'And interestingly enough,  Bono is also a TED Prize winner.', 'So we can go, jump, and take a look at all the TED Prize winners.', \"So you see,

pages with it --  and we bring that zoomable technology  to every single web page like this.\", 'So I can step back,  pop right back into a specific section.', 'Now the reason why this is important is because,  by virtue of just viewing web pages in this way,  I can look at my entire browsing history  in the exact same way.', \"So I can drill into what I've done  over specific time frames.\",

web page  and just launch them again.', \"It's one metaphor repurposed multiple times,  and in each case it makes the whole greater  than the sum of the parts with the data.\", 'So right now, in this

the source was a man,  an African-American man,  charming, rugged, homeless,  playing a violin that only had two strings.', \"And I'm telling a story that many of you know,  because Steve's columns

promising career was cut short  by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia.\", 'Nathaniel dropped out of Juilliard, he suffered a complete breakdown,  and 30 years later he was living homeless  on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles.', \"I encourage all of you to read Steve's book or to watch the movie  to understand not only the beautiful bond  that formed between these two men,  but how music helped shape that bond,  and ultimately was instrumental -- if you'll pardon the pun --  in helping Nathaniel get off the streets.\", 'I met Mr. Ayers in 2008,  two years ago, at

Beethoven's Fourth Symphony.\", 'And we got talking about music, and I got an email from Steve a few days later  saying that Nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me.', 'Now, I should mention that Nathaniel refuses treatment  because when he was treated it was with shock therapy  and Thorazine and handcuffs,  and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life.', 'But as a result now, he is prone to  these schizophrenic episodes,  the worst of which can manifest themselves as  him exploding  and then disappearing for days,  wandering the streets of Skid Row,  exposed to its horrors, with the torment of his own mind  unleashed upon him.', 'And Nathaniel was in such a state of agitation when we started our first lesson at Walt Disney Concert Hall --  he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes,  he was lost.', 'And he was talking about  invisible demons and smoke,  and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep.', 'And I was afraid,  not for myself, but I was afraid  that I was going to lose him,  that he was going to sink into one of his states,  and that I would ruin his relationship with the violin  if I started talking about scales  and arpeggios and other exciting forms of  didactic violin pedagogy.', 'So, I just started playing.', 'And I played the first movement of the Beethoven Violin Concerto.', \"And as I played,  I understood that there was a profound change  occurring in Nathaniel's eyes.\", 'It was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical,  a chemical reaction, for which my playing the music  was its catalyst.', \"And Nathaniel's manic rage  was transformed into understanding,  a quiet curiosity and grace.\", 'And in a miracle, he lifted his own violin  and he started playing, by ear,  certain snippets of violin concertos  which he then asked me to complete -- Mendelssohn,  Tchaikovsky, Sibelius.', \"And we started talking about music, from Bach  to Beethoven and Brahms, Bruckner, all the B's,  from Bartók, all the way up to Esa-Pekka Salonen.\", 'And I understood that he not only  had an encyclopedic knowledge of music,  but he related to this music at a personal level.', 'He spoke about it with the kind of passion

that had just come from walking the streets  of downtown Los Angeles  to the charming, erudite, brilliant, Juilliard-trained musician.', 'Music is medicine. Music changes us.', 'And for Nathaniel, music is sanity.', 'Because music allows him to take his thoughts  and delusions and shape them  through his imagination and his creativity,  into reality.', 'And that is an escape  from his tormented state.', 'And I understood that this was the very essence of art.', \"This was the very reason why we made music,  that we take something that exists within all of us  at our very fundamental core,  our emotions,  and through our artistic lens,  through our creativity, we're able to shape those emotions into reality.\", 'And the reality of that expression  reaches all of us  and moves us, inspires and unites us.', 'And for Nathaniel,  music brought him back into a fold of friends.', 'The redemptive power of music brought him back  into a family of musicians  that understood him,  that recognized his talents  and respected him.', \"And I will always make music with Nathaniel,  whether we're at Walt Disney Concert Hall  or on Skid Row, because he reminds me  why I became a musician.\", 'Thank you.', 'Bruno Giussani: Thank you.

will be happening online.', 'The second major group of attackers  that we are watching today  are not motivated by money.', \"They're motivated by something else --  motivated by protests,  motivated by an opinion,  motivated by the laughs.\", 'Groups like Anonymous  have risen up over the last 12 months  and have become a major player  in the field of online attacks.', 'So those are the three main attackers:  criminals who do it for the money,  doing it for the protest,  but then the last group are nation states,  governments doing the attacks.', 'And then we look at cases  like what happened in DigiNotar.', 'This is a prime example of what happens  when governments attack  against their own citizens.', 'DigiNotar is a Certificate Authority  from The Netherlands --  or actually, it was.', 'It was running into bankruptcy  last fall  because they were hacked into.', 'Somebody broke in  and they hacked it thoroughly.', 'And I asked last week  in a meeting with Dutch government

this?', 'Well DigiNotar is a C.A.', 'They sell certificates.', 'What do you do with certificates?', 'if you have a website that has https,  SSL encrypted services,  services like Gmail.', \"Now we all, or a big part of us,  use Gmail or one of their competitors,  but these services are especially popular  in totalitarian states  like Iran,  where dissidents  use foreign services like Gmail

they hack into a foreign C.A.', 'and issue rogue certificates.', 'And this is exactly what happened  with the case of DigiNotar.', 'What about Arab Spring  and things that have been happening, for example, in Egypt?', 'Well in Egypt,  the rioters looted the headquarters  of the Egyptian secret police  in April 2011,  and when they were looting the building they found lots of papers.', 'Among those papers,  was this binder entitled \"FINFISHER.\"', 'And within that binder were notes  from a company based in Germany  which had sold the Egyptian government  a set of tools  for intercepting

example, in Germany,  just a couple of weeks ago  the so-called State Trojan was found, which was a trojan  used by German government officials  to investigate their own citizens.', \"If you are a

occasion I asked myself,  well how come you never buy anything?', \"Here's their olive oil aisle.\", 'including those that were in a locked case  that came from thousand-year-old olive trees.', 'So I one day decided to pay a visit to the manager,  and I asked the manager,  \"Is this model of offering people all this choice really working?\"', 'And he pointed to the busloads of tourists  that would show up everyday,  with cameras ready usually.', 'We decided to do a little experiment,  and we picked jam for our experiment.', \"Here's their jam aisle.\", 'They had 348 different kinds of jam.',

which case  were people more likely to stop, sample some jam?', 'More people stopped when there were 24, about 60 percent,  than when there were six,  about 40 percent.', 'The next thing we looked at  is in which case were people more likely  to buy a jar of jam.', 'Now we see the opposite effect.', 'Of the people who stopped when there were 24,  only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam.', 'Of the people who stopped when there were six,  well now we saw that 30 percent of them  actually bought a jar of jam.', 'Now if you do the math,  people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam  if they encountered six  than if they encountered 24.', 'Now choosing not to buy a jar of jam  is probably good for us --  but it turns out that this choice overload problem affects us  even in very consequential decisions.', 'We choose not to choose,  even when it goes against our best self-interests.', 'So now for the topic of today: financial savings.', \"Now I'm going to describe to you a study I did with Gur Huberman, Emir Kamenica, Wei Jang  where we looked at the retirement savings decisions  of nearly a million Americans from about 650 plans  all in the U.S.\",

we found  was that indeed there was a correlation.', 'So in these plans, we had about 657 plans  that ranged from offering people  anywhere from two to 59 different fund offerings.', 'And what we found was that,  the more funds offered,  indeed, there was less participation rate.', 'So if you look at the extremes,  those plans that offered you two funds,  participation rates were around in the

mega-sensation, international bestseller thing.', \"The result of which is that everywhere I go now,  people treat me like I'm doomed.\", 'Seriously -- doomed, doomed!', 'Like, they come up to me now, all worried, and they say,  \"Aren\\'t you afraid you\\'re never going to be able to top that?', 'Aren\\'t you afraid you\\'re going to keep writing for your whole life  and you\\'re never again going to create a book  that anybody in the world cares about at all,  ever again?\"', \"So that's reassuring, you know.\", 'But it would be worse, except for that I happen to remember  that over 20 years ago, when I was a teenager,  when I first started telling people that I wanted to be a writer,  I was met with this same sort of fear-based reaction.', 'And people would say, \"Aren\\'t you afraid you\\'re never going to have any success?', \"Aren't you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you?\", \"Aren't you afraid that you're going to work your whole life at this craft  and nothing's ever going to come of it  and you're going to die on a scrap heap of broken dreams    Like that, you know.\", 'The answer -- the short answer to all those questions is, \"Yes.\"', \"Yes, I'm afraid of all those things.\", 'And I always have been.', \"And I'm afraid of many, many more things besides  that people can't even guess at,  like seaweed and other things that are scary.\", \"But, when it comes to writing,  the thing that I've been sort of thinking about lately, and wondering about lately,  You know, is it rational?\", 'Is it logical that anybody should be expected  to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do.', \"And what is it specifically about creative ventures  that seems to make us really nervous about each other's mental health  in a way that other careers kind of don't do, you know?\", \"Like my dad, for example, was a chemical engineer  and I don't recall once in his 40 years of chemical engineering  anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer, you know?\", '\"That chemical-engineering block, John, how\\'s it going?\"', \"It just didn't come up like that, you know?\", \"But to be fair, chemical engineers as a group  haven't really earned a reputation over the centuries    We writers, we kind of do have that reputation,  and not just writers, but creative people across all genres,  it seems, have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable.\", 'And all you have to do is look at the very grim death count  in the 20th century alone, of really magnificent creative minds  who died young and often at their own hands, you know?', \"And even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide  seem to be really undone by their gifts, you know.\", 'Norman Mailer, just before he died, last interview, he said,  \"Every one of my books has killed me a little more.\"', \"An extraordinary statement to make about your life's work.\", \"But we don't even blink when we hear somebody say this,  because we've heard that kind of stuff for so long  and somehow we've completely internalized and accepted collectively  this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked  and that artistry, in the end, will always ultimately lead to anguish.\", 'And the question that I want to ask everybody here today  is are you guys all cool with that idea?', 'Are you comfortable with that?', \"Because you look at it even from an inch away and, you know --  I'm not at all comfortable with that assumption.\", \"I think it's odious.\", \"And I also think it's dangerous,  and I don't want to see it perpetuated into the next century.\", \"I think it's better if we encourage our great creative minds to live.\", \"And I definitely know that, in my case -- in my situation --  it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path  of assumption,  particularly given the circumstance that I'm in right now in my career.\", \"Which is -- you know, like check it out,  I'm pretty young, I'm only about 40 years old.\", 'I still have maybe another four decades of work left in me.', \"And it's exceedingly likely that anything I write from this point forward  is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after  the freakish success of my last book, right?\", \"I should just put it bluntly, because we're all sort of friends here now --  it's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me.\", 'So Jesus, what a thought!', \"That's the kind of thought that could lead a person  to start drinking gin at nine o'clock in the morning,  and I don't want to go there.\", 'I would prefer to keep doing this work that I love.', 'And so, the question becomes, how?', 'And so, it seems to me, upon a lot of reflection,  that the way that I have to work now, in order to continue writing,  is that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construct, right?', 'I have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance  between me, as I am writing, and my very natural anxiety  about what the reaction to that writing is going to be, from now on.', \"And, as I've been looking, over the last year,  I've been sort of looking across time,  and I've been trying to find other societies  to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have  about how to help creative people  sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity.\", 'And that search has led me to ancient Greece and ancient Rome.', 'So stay with me, because it does circle around and back.', 'But, ancient Greece and ancient Rome --  people did not happen to believe that creativity  came from human beings back then, OK?', 'People believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit  that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source,  for distant and unknowable reasons.', 'The Greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity \"daemons.\"', 'Socrates, famously, believed that he had a daemon  who spoke wisdom to him from afar.', 'The Romans had the same idea,  but they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius.', 'Which is great, because the Romans did not actually think  that a genius was a particularly clever individual.', \"They believed that a genius was this, sort of magical divine entity,  who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist's studio,  kind of like Dobby the house elf,  and sort of invisibly assist the artist with their work  and would shape the outcome of that work.\", \"So brilliant -- there it is, right there, that distance that I'm talking about --  that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work.\", 'And everyone knew that this is how it functioned, right?', 'So the ancient artist was protected from certain things,  like, for example, too much narcissism, right?', \"If your work was brilliant, you couldn't take all the credit for it,  everybody knew that you had this disembodied genius who had helped you.\", 'If your work bombed, not entirely your fault, you know?', 'Everyone knew your genius was kind of lame.', 'And this is how people thought about creativity in the West for a really long time.', \"And then the Renaissance came and everything changed,  and we had this big idea, and the big idea was,  let's put the individual human being at the center of the universe  above all gods and mysteries,  and there's no more room for mystical creatures who take dictation from the divine.\", \"And it's the beginning of rational humanism,  and people started to believe that creativity  came completely from the self of the individual.\", 'And for the first time in history,  you start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius,  rather than having a genius.', 'And I got to tell you, I think that was a huge error.', 'You know, I think that allowing somebody, one mere person  to believe that he or she is like, the vessel,  of all divine, creative, unknowable, eternal mystery  is just a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile, human psyche.', \"It's like asking somebody to swallow the sun.\", 'It just completely warps and distorts egos,  and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance.', 'And I think the pressure of that  has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years.', 'And, if this is true,  and I think it is true,  the question becomes, what now?', 'Can we do this differently?', 'about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery.', 'Maybe not.', \"Maybe we can't just erase 500 years of rational humanistic thought  in one 18 minute speech.\", \"And there's probably people in this audience  who would raise really legitimate scientific suspicions  about the notion of, basically, fairies  who follow people around rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff.\", \"I'm not, probably, going to bring you all along with me on this.\", 'But the question that I kind of want to pose is --  you know, why not?', 'Why not think about it this way?', 'Because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard  in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness  of the creative process.', 'A process which, as anybody who has ever tried to make something --  which is to say basically everyone here ---  knows does not always behave rationally.', 'And, in fact, can sometimes feel downright paranormal.', \"I had this encounter recently where I met the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone,  who's now in her 90s, but she's been a poet her entire life  and she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virginia,  she would be out working in the fields,  and she said she would feel and hear a poem  coming at her from over the landscape.\", 'And she said it was like a thunderous train of air.', 'And it would come barreling down at her over the landscape.', 'And she felt it coming, because it would shake the earth under her feet.', 'She knew that she had only one thing to do at that point,  and that was to, in her words, \"run like hell.\"', 'And she would run like hell to the house  and she would be getting chased by this poem,  and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil  fast enough so that when it thundered through her, she could collect it  and grab it on the page.', 'And other times she wouldn\\'t be fast enough,  so she\\'d be running and running, and she wouldn\\'t get to the house  and the poem would barrel through her and she would miss it  and she said it would continue on across the landscape,  looking, as she put it \"for another poet.\"', 'And then there were these times --  this is the piece I never forgot --  she said that there were moments where she would almost miss it, right?', \"So, she's running to the house and she's looking for the paper  and the poem passes through her,  and she grabs a pencil just as it's going through her,  and then she said, it was like she would reach out with her other hand  and she would catch it.\", 'She would catch the poem by its tail,  and she would pull it backwards into her body  as she was transcribing on the page.', 'And in these instances, the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact  but backwards, from the last word to the first.', \"So when I heard that I was like -- that's uncanny,  that's exactly what my creative process is like.\", \"That's not at all what my creative process is -- I'm not the pipeline!\", \"I'm a mule, and the way that I have to work  is I have to get up at the same time every day,  and sweat and labor and barrel through it really awkwardly.\", 'But even I, in my mulishness,  even I have brushed up against that thing, at times.', 'And I would imagine that a lot of you have too.', 'You know, even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source  that I honestly cannot identify.', 'And what is that thing?', 'And how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds,  but, in fact, might actually keep us sane?', 'And for me, the best contemporary example that I have of how to do that  is the musician Tom Waits,  who I got to interview several years ago on a magazine assignment.', 'And we were talking about this,  and you know, Tom, for most of his life, he was pretty much the embodiment  of the tormented contemporary modern artist,  trying to control and manage and dominate  these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses  that were totally internalized.', 'But then he got older, he got calmer,  and one day he was driving down the freeway in Los Angeles,  and this is when it all changed for him.', \"And he's speeding along, and all of a sudden  he hears this little fragment of melody,  that comes into his head as inspiration often comes, elusive and tantalizing,  and he wants it, it's gorgeous,  and he longs for it, but he has no way to get it.\", \"He doesn't have a piece of paper, or a pencil, or a tape recorder.\", 'So he starts to feel all of that old anxiety start to rise in him  like, \"I\\'m going to lose this thing,  and I\\'ll be be haunted by this song forever.', 'I\\'m not good enough, and I can\\'t do it.\"', 'And instead of panicking, he just stopped.', 'He just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel.', 'He just looked up at the sky, and he said,  \"Excuse me, can you not see that I\\'m driving?\"', '\"Do I look like I can write down a song right now?', 'If you really want to exist, come back at a more opportune moment  when I can take care of you.', 'Otherwise, go bother somebody else today.', 'Go bother Leonard Cohen.\"', 'And his whole work process changed after that.', 'Not the work, the work was still oftentimes as dark as ever.', \"But the process, and the heavy anxiety around it  was released when he took the genie, the genius out of him  where it was causing nothing but trouble, and released it back where it came from,  and realized that this didn't have to be this internalized, tormented thing.\", 'It could be this peculiar, wondrous, bizarre collaboration,  kind of conversation between Tom and the strange, external thing  that was not quite Tom.', 'When I heard that story, it started to shift a little bit  the way that I worked too, and this idea already saved me once.', 'It saved me when I was in the middle of writing \"Eat, Pray, Love,\"  and I fell into one of those sort of pits of despair  that we all fall into when we\\'re working on something and it\\'s not coming  and you start to think this is going to be a disaster, the worst book ever written.', 'Not just bad, but the worst book ever written.', 'And I started to think I should just dump this project.', 'But then I remembered Tom talking to the open air  and I tried it.', 'So I just lifted my face up from the manuscript  and I directed my comments to an empty corner of the room.', 'And I said aloud, \"Listen you, thing,  you and I both know that if this book isn\\'t brilliant  that is not entirely my fault, right?', \"Because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this,  I don't have any more than this.\", \"If you want it to be better, you've got to show up and do your part of the deal.\", \"But if you don't do that, you know what, the hell with it.\", \"I'm going to keep writing anyway because that's my job.\", 'And I would please like the record to reflect today  that I showed up for my part of the job.\"', \"Because --    Because in the end it's like this, OK --  centuries ago in the deserts of North Africa,  people used to gather for these moonlight dances of sacred dance and music  that would go on for hours and hours, until dawn.\", 'They were always magnificent, because the dancers were professionals  and they were terrific, right?', 'But every once in a while, very rarely, something would happen,  and one of these performers would actually become transcendent.', \"And I know you know what I'm talking about,  because I know you've all seen, at some point in your life,  It was like time would stop,  and the dancer would sort of step through some kind of portal  and he wasn't doing anything different  but everything would align.\", 'And all of a sudden, he would no longer appear to be merely human.', 'He would be lit from within, and lit from below  and all lit up on fire with divinity.', 'And when this happened, back then,  people knew it for what it was, you know, they called it by its name.', 'They would put their hands together and they would start to chant,  \"Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God.\"', \"That's God, you know.\", 'Curious historical footnote:  when the Moors invaded southern Spain, they took this custom with them  and the pronunciation changed over the centuries  from \"Allah, Allah, Allah,\" to \"Olé, olé, olé,\"  which you still hear in bullfights and in flamenco dances.', 'In Spain, when a performer has done something impossible and magic,  \"Allah, olé, olé, Allah, magnificent, bravo,\"  incomprehensible, there it is -- a glimpse of God.', 'Which is great, because we need that.', \"But, the tricky bit comes the next morning,  for the dancer himself, when he wakes up and discovers  that it's Tuesday at 11 a.m., and he's no longer a glimpse of God.\", \"He's just an aging mortal with really bad knees,  and maybe he's never going to ascend to that height again.\", \"And maybe nobody will ever chant God's name again as he spins,  and what is he then to do with the rest of his life?\", 'This is hard.', 'This is one of the most painful reconciliations to make  in a creative life.', \"But maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of anguish  if you never happened to believe, in the first place,  that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you.\", \"But maybe if you just believed that they were on loan to you  from some unimaginable source for some exquisite portion of your life  to be passed along when you're finished, with somebody else.\", 'And, you know, if we think about it this way, it starts to change everything.', \"This is how I've started to think,  and this is certainly how I've been

computer worm  is actually quite simple.', \"We don't want Iran to get the bomb.\", 'Their major asset for developing nuclear weapons  is the Natanz uranium enrichment facility.', 'The gray boxes that you see,  these are real-time control systems.', 'Now if we manage to compromise these systems  that control drive speeds and valves,  we can actually cause a lot of problems  with the centrifuge.', \"The gray boxes don't run Windows software;  they are a completely different technology.\", 'But if we manage  to place a good Windows virus  on a notebook  that is used by a maintenance engineer  to configure this gray box,  then we are in business.', 'And this is the plot behind Stuxnet.', 'So we start with a Windows dropper.', 'The payload goes onto the gray box,  damages the centrifuge,  and the Iranian nuclear program is delayed --  mission accomplished.', \"That's easy, huh?\", 'I want to tell you how we found that out.', 'When we started our research on Stuxnet six months ago,  it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was.', \"The only thing that was known  is it's very, very complex on the Windows part, the dropper part,  used multiple zero-day vulnerabilities.\", 'And it seemed to want to do something  with these gray boxes, these real-time control systems.', 'So that got our attention,  and we started a lab project  where we infected our environment with Stuxnet  and checked this thing out.', 'And then some very funny things happened.', \"Stuxnet behaved like a lab rat  that didn't like our cheese --  sniffed, but didn't want to eat.\", \"Didn't make sense to me.\", 'And after we experimented with different flavors of cheese,  I realized, well, this is a directed attack.', \"It's completely directed.\", \"The dropper is prowling actively  on the gray box  if a specific configuration is found,  and even if the actual program code that it's trying to infect  is actually running on that target.\", 'And if not, Stuxnet does nothing.', 'So that really got my attention,  and we started to work on this  nearly around the clock,  because I thought, \"Well, we don\\'t know what the target is.', \"It could be, let's say for example,  a U.S. power plant,  or a chemical plant in Germany.\", 'So we better find out what the target is soon.\"', \"So we extracted and decompiled  the attack code,  and we discovered that it's structured in two digital bombs --  a smaller one and a bigger one.\", 'And we also saw that they are very professionally engineered  by people who obviously had all insider information.', 'They knew all the bits and bites  that they had to attack.', 'They probably even know the shoe size of the operator.', 'So they know everything.', 'And if you have heard that the dropper of Stuxnet  is complex and high-tech,  let me tell you this:  the payload is rocket science.', \"It's way above everything  that we have ever seen before.\", 'Here you see a sample of this actual attack code.', 'We are talking about --  around about 15,000 lines of code.', 'Looks pretty much like old-style assembly language.', 'And I want to tell you how we were able  to make sense out of this code.', 'So what we were looking for is, first of all, system function calls,  because we know what they do.', 'And then we were looking for timers and data structures  and trying to relate them to the real world --  to potential real world targets.', 'So we do need target theories  that we can prove or disprove.', \"In order to get target theories,  we remember  that it's definitely hardcore sabotage,  it must be a high-value target  and it is most likely located in Iran,  because that's where most of the infections had been reported.\", \"Now you don't find several thousand targets in that area.\", 'to the Bushehr nuclear power plant  and to the Natanz fuel enrichment plant.', 'So I told my assistant,  \"Get me a list of all centrifuge and power plant experts from our client base.\"', 'And I phoned them up and picked their brain  in an effort to match their expertise  with what we found in code and data.', 'And that worked pretty well.', 'So we were able to associate  the small digital warhead  with the rotor control.', 'The rotor is that moving part within the centrifuge,  that black object that you see.', 'And if you manipulate the speed of this rotor,  you are actually able to crack the rotor  and eventually even have the centrifuge explode.', 'What we also saw  is that the goal of the attack  was really to do it slowly and creepy --  obviously in an effort  to drive maintenance engineers crazy,  that they would not be able to figure this out quickly.', 'The big digital warhead -- we had a shot at this  by looking very closely  at data and data structures.', \"So for example, the number 164  really stands out in that code;  you can't overlook it.\", 'I started to research scientific literature  on how these centrifuges  are actually built in Natanz  and found they are structured  in what is called a cascade,  and each cascade holds 164 centrifuges.', 'So that made sense, that was a match.', 'And it even got better.', 'These centrifuges in Iran  are subdivided into 15, what is called, stages.', 'And guess what we found in the attack code?', 'An almost identical structure.', 'So again, that was a real good match.', 'And this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at.', \"Now don't get me wrong here, it didn't go like this.\", 'These results have been obtained  over several weeks of really hard labor.', 'And we often went into just a dead end  and had to recover.', 'Anyway, so we figured out  that both digital warheads  were actually aiming at one and the same target,  but from different angles.', 'The small warhead is taking one cascade,  and spinning up the rotors and slowing them down,  and the big warhead  is talking to six cascades  and manipulating valves.', 'So in all, we are very confident  that we have actually determined what the target is.', 'It is Natanz, and it is only Natanz.', \"So we don't have to worry  that other targets  might be hit by Stuxnet.\", \"Here's some very cool stuff that we saw --  really knocked my socks off.\", 'Down there is the gray box,  and on the top you see the centrifuges.', 'Now what this thing does  is it intercepts the input values from sensors --  so for example, from pressure sensors  and vibration sensors --  and it provides legitimate program code,  which is still running during the attack,  with fake input data.', 'And as a matter of fact, this fake input data  is actually prerecorded by Stuxnet.', \"So it's just like from the Hollywood movies  where during the heist,  the observation camera is fed with prerecorded video.\", \"That's cool, huh?\", 'The idea here is obviously  not only to fool the operators in the control room.', 'It actually is much more dangerous and aggressive.', 'The idea  is to circumvent a digital safety system.', 'We need digital safety systems  where a human operator could not act quick enough.', 'So for example, in a power plant,  when your big steam turbine gets too over speed,  you must open relief valves within a millisecond.', 'Obviously, this cannot be done by a human operator.', 'So this is where we need digital safety systems.', 'And when they are compromised,  then real bad things can happen.', 'Your plant can blow up.', 'And neither your operators nor your safety system will notice it.', \"That's scary.\", 'But it gets worse.', \"And this is very important, what I'm going to say.\", 'Think about this:  this attack is generic.', \"It doesn't have anything to do, in specifics,  with centrifuges,  with uranium enrichment.\", 'So it would work as well, for example,  in a power plant  or in an automobile factory.', 'It is generic.', \"And you don't have -- as an attacker --  you don't have to deliver this payload  by a USB stick,  as we saw it in the case of Stuxnet.\", 'You could also use conventional worm technology for spreading.', 'Just spread it as wide as possible.', 'And if you do that,  what you end up with  is a cyber weapon of mass destruction.', \"That's the consequence  that we have to face.\", 'So unfortunately,  the biggest number of targets for such attacks  are not in the Middle East.', \"They're in the United States and Europe and in Japan.\", 'So all of the green areas,  these are your target-rich environments.', 'We have to face the consequences,  and we better start to prepare right now.', 'Thanks.', \"Chris Anderson: I've got a question.\", \"Ralph, it's been quite widely reported  that people assume that Mossad  is the main entity behind this.\", 'Is that your opinion?', 'Ralph Langner: Okay, you really want to hear that?', 'Yeah. Okay.', 'My opinion is that the Mossad is involved,  but that the leading force is not Israel.', 'So the leading force behind that  is the cyber superpower.', \"There is only one,  and that's the

that magic had been replaced  by machinery.', 'And this made me really sad.', 'I found myself becoming a little bit of a technophobe.', 'I was terrified by this idea  that I would lose the ability  to enjoy and appreciate the sunset  without having my camera on me, without tweeting it to my friends.', 'And it felt like technology  should enable magic, not kill it.', 'When I was a little girl,  my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket watch.', 'And this piece of 50-year-old technology  became the most magical thing to me.', 'It became a gilded gateway  into a world full of pirates and

architecture will disappear,  like in this case.', 'You know, these days, you always get images during the winter,  when they take the roof down,  of people who have been there and said, \"They demolished the building.\"', \"No, they didn't demolish it, just when it goes down,  the architecture almost disappears.\", \"Here's the building working.\", 'You see the person puzzled about what was going on inside.', 'And here was myself trying not to get wet,  testing the sensors that open the water.', 'Well, I should tell you now what happened one night  when all of the sensors stopped working.', 'But actually that night, it was even more fun.', 'All the kids from Zaragoza came to the building,  because the way of engaging with the building became something different.', 'Not anymore

interesting,  because, as architects, as engineers, as designers,  we always think about how people will use the things we design.', \"But then reality's always unpredictable.\", \"And that's the

matter what your background,  the right to vote and run,  and most importantly to stipulate on political parties  the alternation of male and female candidates  vertically and horizontally in their lists,  creating the zipper list.\", 'Eventually, our initiative was adopted and successful.', 'Women won 17.5 percent of the National Congress  in the first elections ever in 52 years.', 'However, bit by bit, the euphoria of the elections,  and of the revolution as a whole,  was fading out --  for every day we were waking up to the news of violence.', 'One day we wake up to the news  of the desecration of ancient mosques and Sufi tombs.', 'On another day we wake up to the news  of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the consulate.', 'On another day we wake up to the news  of the assassination of army officers.', 'And every day, every day we wake up with the rule of the militias  and their continuous violations of human rights of prisoners  and their disrespect of the rule of law.', 'Our society, shaped by a revolutionary mindset,  became more polarized  and has driven away from the ideals and the principles --  freedom, dignity, social justice --  that we first held.', 'Intolerance, exclusion and revenge  became the icons of the [aftermath] of the revolution.', 'I am here today not at all to inspire you  with our success story of the zipper list and the elections.', \"I'm rather here today to confess  that we as a nation took the wrong choice, made the wrong decision.\", 'We did not prioritize right.', 'For elections did not bring peace and stability and security in Libya.', 'Did the zipper list and the alternation between female and male candidates  bring peace and national reconciliation?', \"No, it didn't.\", 'What is it, then?', 'Why does our society continue to be polarized and dominated  with selfish politics of dominance and exclusion, by both men and women?', 'Maybe what was missing was not the women only,  but the feminine values of compassion, mercy and inclusion.', 'Our society needs national dialogue and consensus-building  more than it needed the elections,  which only reinforced polarization and division.', 'Our society needs the qualitative representation of the feminine  more than it needs the numerical, quantitative representation of the feminine.', 'We need to stop acting as agents of rage and calling for days of rage.', 'We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.', 'We need to develop a feminine discourse  that not only honors but also implements  mercy instead of revenge, collaboration instead of competition,  inclusion instead of exclusion.', 'These are the ideals that a war-torn Libya  needs desperately in order to achieve peace.', 'For peace has an alchemy,  and this alchemy is about the intertwining, the alternation  between the feminine and masculine perspectives.', \"That's the real zipper.\", 'And we need to establish that existentially  before we do so sociopolitically.', 'According to a Quranic verse  \"Salam\" -- peace -- \"is the word of the all-merciful God, raheem.\"', 'In turn, the word \"raheem,\" which is known in all Abrahamic traditions,  has the same root in Arabic as the word \"rahem\" -- womb --  symbolizing the maternal feminine encompassing all humanity  from which the male and the female,  from which all tribes, all peoples, have emanated from.', 'And so just as the womb entirely envelopes the embryo, which grows within it,  the divine matrix of compassion nourishes the entire existence.', 'Thus we are told that \"My mercy encompasses all things.\"', 'Thus we are told that \"My mercy takes precedence over my anger.\"', 'May we all be granted a grace of mercy.', '', 'So, well, I do applied math,  and this is a peculiar problem  for anyone who does applied math, is that  we are like management consultants.', 'No one knows what the hell we do.', 'So I am going to give you some -- attempt today  to try and explain to you what I do.', 'So, dancing is one of the most human of activities.', 'We delight at ballet virtuosos and tap dancers  you will see later on.', 'Now, ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise  and a high level of skill,  and probably a level of initial suitability  that may well have a genetic component to it.', \"Now, sadly, neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease  gradually destroy this extraordinary ability,  as it is doing to my friend Jan Stripling, who was  a virtuoso ballet dancer in his time.\", 'So great progress and treatment has been made over the years.', \"However, there are 6.3 million people worldwide  who have the disease, and they have to live with  incurable weakness, tremor, rigidity  and the other symptoms that go along with the disease,  so what we need are objective tools  to detect the disease before it's too late.\", \"We need to be able to measure progression objectively,  and ultimately, the only way we're going to know  when we actually have a cure is when we have  an objective measure that can answer that for sure.\", \"But frustratingly, with Parkinson's disease  and other movement disorders, there are no biomarkers,  so there's no simple blood test that you can do,  and the best that we have is like  this 20-minute neurologist test.\", \"You have to go to the clinic to do it. It's very, very costly,  and that means that, outside the clinical trials,  it's just never done. It's never done.\", 'But what if patients could do this test at home?', 'Now, that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic,  and what if patients could do that test themselves, right?', 'No expensive staff time required.', \"Takes about $300, by the way,  in the neurologist's clinic to do it. So what I want to propose to you as an unconventional way  in which we can try to achieve this,  because, you see, in one sense, at least,  we are all virtuosos like my friend Jan Stripling.\", 'So here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds.', 'Now, this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds,  and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers,  because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs  have the genes for it. FoxP2, for example.', 'And like ballet, it takes an extraordinary level of training.', 'I mean, just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak.', \"From the sound, we can actually track  the vocal fold position as it vibrates,  and just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson's,  so too are the vocal organs.\", 'So on the bottom trace, you can see an example of  irregular vocal fold tremor.', 'We see all the same symptoms.', 'We see vocal tremor, weakness and rigidity.', 'The speech actually becomes quieter and more breathy  So these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle,  in some cases, but with any digital microphone,  and using precision voice analysis software  in combination with the latest in machine learning,  which is very advanced by now,  we can now quantify exactly where somebody lies  on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone.', \"So these voice-based tests, how do they stack up against  expert clinical tests? We'll, they're both non-invasive.\", \"The neurologist's test is non-invasive. They both use existing infrastructure.\", \"You don't have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it.\", \"And they're both accurate. Okay, but in addition,  voice-based tests are non-expert.\", 'That means they can be self-administered.', \"They're high-speed, take about 30 seconds at most.\", \"They're ultra-low cost, and we all know what happens.\", 'When something becomes ultra-low cost,  it becomes massively scalable.', 'So here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now.', 'We can reduce logistical difficulties with patients.', 'No need to go to the clinic for a routine checkup.', 'We can do high-frequency monitoring to get objective data.', 'We can perform low-cost mass recruitment for clinical trials,  and we can make population-scale screening  feasible for the first time.', \"We have the opportunity to start to search  for the early biomarkers of the disease before it's too late.\", \"So, taking the first steps towards this today,  we're launching the Parkinson's Voice Initiative.\", \"With Aculab and PatientsLikeMe, we're aiming  to record a very large number of voices worldwide  to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals.\", 'We have local numbers accessible to three quarters  of a billion people on the planet.', \"Anyone healthy or with Parkinson's can call in, cheaply,  and leave recordings, a few cents each,  and I'm really happy to announce that we've already hit  six percent of our target just in eight hours.\", \"Thank you.     Tom Rielly: So Max, by taking all these samples of,  let's say, 10,000 people,  you'll be able to tell who's healthy and who's not?\", 'What are you going to get out of those samples?', 'Max Little: Yeah. Yeah. So what will happen is that,  during the call you have to indicate whether or not  you have the disease or not, you see. TR: Right.', 'ML: You see, some people may not do it. They may not get through it.', \"But we'll get a very large sample of data that is collected  in different circumstances that matter because then  we are looking at ironing out the confounding factors,  and looking for the actual markers of the disease.\", \"TR: So you're 86 percent accurate right now?\", \"ML: It's much better than that.\", \"Actually, my student Thanasis, I have to plug him,  because he's done some fantastic work,  and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well,  which enables this project, and we're getting 99 percent accuracy.\", \"TR: Ninety-nine. Well, that's an improvement.\", \"So what that means is that people will be able to —  ML:   TR: People will be able to call in from their mobile phones  and do this test, and people with Parkinson's could call in,  record their voice, and then their doctor can check up  on their progress, see where they're doing in this course of the disease.\", 'ML: Absolutely.', 'TR: Thanks so much. Max Little, everybody.']\n"

But for one to still fail so spectacularly...that takes something special!\\\\nThe cashier took my friends\\'s order, then promptly ignored me. I had to force myself in front of a cashier who opened his register to wait on the person BEHIND me. I waited over five minutes for a gigantic order that included precisely one kid\\'s meal. After watching two people who ordered after me be handed their food, I asked where mine was. The manager started yelling at the cashiers for \\\\\"serving off their orders\\\\\" when they didn\\'t have their food. But neither cashier was anywhere near those controls, and the manager was the one serving food to customers and clearing the boards.\\\\nThe manager was rude when giving me my order. She didn\\'t make sure that I had everything ON MY RECEIPT, and never even had the decency to apologize that I felt I was getting poor service.\\\\nI\\'ve eaten at various McDonalds restaurants for over 30 years. I\\'ve worked at more than one location. I expect bad days, bad moods, and the occasional mistake. But I have yet to have a decent experience at this store. It will remain a place I avoid unless someone in my party needs to avoid illness from low blood sugar. Perhaps I should go back to the racially biased service of Steak n Shake instead!'}"
