Intelligence -- what is it?
If we take a look back at the history of how intelligence has been viewed, one seminal example has been Edsger Dijkstra's famous quote that "the question of whether a machine can think is about as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can swim."
Now, Edsger Dijkstra, when he wrote this, intended it as a criticism of the early pioneers of computer science, like Alan Turing.
However, if you take a look back and think about what have been the most empowering innovations that enabled us to build artificial machines that swim and artificial machines that [fly], you find that it was only through understanding the underlying physical mechanisms of swimming and flight that we were able to build these machines.
And so, several years ago, I undertook a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence.
Let's take a step back.
Let's first begin with a thought experiment.
Pretend that you're an alien race that doesn't know anything about Earth biology or Earth neuroscience or Earth intelligence, but you have amazing telescopes and you're able to watch the Earth, and you have amazingly long lives, so you're able to watch the Earth over millions, even billions of years.
And you observe a really strange effect.
You observe that, over the course of the millennia, Earth is continually bombarded with asteroids up until a point, and that at some point, corresponding roughly to our year, 2000 AD, asteroids that are on a collision course with the Earth that otherwise would have collided mysteriously get deflected or they detonate before they can hit the Earth.
Now of course, as earthlings, we know the reason would be that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to prevent an impact.
But if you're an alien race who doesn't know any of this, doesn't have any concept of Earth intelligence, you'd be forced to put together a physical theory that explains how, up until a certain point in time, asteroids that would demolish the surface of a planet mysteriously stop doing that.
And so I claim that this is the same question as understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I undertook several years ago, I looked at a variety of different threads across science, across a variety of disciplines, that were pointing, I think, towards a single, underlying mechanism for intelligence.
And so, taking all of these different threads and putting them together, I asked, starting several years ago, is there an underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can factor out of all of these different threads?
Is there a single equation for intelligence?
And the answer, I believe, is yes. ["F = T ∇ Sτ"] What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to an E = mc² for intelligence that I've seen.
So what you're seeing here is a statement of correspondence that intelligence is a force, F, that acts so as to maximize future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize future freedom of action, or keep options open, with some strength T, with the diversity of possible accessible futures, S, up to some future time horizon, tau.
In short, intelligence doesn't like to get trapped.
Intelligence tries to maximize future freedom of action and keep options open.
And so, given this one equation, it's natural to ask, so what can you do with this?
How predictive is it?
Does it predict human-level intelligence?
Does it predict artificial intelligence?
So I'm going to show you now a video that will, I think, demonstrate some of the amazing applications of just this single equation.
But what if that tentative cosmological connection between entropy and intelligence hints at a deeper relationship?
What if intelligent behavior doesn't just correlate with the production of long-term entropy, but actually emerges directly from it?
To find out, we developed a software engine called Entropica, designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy of any system that it finds itself in.
Amazingly, Entropica was able to pass multiple animal intelligence tests, play human games, and even earn money trading stocks, all without being instructed to do so.
Here are some examples of Entropica in action.
Just like a human standing upright without falling over, here we see Entropica automatically balancing a pole using a cart.
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave Entropica a goal.
It simply decided on its own to balance the pole.
This balancing ability will have appliactions for humanoid robotics and human assistive technologies.
Just as some animals can use objects in their environments as tools to reach into narrow spaces, here we see that Entropica, again on its own initiative, was able to move a large disk representing an animal around so as to cause a small disk, representing a tool, to reach into a confined space holding a third disk and release the third disk from its initially fixed position.
This tool use ability will have applications for smart manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just as some other animals are able to cooperate by pulling opposite ends of a rope at the same time to release food, here we see that Entropica is able to accomplish a model version of that task.
This cooperative ability has interesting implications for economic planning and a variety of other fields.
Entropica is broadly applicable to a variety of domains.
For example, here we see it successfully playing a game of pong against itself, illustrating its potential for gaming.
Here we see Entropica orchestrating new connections on a social network where friends are constantly falling out of touch and successfully keeping the network well connected.
This same network orchestration ability also has applications in health care, energy, and intelligence.
Here we see Entropica directing the paths of a fleet of ships, successfully discovering and utilizing the Panama Canal to globally extend its reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
By the same token, Entropica is broadly applicable to problems in autonomous defense, logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see Entropica spontaneously discovering and executing a buy-low, sell-high strategy on a simulated range traded stock, successfully growing assets under management exponentially.
This risk management ability will have broad applications in finance and insurance.
Alex Wissner-Gross: So what you've just seen is that a variety of signature human intelligent cognitive behaviors such as tool use and walking upright and social cooperation all follow from a single equation, which drives a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, there's a profound irony here.
Going back to the beginning of the usage of the term robot, the play "RUR," there was always a concept that if we developed machine intelligence, there would be a cybernetic revolt.
The machines would rise up against us.
One major consequence of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had the whole concept of cybernetic revolt in reverse.
It's not that machines first become intelligent and then megalomaniacal and try to take over the world.
Another important consequence is goal seeking.
I'm often asked, how does the ability to seek goals follow from this sort of framework?
Finally, Richard Feynman, famous physicist, once wrote that if human civilization were destroyed and you could pass only a single concept on to our descendants to help them rebuild civilization, that concept should be that all matter around us is made out of tiny elements that attract each other when they're far apart but repel each other when they're close together.
My equivalent of that statement to pass on to descendants to help them build artificial intelligences or to help them understand human intelligence, is the following: Intelligence should be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize future freedom of action and avoid constraints in its own future.
Thank you very much.
Today I'm going to speak to you about the last 30 years of architectural history.
That's a lot to pack into 18 minutes.
It's a complex topic, so we're just going to dive right in at a complex place: New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from Jersey, and I was six, and I lived there in my parents' house in a town called Livingston, and this was my childhood bedroom.
Around the corner from my bedroom was the bathroom that I used to share with my sister.
And in between my bedroom and the bathroom was a balcony that overlooked the family room.
And that's where everyone would hang out and watch TV, so that every time that I walked from my bedroom to the bathroom, everyone would see me, and every time I took a shower and would come back in a towel, everyone would see me.
And I looked like this.
I was awkward, insecure, and I hated it.
I hated that walk, I hated that balcony, I hated that room, and I hated that house.
And that's architecture.
That feeling, those emotions that I felt, that's the power of architecture, because architecture is not about math and it's not about zoning, it's about those visceral, emotional connections that we feel to the places that we occupy.
And it's no surprise that we feel that way, because according to the EPA, Americans spend 90 percent of their time indoors.
That's 90 percent of our time surrounded by architecture.
That's huge.
That means that architecture is shaping us in ways that we didn't even realize.
That makes us a little bit gullible and very, very predictable.
It means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you think: You think "power" and "stability" and "democracy."
And I know you think that because it's based on a building that was build 2,500 years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
This is a trigger that architects use to get you to create an emotional connection to the forms that we build our buildings out of.
It's a predictable emotional connection, and we've been using this trick for a long, long time.
We used it [200] years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century in America, we used it to build houses.
And look at these solid, stable little soldiers facing the ocean and keeping away the elements.
This is really, really useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time, and it's very complicated.
And the people that build things -- developers and governments -- they're naturally afraid of innovation, and they'd rather just use those forms that they know you'll respond to.
That's how we end up with buildings like this.
This is a nice building.
But it doesn't have much to do with what a library actually does today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, another library was completed, and it looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library is about how we consume media in a digital age.
It's about a new kind of public amenity for the city, a place to gather and read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both called libraries, look so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works on the principle of a pendulum.
On the one side is innovation, and architects are constantly pushing, pushing for new technologies, new typologies, new solutions for the way that we live today.
We wear all black, we get very depressed, you think we're adorable, we're dead inside because we've got no choice.
We have to go to the other side and reengage those symbols that we know you love.
So we do that, and you're happy, we feel like sellouts, so we start experimenting again and we push the pendulum back and back and forth and back and forth we've gone for the last 300 years, and certainly for the last 30 years.
Okay, 30 years ago we were coming out of the '70s.
Architects had been busy experimenting with something called brutalism.
It's about concrete.
Small windows, dehumanizing scale.
This is really tough stuff.
So as we get closer to the '80s, we start to reengage those symbols.
We push the pendulum back into the other direction.
We take these forms that we know you love and we update them.
We add neon and we add pastels and we use new materials.
And you love it.
And we can't give you enough of it.
We take Chippendale armoires and we turned those into skyscrapers, and skyscrapers can be medieval castles made out of glass.
Forms got big, forms got bold and colorful.
Dwarves became columns.
It was crazy.
But it's the '80s, it's cool.
This is the thing about postmodernism.
This is the thing about symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of making places, we're making memories of places.
Because I know, and I know all of you know, this isn't Tuscany.
This is Ohio.
In the late '80s and early '90s, we start experimenting with something called deconstructivism.
We throw out historical symbols, we rely on new, computer-aided design techniques, and we come up with new compositions, forms crashing into forms.
This is academic and heady stuff, it's super unpopular, we totally alienate you.
Ordinarily, the pendulum would just swing back into the other direction.
And then, something amazing happened.
In 1997, this building opened.
This is the Guggenheim Bilbao, by Frank Gehry.
And this building fundamentally changes the world's relationship to architecture.
Paul Goldberger said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critics, academics, and the general public were completely united around a building.
The New York Times called this building a miracle.
Tourism in Bilbao increased 2,500 percent after this building was completed.
He is our very first starchitect.
Now, how is it possible that these forms -- they're wild and radical -- how is it possible that they become so ubiquitous throughout the world?
And it happened because media so successfully galvanized around them that they quickly taught us that these forms mean culture and tourism.
We created an emotional reaction to these forms.
So did every mayor in the world.
So every mayor knew that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon at the turn of the new millennium happened to a few other starchitects.
Because think about how you consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, you would have had to have walked to the village next door to see a building.
Transportation speeds up: You can take a boat, you can take a plane, you can be a tourist.
Technology speeds up: You can see it in a newspaper, on TV, until finally, we are all architectural photographers, and the building has become disembodied from the site.
Architecture is everywhere now, and that means that the speed of communication has finally caught up to the speed of architecture.
Because architecture actually moves quite quickly.
It doesn't take long to think about a building.
It takes a long time to build a building, three or four years, and in the interim, an architect will design two or eight or a hundred other buildings before they know if that building that they designed four years ago was a success or not.
That's because there's never been a good feedback loop in architecture.
That's how we end up with buildings like this.
It's never going to happen again, I think, because we are living on the verge of the greatest revolution in architecture since the invention of concrete, of steel, or of the elevator, and it's a media revolution.
So my theory is that when you apply media to this pendulum, it starts swinging faster and faster, until it's at both extremes nearly simultaneously, and that effectively blurs the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you, the public.
Now we can make nearly instantaneous, emotionally charged symbols out of something that's brand new.
Let me show you how this plays out in a project that my firm recently completed.
We were hired to replace this building, which burned down.
This is the center of a town called the Pines in Fire Island in New York State.
It's a vacation community.
We proposed a building that was audacious, that was different than any of the forms that the community was used to, and we were scared and our client was scared and the community was scared, so we created a series of photorealistic renderings that we put onto Facebook and we put onto Instagram, and we let people start to do what they do: share it, comment, like it, hate it.
But that meant that two years before the building was complete, it was already a part of the community, so that when the renderings looked exactly like the finished product, there were no surprises.
This building was already a part of this community, and then that first summer, when people started arriving and sharing the building on social media, the building ceased to be just an edifice and it became media, because these, these are not just pictures of a building, they're your pictures of a building.
That means we don't need the Greeks anymore to tell us what to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media hasn't just changed the relationship between all of us, it's changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think for a second about those librarians back in Livingston.
If that building was going to be built today, the first thing they would do is go online and search "new libraries."
They would be bombarded by examples of experimentation, of innovation, of pushing at the envelope of what a library can be.
That's ammunition.
That's ammunition that they can take with them to the mayor of Livingston, to the people of Livingston, and say, there's no one answer to what a library is today.
Let's be a part of this.
This abundance of experimentation gives them the freedom to run their own experiment.
Everything is different now.
Architects are no longer these mysterious creatures that use big words and complicated drawings, and you aren't the hapless public, the consumer that won't accept anything that they haven't seen anymore.
Architects can hear you, and you're not intimidated by architecture.
This is the end of architectural history, and it means that the buildings of tomorrow are going to look a lot different than the buildings of today.
It means that a public space in the ancient city of Seville can be unique and tailored to the way that a modern city works.
It means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be a stadium in Brooklyn, not some red-brick historical pastiche of what we think a stadium ought to be.
It means that robots are going to build our buildings, because we're finally ready for the forms that they're going to produce.
And it means that buildings will twist to the whims of nature instead of the other way around.
It means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida, can also be a place for sports and for yoga and you can even get married there late at night.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little reindeer pavilion that's as muscly and sinewy as the animals it's designed to observe.
And it means that a building doesn't have to be beautiful to be lovable, like this ugly little building in Spain, where the architects dug a hole, packed it with hay, and then poured concrete around it, and when the concrete dried, they invited someone to come and clean that hay out so that all that's left when it's done is this hideous little room that's filled with the imprints and scratches of how that place was made, and that becomes the most sublime place to watch a Spanish sunset.
Because it doesn't matter if a cow builds our buildings or a robot builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we build, it matters what we build.
Architects already know how to make buildings that are greener and smarter and friendlier.
We've just been waiting for all of you to want them.
And finally, we're not on opposite sides anymore.
Find an architect, hire an architect, work with us to design better buildings, better cities, and a better world, because the stakes are high.
Buildings don't just reflect our society, they shape our society down to the smallest spaces: the local libraries, the homes where we raise our children, and the walk that they take from the bedroom to the bathroom.
Thank you.
I think we all have closets.
Your closet may be telling someone you love her for the first time, or telling someone that you're pregnant, or telling someone you have cancer, or any of the other hard conversations we have throughout our lives.
All a closet is is a hard conversation, and although our topics may vary tremendously, the experience of being in and coming out of the closet is universal.
It is scary, and we hate it, and it needs to be done.
Several years ago, I was working at the South Side Walnut Cafe, a local diner in town, and during my time there I would go through phases of militant lesbian intensity: not shaving my armpits, quoting Ani DiFranco lyrics as gospel.
And depending on the bagginess of my cargo shorts and how recently I had shaved my head, the question would often be sprung on me, usually by a little kid: "Um, are you a boy or are you a girl?"
And there would be an awkward silence at the table.
I'd clench my jaw a little tighter, hold my coffee pot with a little more vengeance.
The dad would awkwardly shuffle his newspaper and the mom would shoot a chilling stare at her kid.
But I would say nothing, and I would seethe inside.
So I promised myself, the next time, I would say something.
I would have that hard conversation.
So within a matter of weeks, it happens again.
"Are you a boy or are you a girl?"
I've got my Gloria Steinem quotes.
I've even got this little bit from "Vagina Monologues" I'm going to do.
So I take a deep breath and I look down and staring back at me is a four-year-old girl in a pink dress, not a challenge to a feminist duel, just a kid with a question: "Are you a boy or are you a girl?"
So I take another deep breath, squat down to next to her, and say, "Hey, I know it's kind of confusing.
My hair is short like a boy's, and I wear boy's clothes, but I'm a girl, and you know how sometimes you like to wear a pink dress, and sometimes you like to wear your comfy jammies?
Well, I'm more of a comfy jammies kind of girl."
And this kid looks me dead in the eye, without missing a beat, and says, "My favorite pajamas are purple with fish.
Can I get a pancake, please?"
How about that pancake?"
It was the easiest hard conversation I have ever had.
And why? Because Pancake Girl and I, we were both real with each other.
So like many of us, I've lived in a few closets in my life, and yeah, most often, my walls happened to be rainbow.
But inside, in the dark, you can't tell what color the walls are.
You just know what it feels like to live in a closet.
So really, my closet is no different than yours or yours or yours.
Sure, I'll give you 100 reasons why coming out of my closet was harder than coming out of yours, but here's the thing: Hard is not relative.
Hard is hard.
Who can tell me that explaining to someone you've just declared bankruptcy is harder than telling someone you just cheated on them?
Who can tell me that his coming out story is harder than telling your five-year-old you're getting a divorce?
There is no harder, there is just hard.
We need to stop ranking our hard against everyone else's hard to make us feel better or worse about our closets and just commiserate on the fact that we all have hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in closets, and they may feel safe, or at least safer than what lies on the other side of that door.
But I am here to tell you, no matter what your walls are made of, a closet is no place for a person to live.
Me, I had a ponytail, a strapless dress, and high-heeled shoes.
I was not the militant lesbian ready to fight any four-year-old that walked into the cafe.
I was frozen by fear, curled up in the corner of my pitch-black closet clutching my gay grenade, and moving one muscle is the scariest thing I have ever done.
My family, my friends, complete strangers -- I had spent my entire life trying to not disappoint these people, and now I was turning the world upside down on purpose.
I was burning the pages of the script we had all followed for so long, but if you do not throw that grenade, it will kill you.
One of my most memorable grenade tosses was at my sister's wedding.
And after a little small talk, one of the women shouted out, "I love Nathan Lane!"
And the battle of gay relatability had begun.
"Ash, have you ever been to the Castro?"
"Well, yeah, actually, we have friends in San Francisco."
"Well, we've never been there but we've heard it's fabulous."
"Ash, do you know my hairdresser Antonio?
He's really good and he has never talked about a girlfriend."
"Ash, what's your favorite TV show?
Our favorite TV show? Favorite: Will & Grace.
And you know who we love? Jack.
Jack is our favorite."
And then one woman, stumped but wanting so desperately to show her support, to let me know she was on my side, she finally blurted out, "Well, sometimes my husband wears pink shirts."
I could go back to my girlfriend and my gay-loving table and mock their responses, chastise their unworldliness and their inability to jump through the politically correct gay hoops I had brought with me, or I could empathize with them and realize that that was maybe one of the hardest things they had ever done, that starting and having that conversation was them coming out of their closets.
Sure, it would have been easy to point out where they felt short.
It's a lot harder to meet them where they are and acknowledge the fact that they were trying.
And what else can you ask someone to do but try?
If you're going to be real with someone, you gotta be ready for real in return.
So hard conversations are still not my strong suit.
Ask anybody I have ever dated.
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three Pancake Girl principles.
Now, please view this through gay-colored lenses, but know what it takes to come out of any closet is essentially the same.
Number one: Be authentic.
Take the armor off. Be yourself.
That kid in the cafe had no armor, but I was ready for battle.
If you want someone to be real with you, they need to know that you bleed too.
Number two: Be direct. Just say it. Rip the Band-Aid off.
If you know you are gay, just say it.
If you tell your parents you might be gay, they will hold out hope that this will change.
Do not give them that sense of false hope.
You are speaking your truth.
Never apologize for that.
And some folks may have gotten hurt along the way, so sure, apologize for what you've done, but never apologize for who you are.
And yeah, some folks may be disappointed, but that is on them, not on you.
Those are their expectations of who you are, not yours.
That is their story, not yours.
The only story that matters is the one that you want to write.
So the next time you find yourself in a pitch-black closet clutching your grenade, know we have all been there before.
And you may feel so very alone, but you are not.
And we know it's hard but we need you out here, no matter what your walls are made of, because I guarantee you there are others peering through the keyholes of their closets looking for the next brave soul to bust a door open, so be that person and show the world that we are bigger than our closets and that a closet is no place for a person to truly live.
I had brain surgery 18 years ago, and since that time, brain science has become a personal passion of mine.
I'm actually an engineer.
So that said, there's a stigma when you have brain surgery.
Are you still smart or not?
And if not, can you make yourself smart again?
Immediately after my surgery, I had to decide what amounts of each of over a dozen powerful chemicals to take each day, because if I just took nothing, I would die within hours.
There have been several close calls.
But luckily, I'm an experimentalist at heart, so I decided I would experiment to try to find more optimal dosages because there really isn't a clear road map on this that's detailed.
I began to try different mixtures, and I was blown away by how tiny changes in dosages dramatically changed my sense of self, my sense of who I was, my thinking, my behavior towards people.
One particularly dramatic case: for a couple months I actually tried dosages and chemicals typical of a man in his early 20s, and I was blown away by how my thoughts changed.
I was kind of extreme.
But to me, the surprise was, I wasn't trying to be arrogant.
I was actually trying, with a little bit of insecurity, to actually fix a problem in front of me, and it just didn't come out that way.
But that experience, I think, gave me a new appreciation for men and what they might walk through, and I've gotten along with men a lot better since then.
What I was trying to do with tuning these hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth was to try to get my intelligence back after my illness and surgery, my creative thought, my idea flow.
And I think mostly in images, and so for me that became a key metric -- how to get these mental images that I use as a way of rapid prototyping, if you will, my ideas, trying on different new ideas for size, playing out scenarios.
This kind of thinking isn't new.
Philiosophers like Hume and Descartes and Hobbes saw things similarly.
They thought that mental images and ideas were actually the same thing.
There are those today that dispute that, and lots of debates about how the mind works, but for me it's simple: Mental images, for most of us, are central in inventive and creative thinking.
So after several years, I tuned myself up and I have lots of great, really vivid mental images with a lot of sophistication and the analytical backbone behind them.
And so now I'm working on, how can I get these mental images in my mind out to my computer screen faster?
Can you imagine, if you will, a movie director being able to use her imagination alone to direct the world in front of her?
Or a musician to get the music out of his head?
There are incredible possibilities with this as a way for creative people to share at light speed.
So let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting there by sharing with you two recent experiments from two top neuroscience groups.
Both used fMRI technology -- functional magnetic resonance imaging technology -- to image the brain, and here is a brain scan set from Giorgio Ganis and his colleagues at Harvard.
And the left-hand column shows a brain scan of a person looking at an image.
The middle column shows the brainscan of that same individual imagining, seeing that same image.
And the right column was created by subtracting the middle column from the left column, showing the difference to be nearly zero.
This was repeated on lots of different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar result.
The difference between seeing an image and imagining seeing that same image is next to nothing.
Next let me share with you one other experiment, this from Jack Gallant's lab at Cal Berkeley.
In this experiment, individuals were shown hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while scans were made of their brains to create a large library of their brain reacting to video sequences.
Then a new movie was shown with new images, new people, new animals in it, and a new scan set was recorded.
The computer, using brain scan data alone, decoded that new brain scan to show what it thought the individual was actually seeing.
On the right-hand side, you see the computer's guess, and on the left-hand side, the presented clip.
This is the jaw-dropper.
We are so close to being able to do this.
We just need to up the resolution.
And now remember that when you see an image versus when you imagine that same image, it creates the same brain scan.
So this was done with the highest-resolution brain scan systems available today, and their resolution has increased really about a thousandfold in the last several years.
Next we need to increase the resolution another thousandfold to get a deeper glimpse.
How do we do that?
There's a lot of techniques in this approach.
One way is to crack open your skull and put in electrodes.
I'm not for that.
There's a lot of new imaging techniques being proposed, some even by me, but given the recent success of MRI, first we need to ask the question, is it the end of the road with this technology?
Conventional wisdom says the only way to get higher resolution is with bigger magnets, but at this point bigger magnets only offer incremental resolution improvements, not the thousandfold we need.
I'm putting forward an idea: instead of bigger magnets, let's make better magnets.
We can create much more complicated structures with slightly different arrangements, kind of like making Spirograph.
So why does that matter?
A lot of effort in MRI over the years has gone into making really big, really huge magnets, right?
But yet most of the recent advances in resolution have actually come from ingeniously clever encoding and decoding solutions in the F.M. radio frequency transmitters and receivers in the MRI systems.
Let's also, instead of a uniform magnetic field, put down structured magnetic patterns in addition to the F.M. radio frequencies.
So by combining the magnetics patterns with the patterns in the F.M. radio frequencies processing which can massively increase the information that we can extract in a single scan.
And using fMRI, we should be able to measure not just oxygenated blood flow, but the hormones and neurotransmitters I've talked about and maybe even the direct neural activity, which is the dream.
We're going to be able to dump our ideas directly to digital media.
Could you imagine if we could leapfrog language and communicate directly with human thought?
What would we be capable of then?
And how will we learn to deal with the truths of unfiltered human thought?
You think the Internet was big.
These are huge questions.
It might be irresistible as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication skills.
And indeed, this very same tool may prove to lead to the cure for Alzheimer's and similar diseases.
We have little option but to open this door.
It's hard to imagine it taking much longer.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
In many patriarchal societies and tribal societies, fathers are usually known by their sons, but I'm one of the few fathers who is known by his daughter, and I am proud of it.
Before that, she was my daughter, but now I am her father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we glance to human history, the story of women is the story of injustice, inequality, violence and exploitation.
She is not welcomed, neither by father nor by mother.
The neighborhood comes and commiserates with the mother, and nobody congratulates the father.
And a mother is very uncomfortable for having a girl child.
When she gives birth to the first girl child, first daughter, she is sad.
When she gives birth to the second daughter, she is shocked, and in the expectation of a son, when she gives birth to a third daughter, she feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only the mother suffers, but the daughter, the newly born daughter, when she grows old, she suffers too.
At the age of five, while she should be going to school, she stays at home and her brothers are admitted in a school.
Until the age of 12, somehow, she has a good life.
She can have fun.
She can play with her friends in the streets, and she can move around in the streets like a butterfly.
But when she enters her teens, when she becomes 13 years old, she is forbidden to go out of her home without a male escort.
She is confined under the four walls of her home.
She is no more a free individual.
She becomes the so-called honor of her father and of her brothers and of her family, and if she transgresses the code of that so-called honor, she could even be killed.
And it is also interesting that this so-called code of honor, it does not only affect the life of a girl, it also affects the life of the male members of the family.
I know a family of seven sisters and one brother, and that one brother, he has migrated to the Gulf countries, to earn a living for his seven sisters and parents, because he thinks that it will be humiliating if his seven sisters learn a skill and they go out of the home and earn some livelihood.
So this brother, he sacrifices the joys of his life and the happiness of his sisters at the altar of so-called honor.
And there is one more norm of the patriarchal societies that is called obedience.
A good girl is supposed to be very quiet, very humble and very submissive.
It is the criteria.
The role model good girl should be very quiet.
She is supposed to be silent and she is supposed to accept the decisions of her father and mother and the decisions of elders, even if she does not like them.
Otherwise, she will be called disobedient.
And what happens at the end?
In the words of a poetess, she is wedded, bedded, and then she gives birth to more sons and daughters.
And this vicious cycle goes on, goes on.
Ladies and gentlemen, this plight of millions of women could be changed if we think differently, if women and men think differently, if men and women in the tribal and patriarchal societies in the developing countries, if they can break a few norms of family and society, if they can abolish the discriminatory laws of the systems in their states, which go against the basic human rights of the women.
Dear brothers and sisters, when Malala was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborn children, to be honest, but when I went and I looked into her eyes, believe me, I got extremely honored.
And long before she was born, I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a heroic legendary freedom fighter in Afghanistan.
Her name was Malalai of Maiwand, and I named my daughter after her.
A few days after Malala was born, my daughter was born, my cousin came -- and it was a coincidence -- he came to my home and he brought a family tree, a family tree of the Yousafzai family, and when I looked at the family tree, it traced back to 300 years of our ancestors.
But when I looked, all were men, and I picked my pen, drew a line from my name, and wrote, "Malala."
And when she grow old, when she was four and a half years old, I admitted her in my school.
You will be asking, then, why should I mention about the admission of a girl in a school?
Yes, I must mention it.
It may be taken for granted in Canada, in America, in many developed countries, but in poor countries, in patriarchal societies, in tribal societies, it's a big event for the life of girl.
Enrollment in a school means recognition of her identity and her name.
Admission in a school means that she has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where she can explore her potentials for her future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and you will be astonished, two weeks before, when I was filling out the Canadian visa form, and I was filling out the family part of the form, I could not recall the surnames of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I have never, never seen the names of my sisters written on any document.
What my father could not give to my sisters and to his daughters, I thought I must change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the brilliance of my daughter.
I encouraged her to sit with me when my friends used to come.
I encouraged her to go with me to different meetings.
And all these good values, I tried to inculcate in her personality.
And this was not only she, only Malala.
I imparted all these good values to my school, girl students and boy students as well.
I used education for emancipation.
I taught my girls, I taught my girl students, to unlearn the lesson of obedience.
I taught my boy students to unlearn the lesson of so-called pseudo-honor.
Dear brothers and sisters, we were striving for more rights for women, and we were struggling to have more, more and more space for the women in society.
But we came across a new phenomenon.
It was lethal to human rights and particularly to women's rights.
It was called Talibanization.
It means a complete negation of women's participation in all political, economical and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
Girls were prohibited from going to school.
Women were forced to wear veils and they were stopped from going to the markets.
Musicians were silenced, girls were flogged and singers were killed.
Millions were suffering, but few spoke, and it was the most scary thing when you have all around such people who kill and who flog, and you speak for your rights.
It's really the most scary thing.
At the age of 10, Malala stood, and she stood for the right of education.
She wrote a diary for the BBC blog, she volunteered herself for the New York Times documentaries, and she spoke from every platform she could.
And her voice was the most powerful voice.
It spread like a crescendo all around the world.
And that was the reason the Taliban could not tolerate her campaign, and on October 9 2012, she was shot in the head at point blank range.
It was a doomsday for my family and for me.
The world turned into a big black hole.
While my daughter was on the verge of life and death, I whispered into the ears of my wife, "Should I be blamed for what happened to my daughter and your daughter?"
And she abruptly told me, "Please don't blame yourself.
You stood for the right cause.
You put your life at stake for the cause of truth, for the cause of peace, and for the cause of education, and your daughter in inspired from you and she joined you.
You both were on the right path and God will protect her."
These few words meant a lot to me, and I didn't ask this question again.
When Malala was in the hospital, and she was going through the severe pains and she had had severe headaches because her facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow spreading on the face of my wife.
But my daughter never complained.
She used to tell us, "I'm fine with my crooked smile and with my numbness in my face.
I'll be okay. Please don't worry."
She was a solace for us, and she consoled us.
Dear brothers and sisters, we learned from her how to be resilient in the most difficult times, and I'm glad to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights of children and women, she is like any 16-year old girl.
She cries when her homework is incomplete.
She quarrels with her brothers, and I am very happy for that.
People ask me, what special is in my mentorship which has made Malala so bold and so courageous and so vocal and poised?
I tell them, don't ask me what I did.
Ask me what I did not do.
I did not clip her wings, and that's all.
Thank you very much.
I'd like to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine yourself standing outside the front door of your home.
I'd like you to notice the color of the door, the material that it's made out of.
Now visualize a pack of overweight nudists on bicycles.
They are competing in a naked bicycle race, and they are headed straight for your front door.
I need you to actually see this.
They are pedaling really hard, they're sweaty, they're bouncing around a lot.
And they crash straight into the front door of your home.
Bicycles fly everywhere, wheels roll past you, spokes end up in awkward places.
Step over the threshold of your door into your foyer, your hallway, whatever's on the other side, and appreciate the quality of the light.
The light is shining down on Cookie Monster.
Cookie Monster is waving at you from his perch on top of a tan horse.
It's a talking horse.
You can practically feel his blue fur tickling your nose.
You can smell the oatmeal raisin cookie that he's about to shovel into his mouth.
Walk past him. Walk past him into your living room.
In your living room, in full imaginative broadband, picture Britney Spears.
She is scantily clad, she's dancing on your coffee table, and she's singing "Hit Me Baby One More Time."
And then follow me into your kitchen.
In your kitchen, the floor has been paved over with a yellow brick road and out of your oven are coming towards you Dorothy, the Tin Man, the Scarecrow and the Lion from "The Wizard of Oz," hand-in-hand skipping straight towards you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a very bizarre contest that is held every spring in New York City.
It's called the United States Memory Championship.
And I had gone to cover this contest a few years back as a science journalist expecting, I guess, that this was going to be like the Superbowl of savants.
This was a bunch of guys and a few ladies, widely varying in both age and hygienic upkeep.
They were memorizing hundreds of random numbers, looking at them just once.
They were memorizing the names of dozens and dozens and dozens of strangers.
They were memorizing entire poems in just a few minutes.
They were competing to see who could memorize the order of a shuffled pack of playing cards the fastest.
I was like, this is unbelievable.
These people must be freaks of nature.
And I started talking to a few of the competitors.
This is a guy called Ed Cook who had come over from England where he had one of the best trained memories.
And I said to him, "Ed, when did you realize that you were a savant?"
And Ed was like, "I'm not a savant.
In fact, I have just an average memory.
Everybody who competes in this contest will tell you that they have just an average memory.
We've all trained ourselves to perform these utterly miraculous feats of memory using a set of ancient techniques, techniques invented 2,500 years ago in Greece, the same techniques that Cicero had used to memorize his speeches, that medieval scholars had used to memorize entire books."
And I was like, "Whoa. How come I never heard of this before?"
And we were standing outside the competition hall, and Ed, who is a wonderful, brilliant, but somewhat eccentric English guy, says to me, "Josh, you're an American journalist.
Do you know Britney Spears?"
I'm like, "What? No. Why?"
"Because I really want to teach Britney Spears how to memorize the order of a shuffled pack of playing cards on U.S. national television.
It will prove to the world that anybody can do this."
I was like, "Well I'm not Britney Spears, but maybe you could teach me.
I mean, you've got to start somewhere, right?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending the better part of the next year not only training my memory, but also investigating it, trying to understand how it works, why it sometimes doesn't work and what its potential might be.
I met a host of really interesting people.
This is a guy called E.P.
He's an amnesic who had, very possibly, the very worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that he didn't even remember he had a memory problem, which is amazing.
And he was this incredibly tragic figure, but he was a window into the extent to which our memories make us who we are.
The other end of the spectrum: I met this guy.
This is Kim Peek.
He was the basis for Dustin Hoffman's character in the movie "Rain Man."
We spent an afternoon together in the Salt Lake City Public Library memorizing phone books, which was scintillating.
And I went back and I read a whole host of memory treatises, treatises written 2,000-plus years ago in Latin in Antiquity and then later in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a whole bunch of really interesting stuff.
One of the really interesting things that I learned is that once upon a time, this idea of having a trained, disciplined, cultivated memory was not nearly so alien as it would seem to us to be today.
Once upon a time, people invested in their memories, in laboriously furnishing their minds.
Over the last few millenia we've invented a series of technologies -- from the alphabet to the scroll to the codex, the printing press, photography, the computer, the smartphone -- that have made it progressively easier and easier for us to externalize our memories, for us to essentially outsource this fundamental human capacity.
These technologies have made our modern world possible, but they've also changed us.
They've changed us culturally, and I would argue that they've changed us cognitively.
Having little need to remember anymore, it sometimes seems like we've forgotten how.
One of the last places on Earth where you still find people passionate about this idea of a trained, disciplined, cultivated memory is at this totally singular memory contest.
It's actually not that singular, there are contests held all over the world.
And I was fascinated, I wanted to know how do these guys do it.
A few years back a group of researchers at University College London brought a bunch of memory champions into the lab.
They wanted to know: Do these guys have brains that are somehow structurally, anatomically different from the rest of ours?
The answer was no.
Are they smarter than the rest of us?
They gave them a bunch of cognitive tests, and the answer was not really.
There was however one really interesting and telling difference between the brains of the memory champions and the control subjects that they were comparing them to.
When they put these guys in an fMRI machine, scanned their brains while they were memorizing numbers and people's faces and pictures of snowflakes, they found that the memory champions were lighting up different parts of the brain than everyone else.
Of note, they were using, or they seemed to be using, a part of the brain that's involved in spatial memory and navigation.
Why? And is there something the rest of us can learn from this?
The sport of competitive memorizing is driven by a kind of arms race where every year somebody comes up with a new way to remember more stuff more quickly, and then the rest of the field has to play catchup.
This is my friend Ben Pridmore, three-time world memory champion.
On his desk in front of him are 36 shuffled packs of playing cards that he is about to try to memorize in one hour, using a technique that he invented and he alone has mastered.
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of 4,140 random binary digits in half an hour.
Yeah.
And while there are a whole host of ways of remembering stuff in these competitions, everything, all of the techniques that are being used, ultimately come down to a concept that psychologists refer to as elaborative encoding.
And it's well illustrated by a nifty paradox known as the Baker/baker paradox, which goes like this: If I tell two people to remember the same word, if I say to you, "Remember that there is a guy named Baker."
That's his name.
And I say to you, "Remember that there is a guy who is a baker."
And I come back to you at some point later on, and I say, "Do you remember that word that I told you a while back?
Do you remember what it was?"
The person who was told his name is Baker is less likely to remember the same word than the person was told his job is that he is a baker.
Same word, different amount of remembering; that's weird.
What's going on here?
Well the name Baker doesn't actually mean anything to you.
It is entirely untethered from all of the other memories floating around in your skull.
But the common noun baker, we know bakers.
Bakers wear funny white hats.
Bakers have flour on their hands.
Bakers smell good when they come home from work.
Maybe we even know a baker.
And when we first hear that word, we start putting these associational hooks into it that make it easier to fish it back out at some later date.
The entire art of what is going on in these memory contests and the entire art of remembering stuff better in everyday life is figuring out ways to transform capital B Bakers into lower-case B bakers -- to take information that is lacking in context, in significance, in meaning and transform it in some way so that it becomes meaningful in the light of all the other things that you have in your mind.
One of the more elaborate techniques for doing this dates back 2,500 years to Ancient Greece.
It came to be known as the memory palace.
The story behind its creation goes like this: There was a poet called Simonides who was attending a banquet.
He was actually the hired entertainment, because back then if you wanted to throw a really slamming party, you didn't hire a D.J., you hired a poet.
And he stands up, delivers his poem from memory, walks out the door, and at the moment he does, the banquet hall collapses, kills everybody inside.
It doesn't just kill everybody, it mangles the bodies beyond all recognition.
Nobody can say who was inside, nobody can say where they were sitting.
The bodies can't be properly buried.
It's one tragedy compounding another.
Simonides, standing outside, the sole survivor amid the wreckage, closes his eyes and has this realization, which is that in his mind's eye, he can see where each of the guests at the banquet had been sitting.
And he takes the relatives by the hand and guides them each to their loved ones amid the wreckage.
What Simonides figured out at that moment is something that I think we all kind of intuitively know, which is that, as bad as we are at remembering names and phone numbers and word-for-word instructions from our colleagues, we have really exceptional visual and spatial memories.
If I asked you to recount the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about Simonides, chances are you would have a tough time with it.
But I would wager that if I asked you to recall who is sitting on top of a talking tan horse in your foyer right now, you would be able to see that.
The idea behind the memory palace is to create this imagined edifice in your mind's eye and populate it with images of the things that you want to remember -- the crazier, weirder, more bizarre, funnier, raunchier, stinkier the image is, the more unforgettable it's likely to be.
This is advice that goes back 2,000-plus years to the earliest Latin memory treatises.
So how does this work?
Let's say that you've been invited to TED center stage to give a speech and you want to do it from memory, and you want to do it the way that Cicero would have done it if he had been invited to TEDxRome 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is picture yourself at the front door of your house.
And you'd come up with some sort of an absolutely crazy, ridiculous, unforgettable image to remind you that the first thing you want to talk about is this totally bizarre contest.
And then you'd go inside your house, and you would see an image of Cookie Monster on top of Mister Ed.
And that would remind you that you would want to then introduce your friend Ed Cook.
And then you'd see an image of Britney Spears to remind you of this funny anecdote you want to tell.
And you go into your kitchen, and the fourth topic you were going to talk about was this strange journey that you went on for a year, and you have some friends to help you remember that.
This is how Roman orators memorized their speeches -- not word-for-word, which is just going to screw you up, but topic-for-topic.
In fact, the phrase "topic sentence," that comes from the Greek word "topos," which means "place."
That's a vestige of when people used to think about oratory and rhetoric in these sorts of spatial terms.
The phrase "in the first place," that's like in the first place of your memory palace.
I thought this was just fascinating, and I got really into it.
And I went to a few more of these memory contests.
And I had this notion that I might write something longer about this subculture of competitive memorizers.
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory contest is a pathologically boring event.
Truly, it is like a bunch of people sitting around taking the SATs.
I mean, the most dramatic it gets is when somebody starts massaging their temples.
And I'm a journalist, I need something to write about.
I know that there's this incredible stuff happening in these people's minds, but I don't have access to it.
And I realized, if I was going to tell this story, I needed to walk in their shoes a little bit.
And so I started trying to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning before I sat down with my New York Times just trying to remember something.
Maybe it was a poem.
Maybe it was names from an old yearbook that I bought at a flea market.
And I found that this was shockingly fun.
I never would have expected that.
It was fun because this is actually not about training your memory.
What you're doing is you're trying to get better and better and better at creating, at dreaming up, these utterly ludicrous, raunchy, hilarious and hopefully unforgettable images in your mind's eye.
And I got pretty into it.
This is me wearing my standard competitive memorizer's training kit.
It's a pair of earmuffs and a set of safety goggles that have been masked over except for two small pinholes, because distraction is the competitive memorizer's greatest enemy.
I ended up coming back to that same contest that I had covered a year earlier.
And I had this notion that I might enter it, sort of as an experiment in participatory journalism.
It'd make, I thought, maybe a nice epilogue to all my research.
Problem was the experiment went haywire.
I won the contest, which really wasn't supposed to happen.
Now it is nice to be able to memorize speeches and phone numbers and shopping lists, but it's actually kind of beside the point.
These are just tricks.
They are tricks that work because they're based on some pretty basic principles about how our brains work.
And you don't have to be building memory palaces or memorizing packs of playing cards to benefit from a little bit of insight about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with great memories as though it were some sort of an innate gift, but that is not the case.
Great memories are learned.
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
We remember when we are deeply engaged.
We remember when we are able to take a piece of information and experience and figure out why it is meaningful to us, why it is significant, why it's colorful, when we're able to transform it in some way that it makes sense in the light of all of the other things floating around in our minds, when we're able to transform Bakers into bakers.
The memory palace, these memory techniques, they're just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even really shortcuts.
They work because they make you work.
They force a kind of depth of processing, a kind of mindfulness, that most of us don't normally walk around exercising.
But there actually are no shortcuts.
This is how stuff is made memorable.
And I think if there's one thing that I want to leave you with, it's what E.P., the amnesic who couldn't even remember that he had a memory problem, left me with, which is the notion that our lives are the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose from our already short lives by losing ourselves in our Blackberries, our iPhones, by not paying attention to the human being across from us who is talking with us, by being so lazy that we're not willing to process deeply?
I learned firsthand that there are incredible memory capacities latent in all of us.
But if you want to live a memorable life, you have to be the kind of person who remembers to remember.
Thank you.
So I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start by reminding you of the standard views that people have about trust.
I think these are so commonplace, they've become clichés of our society.
And I think there are three.
One's a claim: there has been a great decline in trust, very widely believed.
The second is an aim: we should have more trust.
And the third is a task: we should rebuild trust.
I think that the claim, the aim and the task are all misconceived.
So what I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a claim, an aim and a task which I think give one quite a lot better purchase on the matter.
First the claim: Why do people think trust has declined?
And if I really think about it on the basis of my own evidence, I don't know the answer.
I'm inclined to think it may have declined in some activities or some institutions and it might have grown in others.
I don't have an overview.
But, of course, I can look at the opinion polls, and the opinion polls are supposedly the source of a belief that trust has declined.
When you actually look at opinion polls across time, there's not much evidence for that.
That's to say, the people who were mistrusted 20 years ago, principally journalists and politicians, are still mistrusted.
And the people who were highly trusted 20 years ago are still rather highly trusted: judges, nurses.
The rest of us are in between, and by the way, the average person in the street is almost exactly midway.
But is that good evidence?
What opinion polls record is, of course, opinions.
What else can they record?
So they're looking at the generic attitudes that people report when you ask them certain questions.
Do you trust politicians? Do you trust teachers?
Now if somebody said to you, "Do you trust greengrocers?
Do you trust fishmongers?
Do you trust elementary school teachers?"
you would probably begin by saying, "To do what?"
And that would be a perfectly sensible response.
And you might say, when you understood the answer to that, "Well, I trust some of them, but not others."
That's a perfectly rational thing.
In short, in our real lives, we seek to place trust in a differentiated way.
We don't make an assumption that the level of trust that we will have in every instance of a certain type of official or office-holder or type of person is going to be uniform.
I might, for example, say that I certainly trust a certain elementary school teacher I know to teach the reception class to read, but in no way to drive the school minibus.
I might, after all, know that she wasn't a good driver.
I might trust my most loquacious friend to keep a conversation going but not -- but perhaps not to keep a secret.
Simple.
So if we've got those evidence in our ordinary lives of the way that trust is differentiated, why do we sort of drop all that intelligence when we think about trust more abstractly?
I think the polls are very bad guides to the level of trust that actually exists, because they try to obliterate the good judgment that goes into placing trust.
Secondly, what about the aim?
The aim is to have more trust.
Well frankly, I think that's a stupid aim.
It's not what I would aim at.
I would aim to have more trust in the trustworthy but not in the untrustworthy.
In fact, I aim positively to try not to trust the untrustworthy.
And I think, of those people who, for example, placed their savings with the very aptly named Mr. Madoff, who then made off with them, and I think of them, and I think, well, yes, too much trust.
More trust is not an intelligent aim in this life.
Intelligently placed and intelligently refused trust is the proper aim.
Well once one says that, one says, yeah, okay, that means that what matters in the first place is not trust but trustworthiness.
It's judging how trustworthy people are in particular respects.
And I think that judgment requires us to look at three things.
Are they competent? Are they honest? Are they reliable?
And if we find that a person is competent in the relevant matters, and reliable and honest, we'll have a pretty good reason to trust them, because they'll be trustworthy.
But if, on the other hand, they're unreliable, we might not.
I have friends who are competent and honest, but I would not trust them to post a letter, because they're forgetful.
I have friends who are very confident they can do certain things, but I realize that they overestimate their own competence.
And I'm very glad to say, I don't think I have many friends who are competent and reliable but extremely dishonest.
If so, I haven't yet spotted it.
But that's what we're looking for: trustworthiness before trust.
Trust is the response.
Trustworthiness is what we have to judge. And, of course, it's difficult.
Across the last few decades, we've tried to construct systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions and professionals and officials and so on that will make it easier for us to judge their trustworthiness.
A lot of these systems have the converse effect.
They don't work as they're supposed to.
I remember I was talking with a midwife who said, "Well, you see, the problem is it takes longer to do the paperwork than to deliver the baby."
And all over our public life, our institutional life, we find that problem, that the system of accountability that is meant to secure trustworthiness and evidence of trustworthiness is actually doing the opposite.
It is distracting people who have to do difficult tasks, like midwives, from doing them by requiring them to tick the boxes, as we say.
You can all give your own examples there.
So so much for the aim.
The aim, I think, is more trustworthiness, and that is going to be different if we are trying to be trustworthy and communicate our trustworthiness to other people, and if we are trying to judge whether other people or office-holders or politicians are trustworthy.
It's not easy. It is judgment, and simple reaction, attitudes, don't do adequately here.
Now thirdly, the task.
Calling the task rebuilding trust, I think, also gets things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
Well, we can do that for ourselves.
We can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it two people together trying to improve trust.
But trust, in the end, is distinctive because it's given by other people.
You can't rebuild what other people give you.
You have to give them the basis for giving you their trust.
So you have to, I think, be trustworthy.
And that, of course, is because you can't fool all of the people all of the time, usually.
But you also have to provide usable evidence that you are trustworthy.
How to do it?
Well every day, all over the place, it's being done by ordinary people, by officials, by institutions, quite effectively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The shop where I buy my socks says I may take them back, and they don't ask any questions.
They take them back and give me the money or give me the pair of socks of the color I wanted.
That's super. I trust them because they have made themselves vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you make yourself vulnerable to the other party, then that is very good evidence that you are trustworthy and you have confidence in what you are saying.
So in the end, I think what we are aiming for is not very difficult to discern.
It is relationships in which people are trustworthy and can judge when and how the other person is trustworthy.
So the moral of all this is, we need to think much less about trust, let alone about attitudes of trust detected or mis-detected by opinion polls, much more about being trustworthy, and how you give people adequate, useful and simple evidence that you're trustworthy.
Thanks.
The world makes you something that you're not, but you know inside what you are, and that question burns in your heart: How will you become that?
I may be somewhat unique in this, but I am not alone, not alone at all.
So when I became a fashion model, I felt that I'd finally achieved the dream that I'd always wanted since I was a young child.
My outside self finally matched my inner truth, my inner self.
For complicated reasons which I'll get to later, when I look at this picture, at that time I felt like, Geena, you've done it, you've made it, you have arrived.
But this past October, I realized that I'm only just beginning.
All of us are put in boxes by our family, by our religion, by our society, our moment in history, even our own bodies.
Some people have the courage to break free, not to accept the limitations imposed by the color of their skin or by the beliefs of those that surround them.
Those people are always the threat to the status quo, to what is considered acceptable.
In my case, for the last nine years, some of my neighbors, some of my friends, colleagues, even my agent, did not know about my history.
I remember when I was five years old in the Philippines walking around our house, I would always wear this t-shirt on my head.
And my mom asked me, "How come you always wear that t-shirt on your head?"
I said, "Mom, this is my hair. I'm a girl."
I knew then how to self-identify.
Gender has always been considered a fact, immutable, but we now know it's actually more fluid, complex and mysterious.
Because of my success, I never had the courage to share my story, not because I thought what I am is wrong, but because of how the world treats those of us who wish to break free.
Every day, I am so grateful because I am a woman.
I have a mom and dad and family who accepted me for who I am.
Many are not so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in Asian culture that celebrates the fluid mystery of gender.
There is a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There is a Hindu goddess, hijra goddess.
So when I was eight years old, I was at a fiesta in the Philippines celebrating these mysteries.
I was in front of the stage, and I remember, out comes this beautiful woman right in front of me, and I remember that moment something hit me: That is the kind of woman I would like to be.
So when I was 15 years old, still dressing as a boy, I met this woman named T.L.
She is a transgender beauty pageant manager.
That night she asked me, "How come you are not joining the beauty pageant?"
That moment changed my life.
All of a sudden, I was introduced to the world of beauty pageants.
Not a lot of people could say that your first job is a pageant queen for transgender women, but I'll take it.
So from 15 to 17 years old, I joined the most prestigious pageant to the pageant where it's at the back of the truck, literally, or sometimes it would be a pavement next to a rice field, and when it rains -- it rains a lot in the Philippines -- the organizers would have to move it inside someone's house.
I also experienced the goodness of strangers, especially when we would travel in remote provinces in the Philippines.
But most importantly, I met some of my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom, who had moved to San Francisco, called me and told me that my green card petition came through, that I could now move to the United States.
I resisted it.
I told my mom, "Mom, I'm having fun.
I'm here with my friends, I love traveling, being a beauty pageant queen."
But then two weeks later she called me, she said, "Did you know that if you move to the United States you could change your name and gender marker?"
That was all I needed to hear.
My mom also told me to put two E's in the spelling of my name.
She also came with me when I had my surgery in Thailand at 19 years old.
It's interesting, in some of the most rural cities in Thailand, they perform some of the most prestigious, safe and sophisticated surgery.
At that time in the United States, you needed to have surgery before you could change your name and gender marker.
So in 2001, I moved to San Francisco, and I remember looking at my California driver's license with the name Geena and gender marker F.
That was a powerful moment.
For some people, their I.D. is their license to drive or even to get a drink, but for me, that was my license to live, to feel dignified.
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York and be a model.
Many are not so fortunate.
I think of this woman named Islan Nettles.
She's from New York, she's a young woman who was courageously living her truth, but hatred ended her life.
For most of my community, this is the reality in which we live.
Our suicide rate is nine times higher than that of the general population.
Every November 20, we have a global vigil for Transgender Day of Remembrance.
I'm here at this stage because it's a long history of people who fought and stood up for injustice.
This is Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera.
Today, this very moment, is my real coming out.
I could no longer live my truth for and by myself.
I want to do my best to help others live their truth without shame and terror.
I am here, exposed, so that one day there will never be a need for a November 20 vigil.
My deepest truth allowed me to accept who I am.
Will you?
Thank you very much.
I'm wondering what you would say, especially to parents, but in a more broad way, to friends, to family, to anyone who finds themselves encountering a child or a person who is struggling with and uncomfortable with a gender that's being assigned them, what might you say to the family members of that person to help them become good and caring and kind family members to them?
Geena Rocero: Sure. Well, first, really, I'm so blessed.
And sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, so — But it's just, gender identity is in the core of our being, right?
I mean, we're all assigned gender at birth, so what I'm trying to do is to have this conversation that sometimes that gender assignment doesn't match, and there should be a space that would allow people to self-identify, and that's a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The transgender movement, it's at the very beginning, to compare to how the gay movement started.
There's still a lot of work that needs to be done.
There should be an understanding.
There should be a space of curiosity and asking questions, and I hope all of you guys will be my allies.
Thank you. That was so lovely. Thank you.
So, we used to solve big problems.
On July 21st, 1969, Buzz Aldrin climbed out of Apollo 11's lunar module and descended onto the Sea of Tranquility.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but their presence on the moon's gray surface was the culmination of a convulsive, collective effort.
The Apollo program was the greatest peacetime mobilization in the history of the United States.
To get to the moon, NASA spent around 180 billion dollars in today's money, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo employed around 400,000 people and demanded the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
People died, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program ended, 24 men flew to the moon.
Twelve walked on its surface, of whom Aldrin, following the death of Armstrong last year, is now the most senior.
So why did they go?
They didn't bring much back: 841 pounds of old rocks, and something all 24 later emphasized -- a new sense of the smallness and the fragility of our common home.
Why did they go? The cynical answer is they went because President Kennedy wanted to show the Soviets that his nation had the better rockets.
But Kennedy's own words at Rice University in 1962 provide a better clue.
To contemporaries, Apollo wasn't only a victory of West over East in the Cold War.
At the time, the strongest emotion was of wonder at the transcendent powers of technology.
They went because it was a big thing to do.
Landing on the moon occurred in the context of a long series of technological triumphs.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the airplane, penicillin and a vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle years of the century, polio was eradicated and smallpox eliminated.
Technology itself seemed to possess what Alvin Toffler in 1970 called "accelerative thrust."
For most of human history, we could go no faster than a horse or a boat with a sail, but in 1969, the crew of Apollo 10 flew at 25,000 miles an hour.
Since 1970, no human beings have been back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and blithe optimism about technology's powers has evaporated as big problems we had imagined technology would solve, such as going to Mars, creating clean energy, curing cancer, or feeding the world have come to seem intractably hard.
I remember watching the liftoff of Apollo 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me not to stare at the fiery exhaust of a Saturn V rocket.
I vaguely knew this was to be the last of the moon missions, but I was absolutely certain there would be Mars colonies in my lifetime.
So "Something happened to our capacity to solve big problems with technology" has become a commonplace.
You hear it all the time.
We've heard it over the last two days here at TED.
It feels as if technologists have diverted us and enriched themselves with trivial toys, with things like iPhones and apps and social media, or algorithms that speed automated trading.
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But they don't solve humanity's big problems.
What happened?
So there is a parochial explanation in Silicon Valley, which admits that it has been funding less ambitious companies than it did in the years when it financed Intel, Microsoft, Apple and Genentech.
Silicon Valley says the markets are to blame, in particular the incentives that venture capitalists offer to entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that venture investing shifted away from funding transformational ideas and towards funding incremental problems or even fake problems.
But I don't think that explanation is good enough.
It mostly explains what's wrong with Silicon Valley.
Even when venture capitalists were at their most risk-happy, they preferred small investments, tiny investments that offered an exit within 10 years.
V.C.s have always struggled to invest profitably in technologies such as energy whose capital requirements are huge and whose development is long and lengthy, and V.C.s have never, never funded the development of technologies meant to solve big problems that possess no immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons we can't solve big problems are more complicated and more profound.
Sometimes we choose not to solve big problems.
We could go to Mars if we want.
NASA even has the outline of a plan.
But going to Mars would follow a political decision with popular appeal, and that will never happen.
We won't go to Mars, because everyone thinks there are more important things to do here on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve big problems because our political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption derives from advanced, renewable sources such as solar, wind and biofuels, less than two percent, and the reason is purely economic.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and petroleum is cheaper than biofuels.
We want alternative energy sources that can compete on price. None exist.
Now, technologists, business leaders and economists all basically agree on what national policies and international treaties would spur the development of alternative energy: mostly, a significant increase in energy research and development, and some kind of price on carbon.
But there's no hope in the present political climate that we will see U.S. energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, big problems that had seemed technological turn out not to be so.
Famines were long understood to be caused by failures in food supply.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crises that catastrophically affect food distribution.
Technology can improve things like crop yields or systems for storing and transporting food, but there will be famines so long as there are bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes elude solution because we don't really understand the problem.
President Nixon declared war on cancer in 1971, but we soon discovered there are many kinds of cancer, most of them fiendishly resistant to therapy, and it is only in the last 10 years that effective, viable therapies have come to seem real.
Hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve big problems through technology.
We can, we must, but these four elements must all be present: Political leaders and the public must care to solve a problem; institutions must support its solution; It must really be a technological problem; and we must understand it.
The Apollo mission, which has become a kind of metaphor for technology's capacity to solve big problems, met these criteria.
But it is an irreproducible model for the future.
It is not 1961.
There is no galvanizing contest like the Cold War, no politician like John Kennedy who can heroize the difficult and the dangerous, and no popular science fictional mythology such as exploring the solar system.
Most of all, going to the moon turned out to be easy.
It was just three days away.
And arguably it wasn't even solving much of a problem.
We are left alone with our day, and the solutions of the future will be harder won.
God knows, we don't lack for the challenges.
Thank you very much.
This is my niece, Stella.
She's just turned one and started to walk.
And she's walking in that really cool way that one-year-olds do, a kind of teetering, my-body's-moving- too-fast-for-my-legs kind of way.
It is absolutely gorgeous.
And one of her favorite things to do at the moment is to stare at herself in the mirror.
She absolutely loves her reflection.
She giggles and squeals, and gives herself these big, wet kisses.
When is it suddenly not okay to love the way that we look?
Because apparently we don't.
Ten thousand people every month google, "Am I ugly?"
This is Faye. Faye is 13 and she lives in Denver.
And like any teenager, she just wants to be liked and to fit in.
And she's slightly dreading it, and she's a bit confused because despite her mom telling her all the time that she's beautiful, every day at school, someone tells her that she's ugly.
Because of the difference between what her mom tells her and what her friends at school, or her peers at school are telling her, she doesn't know who to believe.
Some of them are so nasty, they don't bear thinking about.
This is an average, healthy-looking teenage girl receiving this feedback at one of the most emotionally vulnerable times in her life.
Well, today's teenagers are rarely alone.
They're under pressure to be online and available at all times, talking, messaging, liking, commenting, sharing, posting — it never ends.
Never before have we been so connected, so continuously, so instantaneously, so young.
And as one mom told me, it's like there's a party in their bedroom every night.
There's simply no privacy.
And the social pressures that go along with that are relentless.
This always-on environment is training our kids to value themselves based on the number of likes they get and the types of comments that they receive.
There's no separation between online and offline life.
What's real or what isn't is really hard to tell the difference between.
And where are they looking to for inspiration?
Well, you can see the kinds of images that are covering the newsfeeds of girls today.
Size zero models still dominate our catwalks.
Airbrushing is now routine.
And trends like #thinspiration, #thighgap, #bikinibridge and #proana.
For those who don't know, #proana means pro-anorexia.
These trends are teamed with the stereotyping and flagrant objectification of women in today's popular culture.
It is not hard to see what girls are benchmarking themselves against.
But boys are not immune to this either.
Aspiring to the chiseled jaw lines and ripped six packs of superhero-like sports stars and playboy music artists.
But, what's the problem with all of this?
Well, surely we want our kids to grow up as healthy, well balanced individuals.
But in an image-obsessed culture, we are training our kids to spend more time and mental effort on their appearance at the expense of all of the other aspects of their identities.
So, things like their relationships, the development of their physical abilities, and their studies and so on begin to suffer.
Six out of 10 girls are now choosing not to do something because they don't think they look good enough.
These are not trivial activities.
These are fundamental activities to their development as humans and as contributors to society and to the workforce.
Thirty-one percent, nearly one in three teenagers, are withdrawing from classroom debate. They're failing to engage in classroom debate because they don't want to draw attention to the way that they look.
One in five are not showing up to class at all on days when they don't feel good about it.
And when it comes to exams, if you don't think you look good enough, specifically if you don't think you are thin enough, you will score a lower grade point average than your peers who are not concerned with this.
And this is consistent across Finland, the U.S.
and China, and is true regardless of how much you actually weigh.
So to be super clear, we're talking about the way you think you look, not how you actually look.
Low body confidence is undermining academic achievement.
But it's also damaging health.
Teenagers with low body confidence do less physical activity, eat less fruits and vegetables, partake in more unhealthy weight control practices that can lead to eating disorders.
And we don't grow out of it.
Women who think they're overweight — again, regardless of whether they are or are not — have higher rates of absenteeism.
Seventeen percent of women would not show up to a job interview on a day when they weren't feeling confident about the way that they look.
Have a think about what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what that opportunity looks like.
Unlocking this potential is in the interest of every single one of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, talking, on its own, only gets you so far.
It's not enough by itself.
If you actually want to make a difference, you have to do something.
And we've learned there are three key ways: The first is we have to educate for body confidence.
We have to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome image-related pressures and build their self-esteem.
Now, the good news is that there are many programs out there available to do this.
The bad news is that most of them don't work.
I was shocked to learn that many well-meaning programs are inadvertently actually making the situation worse.
So we need to make damn sure that the programs that our kids are receiving are not only having a positive impact, but having a lasting impact as well.
And the research shows that the best programs address six key areas: The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
The second is media and celebrity culture, then how to handle teasing and bullying, the way we compete and compare with one another based on looks, talking about appearance — some people call this "body talk" or "fat talk" — and finally, the foundations of respecting and looking after yourself.
Challenging the status quo of how women are seen and talked about in our own circles.
It is not okay that we judge the contribution of our politicians by their haircuts or the size of their breasts, or to infer that the determination or the success of an Olympian is down to her not being a looker.
We need to start judging people by what they do, not what they look like.
We can all start by taking responsibility for the types of pictures and comments that we post on our own social networks.
We can compliment people based on their effort and their actions and not on their appearance.
And let me ask you, when was the last time that you kissed a mirror?
Ultimately, we need to work together as communities, as governments and as businesses to really change this culture of ours so that our kids grow up valuing their whole selves, valuing individuality, diversity, inclusion.
We need to put the people that are making a real difference on our pedestals, making a difference in the real world.
Giving them the airtime, because only then will we create a different world.
A world where our kids are free to become the best versions of themselves, where the way they think they look never holds them back from being who they are or achieving what they want in life.
Think about what this might mean for someone in your life.
Your friend? It could just be the woman a couple of seats away from you today.
What would it mean for her if she were freed from that voice of her inner critic, nagging her to have longer legs, thinner thighs, smaller stomach, shorter feet?
What could it mean for her if we overcame this and unlocked her potential in that way?
Right now, our culture's obsession with image is holding us all back.
But let's show our kids the truth.
Let's show them that the way you look is just one part of your identity and that the truth is we love them for who they are and what they do and how they make us feel.
Let's build self-esteem into our school curriculums.
Let's each and every one of us change the way we talk and compare ourselves to other people.
And let's work together as communities, from grassroots to governments, so that the happy little one-year-olds of today become the confident changemakers of tomorrow.
Let's do this.
So when I was eight years old, a new girl came to join the class, and she was so impressive, as the new girl always seems to be.
She had vast quantities of very shiny hair and a cute little pencil case, super strong on state capitals, just a great speller.
And I just curdled with jealousy that year, until I hatched my devious plan.
So one day I stayed a little late after school, a little too late, and I lurked in the girls' bathroom.
When the coast was clear, I emerged, crept into the classroom, and took from my teacher's desk the grade book.
And then I did it.
I fiddled with my rival's grades, just a little, just demoted some of those A's.
All of those A's.
And I got ready to return the book to the drawer, when hang on, some of my other classmates had appallingly good grades too.
So, in a frenzy, I corrected everybody's marks, not imaginatively.
I gave everybody a row of D's and I gave myself a row of A's, just because I was there, you know, might as well.
And I am still baffled by my behavior.
I don't understand where the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt so great doing it.
I felt great.
I don't understand why I was never caught.
I mean, it should have been so blatantly obvious.
I was never caught.
But most of all, I am baffled by, why did it bother me so much that this little girl, this tiny little girl, was so good at spelling?
Jealousy baffles me.
It's so mysterious, and it's so pervasive.
We know babies suffer from jealousy.
We know primates do. Bluebirds are actually very prone.
We know that jealousy is the number one cause of spousal murder in the United States.
And yet, I have never read a study that can parse to me its loneliness or its longevity or its grim thrill.
For that, we have to go to fiction, because the novel is the lab that has studied jealousy in every possible configuration.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if we didn't have jealousy, would we even have literature?
Well no faithless Helen, no "Odyssey."
No jealous king, no "Arabian Nights."
No Shakespeare.
There goes high school reading lists, because we're losing "Sound and the Fury," we're losing "Gatsby," "Sun Also Rises," we're losing "Madame Bovary," "Anna K."
No jealousy, no Proust. And now, I mean, I know it's fashionable to say that Proust has the answers to everything, but in the case of jealousy, he kind of does.
This year is the centennial of his masterpiece, "In Search of Lost Time," and it's the most exhaustive study of sexual jealousy and just regular competitiveness, my brand, that we can hope to have.
And we think about Proust, we think about the sentimental bits, right?
We think about a little boy trying to get to sleep.
We think about a madeleine moistened in lavender tea.
We forget how harsh his vision was.
We forget how pitiless he is.
I mean, these are books that Virginia Woolf said were tough as cat gut.
I don't know what cat gut is, but let's assume it's formidable.
Let's look at why they go so well together, the novel and jealousy, jealousy and Proust.
Is it something as obvious as that jealousy, which boils down into person, desire, impediment, is such a solid narrative foundation?
I don't know. I think it cuts very close to the bone, because let's think about what happens when we feel jealous.
When we feel jealous, we tell ourselves a story.
We tell ourselves a story about other people's lives, and these stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel terrible.
As the teller of the tale and the audience, we know just what details to include, to dig that knife in. Right?
Jealousy makes us all amateur novelists, and this is something Proust understood.
In the first volume, Swann's Way, the series of books, Swann, one of the main characters, is thinking very fondly of his mistress and how great she is in bed, and suddenly, in the course of a few sentences, and these are Proustian sentences, so they're long as rivers, but in the course of a few sentences, he suddenly recoils and he realizes, "Hang on, everything I love about this woman, somebody else would love about this woman.
Everything that she does that gives me pleasure could be giving somebody else pleasure, maybe right about now."
And this is the story he starts to tell himself, and from then on, Proust writes that every fresh charm Swann detects in his mistress, he adds to his "collection of instruments in his private torture chamber."
Now Swann and Proust, we have to admit, were notoriously jealous.
You know, Proust's boyfriends would have to leave the country if they wanted to break up with him.
But you don't have to be that jealous to concede that it's hard work. Right?
Jealousy is exhausting.
It's a hungry emotion. It must be fed.
And what does jealousy like?
Jealousy likes information.
Jealousy likes details.
Jealousy likes the vast quantities of shiny hair, the cute little pencil case.
Jealousy likes photos.
That's why Instagram is such a hit.
Proust actually links the language of scholarship and jealousy.
When Swann is in his jealous throes, and suddenly he's listening at doorways and bribing his mistress' servants, he defends these behaviors.
He says, "You know, look, I know you think this is repugnant, but it is no different from interpreting an ancient text or looking at a monument."
He says, "They are scientific investigations with real intellectual value."
Proust is trying to show us that jealousy feels intolerable and makes us look absurd, but it is, at its crux, a quest for knowledge, a quest for truth, painful truth, and actually, where Proust is concerned, the more painful the truth, the better.
Grief, humiliation, loss: These were the avenues to wisdom for Proust.
He says, "A woman whom we need, who makes us suffer, elicits from us a gamut of feelings far more profound and vital than a man of genius who interests us."
Is he telling us to just go and find cruel women?
No. I think he's trying to say that jealousy reveals us to ourselves.
And does any other emotion crack us open in this particular way?
Does any other emotion reveal to us our aggression and our hideous ambition and our entitlement?
Does any other emotion teach us to look with such peculiar intensity?
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by this very anxious young man who was consumed with the thought of his wife cheating on him.
And Freud says, it's something strange about this guy, because he's not looking at what his wife is doing.
Because she's blameless; everybody knows it.
The poor creature is just under suspicion for no cause.
But he's looking for things that his wife is doing without noticing, unintentional behaviors.
Is she smiling too brightly here, or did she accidentally brush up against a man there?
[Freud] says that the man is becoming the custodian of his wife's unconscious.
The novel is very good on this point.
The novel is very good at describing how jealousy trains us to look with intensity but not accuracy.
In fact, the more intensely jealous we are, the more we become residents of fantasy.
And this is why, I think, jealousy doesn't just provoke us to do violent things or illegal things.
Jealousy prompts us to behave in ways that are wildly inventive.
Now I'm thinking of myself at eight, I concede, but I'm also thinking of this story I heard on the news.
A 52-year-old Michigan woman was caught creating a fake Facebook account from which she sent vile, hideous messages to herself for a year.
For a year. A year.
And she was trying to frame her ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend, and I have to confess when I heard this, I just reacted with admiration.
Because, I mean, let's be real.
What immense, if misplaced, creativity. Right?
This is something from a novel.
This is something from a Patricia Highsmith novel.
Now Highsmith is a particular favorite of mine.
She is the very brilliant and bizarre woman of American letters.
She's the author of "Strangers on a Train" and "The Talented Mr. Ripley," books that are all about how jealousy, it muddles our minds, and once we're in the sphere, in that realm of jealousy, the membrane between what is and what could be can be pierced in an instant.
Take Tom Ripley, her most famous character.
Now, Tom Ripley goes from wanting you or wanting what you have to being you and having what you once had, and you're under the floorboards, he's answering to your name, he's wearing your rings, emptying your bank account.
That's one way to go.
But what do we do? We can't go the Tom Ripley route.
I can't give the world D's, as much as I would really like to, some days.
And it's a pity, because we live in envious times.
We live in jealous times.
I mean, we're all good citizens of social media, aren't we, where the currency is envy?
Does the novel show us a way out? I'm not sure.
So let's do what characters always do when they're not sure, when they are in possession of a mystery.
Let's go to 221B Baker Street and ask for Sherlock Holmes.
When people think of Holmes, they think of his nemesis being Professor Moriarty, right, this criminal mastermind.
But I've always preferred [Inspector] Lestrade, who is the rat-faced head of Scotland Yard who needs Holmes desperately, needs Holmes' genius, but resents him.
Oh, it's so familiar to me.
So Lestrade needs his help, resents him, and sort of seethes with bitterness over the course of the mysteries.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The Adventure of the Six Napoleons," once Holmes comes in, dazzles everybody with his solution, Lestrade turns to Holmes and he says, "We're not jealous of you, Mr. Holmes.
We're proud of you."
And he says that there's not a man at Scotland Yard who wouldn't want to shake Sherlock Holmes' hand.
It's one of the few times we see Holmes moved in the mysteries, and I find it very moving, this little scene, but it's also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat jealousy as a problem of geometry, not emotion.
You know, one minute Holmes is on the other side from Lestrade.
The next minute they're on the same side.
Suddenly, Lestrade is letting himself admire this mind that he's resented.
Could it be so simple though?
What if jealousy really is a matter of geometry, just a matter of where we allow ourselves to stand in relation to another?
Well, maybe then we wouldn't have to resent somebody's excellence.
We could align ourselves with it.
But I like contingency plans.
So while we wait for that to happen, let us remember that we have fiction for consolation.
Fiction alone demystifies jealousy.
Fiction alone domesticates it, invites it to the table.
And look who it gathers: sweet Lestrade, terrifying Tom Ripley, crazy Swann, Marcel Proust himself.
We are in excellent company.
Thank you.
My work focuses on the connection of both thinking about our community life being part of the environment where architecture grows from the natural local conditions and traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects as an example of this.
Both projects are in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and another one in Tunisia.
And also they have in common that the different analyses from different perspectives becomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a multistory shopping mall in Ethiopia's capital city Addis Ababa.
And this is the type of building we were shown as an example, to my team and myself, of what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, I want to run away.
After seeing a few of these buildings -- there are many in the city -- we realized that they have three very big points.
First, these buildings, they are almost empty because they have very large shops where people cannot afford to buy things.
Second, they need tons of energy to perform because of the skin treatment with glass that creates heat in the inside, and then you need a lot of cooling.
In a city where this shouldn't happen because they have really mild weather that ranges from 20 to 25 degrees the whole year.
And third is that their image has nothing to do with Africa and with Ethiopia.
It is a pity in a place that has such rich culture and traditions.
Also during our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really captivated by the old merkato that is this open-air structure where thousands of people, they go and buy things every day from small vendors.
And also it has this idea of the public space that uses the outdoors to create activity.
So I thought, this is what I really want to design, not a shopping mall.
But the question was how we could do a multistory, contemporary building with these principles.
The next challenge was when we looked at the site, that is, in a really growing area of the city, where most of these buildings that you see in the image, they were not there.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't have any connection for hundreds of meters.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, putting all the entrances of the building.
And this extends with an inclined atrium that creates an open-air space in the building that self-protects itself with its own shape from the sun and the rain.
And around this void we placed this idea of the market with small shops, that change in each floor because of the shape of the void.
I also thought, how to close the building?
And I really wanted to find a solution that would respond to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about the textile like a shell made of concrete with perforations that would let the air in, and also the light, but in a filtered way.
And then the inspiration came from these beautiful buttons of the Ethiopian women's dresses.
That they have fractal geometry properties and this helped me to shape the whole facade.
And we are building that with these small prefabricated pieces that are the windows that let the air and the light in a controlled way inside the building.
And this is complemented by these small colored glasses that use the light from the inside of the building to light up the building at night.
With these ideas it was not easy first to convince the developers because they were like, "This is not a shopping mall. We didn't ask for that."
But then we all realized that this idea of the market happened to be a lot more profitable than the idea of the shopping mall because basically they had more shops to sell.
And also that the idea of the facade was much, much cheaper, not only because of the material compared with the glass, but also because we didn't need to have air conditioning anymore.
So we created some budget savings that we used to implement the project.
And the first implementation was to think about how we could make the building self-sufficient in terms of energy in a city that has electricity cuts almost every day.
So we created a huge asset by placing photovoltaics there on the roof.
And then under those panels we thought about the roof like a new public space with gathering areas and bars that would create this urban oasis.
And these porches on the roof, all together they collect the water to reuse for sanitation on the inside.
Hopefully by the beginning of next year, because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and facilities in the city of Tunis.
And for doing such a big project, the biggest project I've ever designed, I really needed to understand the city of Tunis, but also its surroundings and the tradition and culture.
During that analysis I paid special attention to the medina that is this 1,000-year-old structure that used to be closed by a wall, opened by twelve different gates, connected by almost straight lines.
When I went to the site, the first design operation we did was to extend the existing streets, creating 12 initial blocks similar in size and characteristics to the ones we have in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these courtyards.
On top of that, we selected some strategic points reminded of this idea of the gates and connecting them by straight lines, and this modified this initial pattern.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the small cell of the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
And for that I thought, what would be the best orientation in the Mediterranean climate for an apartment?
And it's north-south, because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and then a natural ventilation.
So we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments are perfectly oriented in that direction.
And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with courtyards, and then on the ground floor you have all these connections for the pedestrians.
And also it responds to the local regulations that establish a higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor.
And it also reinforces this idea of the gates.
The volume has this connecting shape that shades itself with three different types of apartments and also lets the light go on the ground floor in a very dense neighborhood And in the courtyards there are the different facilities, such as a gym and a kindergarten and close by, a series of commercial [spaces] that bring activity to the ground floor.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving back to the community the space taken by the construction.
And it's where all the neighbors, they can go up and socialize, and do activities such as having a two-kilometer run in the morning, jumping from one building to another.
These two examples, they have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they are in emerging countries where you can see the cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives of today and tomorrow changes the local communities and economies at the same speed as the buildings grow.
For this reason, I see even more importance to look at architecture finding simple but affordable solutions that enhance the relationship between the community and the environment and that aim to connect nature and people.
Thank you very much.
I was about 10 years old on a camping trip with my dad in the Adirondack Mountains, a wilderness area in the northern part of New York State.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest was sparkling.
The sun made the leaves glow like stained glass, and if it weren't for the path we were following, we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to ever walk that land.
We got to our campsite.
It was a lean-to on a bluff looking over a crystal, beautiful lake, when I discovered a horror.
Behind the lean-to was a dump, maybe 40 feet square with rotting apple cores and balled-up aluminum foil, and a dead sneaker.
And I was astonished, I was very angry, and I was deeply confused.
The campers who were too lazy to take out what they had brought in, who did they think would clean up after them?
That question stayed with me, and it simplified a little.
Who cleans up after us?
However you configure or wherever you place the us, who cleans up after us in Istanbul?
Who cleans up after us in Rio or in Paris or in London?
Here in New York, the Department of Sanitation cleans up after us, to the tune of 11,000 tons of garbage and 2,000 tons of recyclables every day.
I wanted to get to know them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who takes the job.
What's it like to wear the uniform and bear that burden?
So I started a research project with them.
I rode in the trucks and walked the routes and interviewed people in offices and facilities all over the city, and I learned a lot, but I was still an outsider.
I needed to go deeper.
So I took the job as a sanitation worker.
I didn't just ride in the trucks now. I drove the trucks.
And I operated the mechanical brooms and I plowed the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education.
Everyone asks about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you think, and on days when it is really bad, you get used to it rather quickly.
The weight takes a long time to get used to.
I knew people who were several years on the job whose bodies were still adjusting to the burden of bearing on your body tons of trash every week.
Then there's the danger.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, sanitation work is one of the 10 most dangerous occupations in the country, and I learned why.
You're in and out of traffic all day, and it's zooming around you.
It just wants to get past you, so it's often the motorist is not paying attention.
That's really bad for the worker.
And then the garbage itself is full of hazards that often fly back out of the truck and do terrible harm.
I also learned about the relentlessness of trash.
When you step off the curb and you see a city from behind a truck, you come to understand that trash is like a force of nature unto itself.
It never stops coming.
It's also like a form of respiration or circulation.
It must always be in motion.
And then there's the stigma.
You put on the uniform, and you become invisible until someone is upset with you for whatever reason like you've blocked traffic with your truck, or you're taking a break too close to their home, or you're drinking coffee in their diner, and they will come and scorn you, and tell you that they don't want you anywhere near them.
I find the stigma especially ironic, because I strongly believe that sanitation workers are the most important labor force on the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They are the first guardians of public health.
If they're not taking away trash efficiently and effectively every day, it starts to spill out of its containments, and the dangers inherent to it threaten us in very real ways.
Diseases we've had in check for decades and centuries burst forth again and start to harm us.
The economy needs them.
If we can't throw out the old stuff, we have no room for the new stuff, so then the engines of the economy start to sputter when consumption is compromised.
I'm not advocating capitalism, I'm just pointing out their relationship.
And then there's what I call our average, necessary quotidian velocity.
By that I simply mean how fast we're used to moving in the contemporary day and age.
We usually don't care for, repair, clean, carry around our coffee cup, our shopping bag, our bottle of water.
We use them, we throw them out, we forget about them, because we know there's a workforce on the other side that's going to take it all away.
So I want to suggest today a couple of ways to think about sanitation that will perhaps help ameliorate the stigma and bring them into this conversation of how to craft a city that is sustainable and humane.
Their work, I think, is kind of liturgical.
They're on the streets every day, rhythmically.
They wear a uniform in many cities.
You know when to expect them.
And their work lets us do our work.
They are almost a form of reassurance.
The flow that they maintain keeps us safe from ourselves, from our own dross, our cast-offs, and that flow must be maintained always no matter what.
On the day after September 11 in 2001, I heard the growl of a sanitation truck on the street, and I grabbed my infant son and I ran downstairs and there was a man doing his paper recycling route like he did every Wednesday.
And I tried to thank him for doing his work on that day of all days, but I started to cry.
And he looked at me, and he just nodded, and he said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be okay."
It was a little while later that I started my research with sanitation, and I met that man again.
His name is Paulie, and we worked together many times, and we became good friends.
I want to believe that Paulie was right.
We are going to be okay.
But in our effort to reconfigure how we as a species exist on this planet, we must include and take account of all the costs, including the very real human cost of the labor.
And we also would be well informed to reach out to the people who do that work and get their expertise on how do we think about, how do we create systems around sustainability that perhaps take us from curbside recycling, which is a remarkable success across 40 years, across the United States and countries around the world, and lift us up to a broader horizon where we're looking at other forms of waste that could be lessened from manufacturing and industrial sources.
Municipal waste, what we think of when we talk about garbage, accounts for three percent of the nation's waste stream.
It's a remarkable statistic.
So in the flow of your days, in the flow of your lives, next time you see someone whose job is to clean up after you, take a moment to acknowledge them.
Take a moment to say thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very demanding job in management consulting for a job that was even more demanding: teaching.
I went to teach seventh graders math in the New York City public schools.
And like any teacher, I made quizzes and tests.
I gave out homework assignments.
When the work came back, I calculated grades.
What struck me was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of my strongest performers did not have stratospheric I.Q. scores.
Some of my smartest kids weren't doing so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math, sure, they're hard: ratios, decimals, the area of a parallelogram.
But these concepts are not impossible, and I was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough.
After several more years of teaching, I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the one thing we know how to measure best is I.Q., but what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily?
So I left the classroom, and I went to graduate school to become a psychologist.
I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings, and in every study my question was, who is successful here and why?
My research team and I went to West Point Military Academy.
We tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training and which would drop out.
We went to the National Spelling Bee and tried to predict which children would advance farthest in competition.
We studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods, asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year, and of those, who will be the most effective at improving learning outcomes for their students?
We partnered with private companies, asking, which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs?
And who's going to earn the most money?
In all those very different contexts, one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't good looks, physical health, and it wasn't I.Q.
It was grit.
Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals.
Grit is having stamina.
Grit is sticking with your future, day in, day out, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality.
Grit is living life like it's a marathon, not a sprint.
A few years ago, I started studying grit in the Chicago public schools.
I asked thousands of high school juniors to take grit questionnaires, and then waited around more than a year to see who would graduate.
Turns out that grittier kids were significantly more likely to graduate, even when I matched them on every characteristic I could measure, things like family income, standardized achievement test scores, even how safe kids felt when they were at school.
So it's not just at West Point or the National Spelling Bee that grit matters. It's also in school, especially for kids at risk for dropping out.
To me, the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know, how little science knows, about building it.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do I build grit in kids?
What do I do to teach kids a solid work ethic?
How do I keep them motivated for the long run?"
The honest answer is, I don't know.
What I do know is that talent doesn't make you gritty.
Our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commitments.
In fact, in our data, grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to measures of talent.
So far, the best idea I've heard about building grit in kids is something called "growth mindset."
This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol Dweck, and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with your effort.
Dr. Dweck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge, they're much more likely to persevere when they fail, because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition.
So growth mindset is a great idea for building grit.
But we need more.
And that's where I'm going to end my remarks, because that's where we are.
That's the work that stands before us.
We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions, and we need to test them.
We need to measure whether we've been successful, and we have to be willing to fail, to be wrong, to start over again with lessons learned.
In other words, we need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier.
Thank you.
When I was a child growing up in Maine, one of my favorite things to do was to look for sand dollars on the seashores of Maine, because my parents told me it would bring me luck.
But you know, these shells, they're hard to find.
They're covered in sand. They're difficult to see.
However, overtime, I got used to looking for them.
I started seeing shapes and patterns that helped me to collect them.
This grew into a passion for finding things, a love for the past and archaeology.
And eventually when I started studying Egyptology, I realized that seeing with my naked eyes alone wasn't enough.
Because all of the sudden in Egypt my beach had grown from a tiny beach in Maine to one eight hundred miles long next to the Nile, and my sand dollars had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what brought me to using satellite imagery.
For trying to map the past, I knew that I had to see differently.
So I want to show you an example of how we see differently using the infrared.
This is a site located in the eastern Egyptian delta called Bendix.
And the site visibly appears brown, but when we use the infrared and we process it, all of the sudden, using false color, the site appears as bright pink.
What you are seeing are the actual chemical changes to the landscape caused by the building materials and activities of the ancient Egyptians.
What I want to share with you today is how we've used satellite data to find an ancient Egyptian city, called Itjtawy, missing for thousands of years.
Itjtawy was ancient Egypt's capital for over four hundred years, at a period of time called the Middle Kingdom about four thousand years ago.
The site is located in the Faiyum of Egypt and site is really important because in the Middle Kingdom there was this great renaissance for ancient Egyptian art, architecture and religion.
Egyptologists have always known the site of Itjtawy was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings who built it, indicated within the red circles here, but somewhere within this massive flood plane.
This area is huge -- it's four miles by three miles in size.
The Nile used to flow right next to the city of Itjtawy, and as it shifted and changed and moved over time to the east, it covered over the city.
So, how do you find a buried city in a vast landscape?
Finding it randomly would be the equivalent of locating a needle in a haystack, blindfolded wearing baseball mitts.
So what we did is we used NASA topography data to map out the landscape, very subtle changes.
We started to be able to see where the Nile used to flow.
But you can see in more detail -- and even more interesting -- this very slight raised area seen within the circle up here, which we thought could possibly be the location of the city of Itjtawy.
So we collaborated with the Egyptian scientists to do coring work, which you see here.
When I say coring, it's like ice coring, but instead of layers of climate change you're looking for layers of human occupation.
And five meters down, underneath a thick layer of mud, we found a dense layer of pottery.
What this shows is that at this possible location of Itjtawy, five meters down, we have of layer of occupation for several hundred years dating to the Middle Kingdom, dating to the exact period of time we think Itjtawy is.
We also found work stone -- carnelian, quartz and agate that shows that there was a jewelers workshop here.
These might not look like much, but when you think about the most common stones used in jewelry from the Middle Kingdom, these are the stones that were used.
So, we have a dense layer of occupation dating to the Middle Kingdom at this site.
We also have evidence of an elite jewelers workshop, showing that whatever was there was a very important city.
No Itjtawy was here yet, but we're going to be returning to the site in the near future to map it out.
And even more importantly, we have funding to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so they can be the ones making great discoveries as well.
So I wanted to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Kingdom -- it was probably written at the city of Itjtawy four thousand years ago.
"Sharing knowledge is the greatest of all callings.
There's nothing like it in the land."
So as it turns out, TED was not founded in 1984 AD.
Making ideas actually started in 1984 BC at a not-lost-for-long city, found from above.
It certainly puts finding seashells by the seashore in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I would like to talk to you about a story about a small town kid.
I don't know his name, but I do know his story.
He lives in a small village in southern Somalia.
His village is near Mogadishu.
Drought drives the small village into poverty and to the brink of starvation.
With nothing left for him there, he leaves for the big city, in this case, Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia.
When he arrives, there are no opportunities, no jobs, no way forward.
He ends up living in a tent city on the outskirts of Mogadishu.
Maybe a year passes, nothing.
One day, he's approached by a gentleman who offers to take him to lunch, then to dinner, to breakfast.
He meets this dynamic group of people, and they give him a break.
He's given a bit of money to buy himself some new clothes, money to send back home to his family.
He is introduced to this young woman.
He eventually gets married.
He starts this new life.
He has a purpose in life.
One beautiful day in Mogadishu, under an azure blue sky, a car bomb goes off.
That small town kid with the big city dreams was the suicide bomber, and that dynamic group of people were al Shabaab, a terrorist organization linked to al Qaeda.
So how does the story of a small town kid just trying to make it big in the city end up with him blowing himself up?
He was waiting.
He was waiting for an opportunity, waiting to begin his future, waiting for a way forward, and this was the first thing that came along.
This was the first thing that pulled him out of what we call waithood.
And his story repeats itself in urban centers around the world.
It is the story of the disenfranchised, unemployed urban youth who sparks riots in Johannesburg, sparks riots in London, who reaches out for something other than waithood.
For young people, the promise of the city, the big city dream is that of opportunity, of jobs, of wealth, but young people are not sharing in the prosperity of their cities.
Often it's youth who suffer from the highest unemployment rates.
By 2030, three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of 18.
If we do not include young people in the growth of our cities, if we do not provide them opportunities, the story of waithood, the gateway to terrorism, to violence, to gangs, will be the story of cities 2.0.
And in my city of birth, Mogadishu, 70 percent of young people suffer from unemployment.
70 percent don't work, don't go to school.
They pretty much do nothing.
I went back to Mogadishu last month, and I went to visit Madina Hospital, the hospital I was born in.
I remember standing in front of that bullet-ridden hospital thinking, what if I had never left?
What if I had been forced into that same state of waithood?
Would I have become a terrorist?
I'm not really sure about the answer.
My reason for being in Mogadishu that month was actually to host a youth leadership and entrepreneurship summit.
I brought together about 90 young Somali leaders.
We sat down and brainstormed on solutions to the biggest challenges facing their city.
One of the young men in the room was Aden.
He went to university in Mogadishu, graduated.
There were no jobs, no opportunities.
I remember him telling me, because he was a college graduate, unemployed, frustrated, that he was the perfect target for al Shabaab and other terrorist organizations, to be recruited.
They sought people like him out.
But his story takes a different route.
In Mogadishu, the biggest barrier to getting from point A to point B are the roads.
Twenty-three years of civil war have completely destroyed the road system, and a motorbike can be the easiest way to get around.
Aden saw an opportunity and seized it.
He started a motorbike company.
He began renting out motorbikes to local residents who couldn't normally afford them.
He bought 10 bikes, with the help of family and friends, and his dream is to eventually expand to several hundred within the next three years.
How is this story different?
What makes his story different?
I believe it is his ability to identify and seize a new opportunity.
It's entrepreneurship, and I believe entrepreneurship can be the most powerful tool against waithood.
It empowers young people to be the creators of the very economic opportunities they are so desperately seeking.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed Mohamoud, a florist.
He was helping me train some of the young people at the summit in entrepreneurship and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of entrepreneurship.
He's actually the first florist Mogadishu has seen in over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed came along, if you wanted flowers at your wedding, you used plastic bouquets shipped from abroad.
If you asked someone, "When was the last time you saw fresh flowers?" for many who grew up under civil war, the answer would be, "Never."
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a landscaping and design floral company.
He created a farm right outside of Mogadishu, and started growing tulips and lilies, which he said could survive the harsh Mogadishu climate.
And he began delivering flowers to weddings, creating gardens at homes and businesses around the city, and he's now working on creating Mogadishu's first public park in 22 years.
There's no public park in Mogadishu.
He wants to create a space where families, young people, can come together, and, as he says, smell the proverbial roses.
And he doesn't grow roses because they use too much water, by the way.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, Mohamed's presence had a really profound impact on the youth in that room.
They had never really thought about starting up a business.
They've thought about working for an NGO, working for the government, but his story, his innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
He empowered them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that they could be change makers.
By the end of the day, they were coming up with innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing their city.
They came up with entrepreneurial solutions to local problems.
So inspiring young people and creating a culture of entrepreneurship is a really great step, but young people need capital to make their ideas a reality.
They need expertise and mentorship to guide them in developing and launching their businesses.
Connect young people with the resources they need, provide them the support they need to go from ideation to creation, and you will create catalysts for urban growth.
For me, entrepreneurship is more than just starting up a business.
It's about creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.
I believe he is selling hope.
His Peace Park, and that's what he calls it, when it's created, will actually transform the way people see their city.
Aden hired street kids to help rent out and maintain those bikes for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of waithood.
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities.
So my suggestion is, turn youth into entrepreneurs, incubate and nurture their inherent innovation, and you will have more stories of flowers and Peace Parks than of car bombs and waithood.
Thank you.
Growing up in Taiwan as the daughter of a calligrapher, one of my most treasured memories was my mother showing me the beauty, the shape and the form of Chinese characters.
Ever since then, I was fascinated by this incredible language.
But to an outsider, it seems to be as impenetrable as the Great Wall of China.
Over the past few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this wall, so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so.
I started thinking about how a new, fast method of learning Chinese might be useful.
Since the age of five, I started to learn how to draw every single stroke for each character in the correct sequence.
I learned new characters every day during the course of the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better that we have a fast and simpler way.
A Chinese scholar would understand 20,000 characters.
You only need 1,000 to understand the basic literacy.
The top 200 will allow you to comprehend 40 percent of basic literature -- enough to read road signs, restaurant menus, to understand the basic idea of the web pages or the newspapers.
Today I'm going to start with eight to show you how the method works.
You are ready?
Open your mouth as wide as possible until it's square.
You get a mouth.
This is a person going for a walk.
Person.
If the shape of the fire is a person with two arms on both sides, as if she was yelling frantically, "Help! I'm on fire!" -- This symbol actually is originally from the shape of the flame, but I like to think that way. Whichever works for you.
This is a tree.
Tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west.
I call these eight characters radicals.
They are the building blocks for you to create lots more characters.
A person.
If someone walks behind, that is "to follow."
As the old saying goes, two is company, three is a crowd.
If a person stretched their arms wide, this person is saying, "It was this big."
The person inside the mouth, the person is trapped.
He's a prisoner, just like Jonah inside the whale.
One tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have the woods.
Three trees together, we create the forest.
Put a plank underneath the tree, we have the foundation.
Put a mouth on the top of the tree, that's "idiot."
Easy to remember, since a talking tree is pretty idiotic.
Remember fire?
Two fires together, I get really hot.
Three fires together, that's a lot of flames.
Set the fire underneath the two trees, it's burning.
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two suns together, prosperous.
Three together, that's sparkles.
Put the sun and the moon shining together, it's brightness.
It also means tomorrow, after a day and a night.
The sun is coming up above the horizon. Sunrise.
A door. Put a plank inside the door, it's a door bolt.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
Knock knock. Is anyone home?
This person is sneaking out of a door, escaping, evading.
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they have an argument.
Three women together, be careful, it's adultery.
So we have gone through almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radicals will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build an extra 32.
So with very little effort, you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters, which is the same as a Chinese eight-year-old.
So after we know the characters, we start building phrases.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have fire mountain. It's a volcano.
We know Japan is the land of the rising sun.
This is a sun placed with the origin, because Japan lies to the east of China.
So a sun, origin together, we build Japan.
A person behind Japan, what do we get?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains stacked on top of each other.
In ancient China, that means in exile, because Chinese emperors, they put their political enemies in exile beyond mountains.
Nowadays, exile has turned into getting out.
A mouth which tells you where to get out is an exit.
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and get off of the stage. Thank you.
When I was in my 20s, I saw my very first psychotherapy client.
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley.
She was a 26-year-old woman named Alex.
Now Alex walked into her first session wearing jeans and a big slouchy top, and she dropped onto the couch in my office and kicked off her flats and told me she was there to talk about guy problems.
Now when I heard this, I was so relieved.
My classmate got an arsonist for her first client.
And I got a twentysomething who wanted to talk about boys.
This I thought I could handle.
But I didn't handle it.
With the funny stories that Alex would bring to session, it was easy for me just to nod my head while we kicked the can down the road.
"Thirty's the new 20," Alex would say, and as far as I could tell, she was right.
Work happened later, marriage happened later, kids happened later, even death happened later.
Twentysomethings like Alex and I had nothing but time.
But before long, my supervisor pushed me to push Alex about her love life.
I pushed back.
I said, "Sure, she's dating down, she's sleeping with a knucklehead, but it's not like she's going to marry the guy."
And then my supervisor said, "Not yet, but she might marry the next one.
Besides, the best time to work on Alex's marriage is before she has one."
That's what psychologists call an "Aha!" moment.
That was the moment I realized, 30 is not the new 20.
Yes, people settle down later than they used to, but that didn't make Alex's 20s a developmental downtime.
That made Alex's 20s a developmental sweet spot, and we were sitting there blowing it.
That was when I realized that this sort of benign neglect was a real problem, and it had real consequences, not just for Alex and her love life but for the careers and the families and the futures of twentysomethings everywhere.
There are 50 million twentysomethings in the United States right now.
We're talking about 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you consider that no one's getting through adulthood without going through their 20s first.
Raise your hand if you're in your 20s.
I really want to see some twentysomethings here.
Oh, yay! Y'all's awesome.
If you work with twentysomethings, you love a twentysomething, you're losing sleep over twentysomethings, I want to see — Okay. Awesome, twentysomethings really matter.
So I specialize in twentysomethings because I believe that every single one of those 50 million twentysomethings deserves to know what psychologists, sociologists, neurologists and fertility specialists already know: that claiming your 20s is one of the simplest, yet most transformative, things you can do for work, for love, for your happiness, maybe even for the world.
This is not my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of life's most defining moments take place by age 35.
That means that eight out of 10 of the decisions and experiences and "Aha!" moments that make your life what it is will have happened by your mid-30s.
People who are over 40, don't panic.
This crowd is going to be fine, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on how much money you're going to earn.
We know that more than half of Americans are married or are living with or dating their future partner by 30.
We know that the brain caps off its second and last growth spurt in your 20s as it rewires itself for adulthood, which means that whatever it is you want to change about yourself, now is the time to change it.
We know that personality changes more during your 20s than at any other time in life, and we know that female fertility peaks at age 28, and things get tricky after age 35.
So your 20s are the time to educate yourself about your body and your options.
So when we think about child development, we all know that the first five years are a critical period for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a time when your ordinary, day-to-day life has an inordinate impact on who you will become.
But what we hear less about is that there's such a thing as adult development, and our 20s are that critical period of adult development.
But this isn't what twentysomethings are hearing.
Newspapers talk about the changing timetable of adulthood.
Researchers call the 20s an extended adolescence.
Journalists coin silly nicknames for twentysomethings like "twixters" and "kidults."
It's true.
As a culture, we have trivialized what is actually the defining decade of adulthood.
Leonard Bernstein said that to achieve great things, you need a plan and not quite enough time.
Isn't that true?
So what do you think happens when you pat a twentysomething on the head and you say, "You have 10 extra years to start your life"?
Nothing happens.
You have robbed that person of his urgency and ambition, and absolutely nothing happens.
And then every day, smart, interesting twentysomethings like you or like your sons and daughters come into my office and say things like this: "I know my boyfriend's no good for me, but this relationship doesn't count. I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says as long as I get started on a career by the time I'm 30, I'll be fine."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My 20s are almost over, and I have nothing to show for myself.
I had a better résumé the day after I graduated from college."
And then it starts to sound like this: "Dating in my 20s was like musical chairs.
Everybody was running around and having fun, but then sometime around 30 it was like the music turned off and everybody started sitting down.
I didn't want to be the only one left standing up, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the closest chair to me at 30."
Where are the twentysomethings here?
Do not do that.
Okay, now that sounds a little flip, but make no mistake, the stakes are very high.
When a lot has been pushed to your 30s, there is enormous thirtysomething pressure to jump-start a career, pick a city, partner up, and have two or three kids in a much shorter period of time.
Many of these things are incompatible, and as research is just starting to show, simply harder and more stressful to do all at once in our 30s.
The post-millennial midlife crisis isn't buying a red sports car.
It's realizing you can't have that career you now want.
It's realizing you can't have that child you now want, or you can't give your child a sibling.
Too many thirtysomethings and fortysomethings look at themselves, and at me, sitting across the room, and say about their 20s, "What was I doing? What was I thinking?"
I want to change what twentysomethings are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how that can go.
It's a story about a woman named Emma.
At 25, Emma came to my office because she was, in her words, having an identity crisis.
She said she thought she might like to work in art or entertainment, but she hadn't decided yet, so she'd spent the last few years waiting tables instead.
Because it was cheaper, she lived with a boyfriend who displayed his temper more than his ambition.
And as hard as her 20s were, her early life had been even harder.
She often cried in our sessions, but then would collect herself by saying, "You can't pick your family, but you can pick your friends."
Well one day, Emma comes in and she hangs her head in her lap, and she sobbed for most of the hour.
She'd just bought a new address book, and she'd spent the morning filling in her many contacts, but then she'd been left staring at that empty blank that comes after the words "In case of emergency, please call ... ."
She was nearly hysterical when she looked at me and said, "Who's going to be there for me if I get in a car wreck?
Who's going to take care of me if I have cancer?"
Now in that moment, it took everything I had not to say, "I will."
But what Emma needed wasn't some therapist who really, really cared.
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was her chance.
I had learned too much since I first worked with Alex to just sit there while Emma's defining decade went parading by.
So over the next weeks and months, I told Emma three things that every twentysomething, male or female, deserves to hear.
First, I told Emma to forget about having an identity crisis and get some identity capital.
By get identity capital, I mean do something that adds value to who you are.
Do something that's an investment in who you might want to be next.
I didn't know the future of Emma's career, and no one knows the future of work, but I do know this: Identity capital begets identity capital.
So now is the time for that cross-country job, that internship, that startup you want to try.
I'm not discounting twentysomething exploration here, but I am discounting exploration that's not supposed to count, which, by the way, is not exploration.
That's procrastination.
I told Emma to explore work and make it count.
Second, I told Emma that the urban tribe is overrated.
Best friends are great for giving rides to the airport, but twentysomethings who huddle together with like-minded peers limit who they know, what they know, how they think, how they speak, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person to date almost always comes from outside the inner circle.
New things come from what are called our weak ties, our friends of friends of friends.
So yes, half of twentysomethings are un- or under-employed.
But half aren't, and weak ties are how you get yourself into that group.
Half of new jobs are never posted, so reaching out to your neighbor's boss is how you get that un-posted job.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information spreads.
Last but not least, Emma believed that you can't pick your family, but you can pick your friends.
Now this was true for her growing up, but as a twentysomething, soon Emma would pick her family when she partnered with someone and created a family of her own.
I told Emma the time to start picking your family is now.
Now you may be thinking that 30 is actually a better time to settle down than 20, or even 25, and I agree with you.
But grabbing whoever you're living with or sleeping with when everyone on Facebook starts walking down the aisle is not progress.
The best time to work on your marriage is before you have one, and that means being as intentional with love as you are with work.
Picking your family is about consciously choosing who and what you want rather than just making it work or killing time with whoever happens to be choosing you.
So what happened to Emma?
Well, we went through that address book, and she found an old roommate's cousin who worked at an art museum in another state.
That weak tie helped her get a job there.
That job offer gave her the reason to leave that live-in boyfriend.
Now, five years later, she's a special events planner for museums.
She's married to a man she mindfully chose.
She loves her new career, she loves her new family, and she sent me a card that said, "Now the emergency contact blanks don't seem big enough."
Now Emma's story made that sound easy, but that's what I love about working with twentysomethings.
They are so easy to help.
Twentysomethings are like airplanes just leaving LAX, bound for somewhere west.
Right after takeoff, a slight change in course is the difference between landing in Alaska or Fiji.
Likewise, at 21 or 25 or even 29, one good conversation, one good break, one good TED Talk, can have an enormous effect across years and even generations to come.
So here's an idea worth spreading to every twentysomething you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to Alex.
It's what I now have the privilege of saying to twentysomethings like Emma every single day: Thirty is not the new 20, so claim your adulthood, get some identity capital, use your weak ties, pick your family.
Don't be defined by what you didn't know or didn't do.
You're deciding your life right now.
Thank you.
I recently retired from the California Highway Patrol after 23 years of service.
The majority of those 23 years was spent patrolling the southern end of Marin County, which includes the Golden Gate Bridge.
The bridge is an iconic structure, known worldwide for its beautiful views of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean, and its inspiring architecture.
Unfortunately, it is also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most utilized sites in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge opened in 1937.
Joseph Strauss, chief engineer in charge of building the bridge, was quoted as saying, "The bridge is practically suicide-proof.
Suicide from the bridge is neither practical nor probable."
But since its opening, over 1,600 people have leapt to their death from that bridge.
Some believe that traveling between the two towers will lead you to another dimension -- this bridge has been romanticized as such — that the fall from that frees you from all your worries and grief, and the waters below will cleanse your soul.
But let me tell you what actually occurs when the bridge is used as a means of suicide.
That impact shatters bones, some of which then puncture vital organs.
Most die on impact.
Those that don't generally flail in the water helplessly, and then drown.
I don't think that those who contemplate this method of suicide realize how grisly a death that they will face.
This is the cord.
Except for around the two towers, there is 32 inches of steel paralleling the bridge.
This is where most folks stand before taking their lives.
I can tell you from experience that once the person is on that cord, and at their darkest time, it is very difficult to bring them back.
I took this photo last year as this young woman spoke to an officer contemplating her life.
I want to tell you very happily that we were successful that day in getting her back over the rail.
When I first began working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
You struggled to funnel your way through these calls.
This was not only a disservice to those contemplating suicide, but to the officers as well.
We've come a long, long way since then.
Now, veteran officers and psychologists train new officers.
This is Jason Garber.
I met Jason on July 22 of last year when I get received a call of a possible suicidal subject sitting on the cord near midspan.
I responded, and when I arrived, I observed Jason speaking to a Golden Gate Bridge officer.
Jason was just 32 years old and had flown out here from New Jersey.
After about an hour of speaking with Jason, he asked us if we knew the story of Pandora's box.
Recalling your Greek mythology, Zeus created Pandora, and sent her down to Earth with a box, and told her, "Never, ever open that box."
Well one day, curiosity got the better of Pandora, and she did open the box.
Out flew plagues, sorrows, and all sorts of evils against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
Jason then asked us, "What happens when you open the box and hope isn't there?"
He paused a few moments, leaned to his right, and was gone.
This kind, intelligent young man from New Jersey had just committed suicide.
I spoke with Jason's parents that evening, and I suppose that, when I was speaking with them, that I didn't sound as if I was doing very well, because that very next day, their family rabbi called to check on me.
Jason's parents had asked him to do so.
The collateral damage of suicide affects so many people.
I pose these questions to you: What would you do if your family member, friend or loved one was suicidal?
What would you say?
Would you know what to say?
In my experience, it's not just the talking that you do, but the listening.
Listen to understand.
Don't argue, blame, or tell the person you know how they feel, because you probably don't.
By just being there, you may just be the turning point that they need.
If you think someone is suicidal, don't be afraid to confront them and ask the question.
One way of asking them the question is like this: "Others in similar circumstances have thought about ending their life; have you had these thoughts?"
Confronting the person head-on may just save their life and be the turning point for them.
Some other signs to look for: hopelessness, believing that things are terrible and never going to get better; helplessness, believing that there is nothing that you can do about it; recent social withdrawal; and a loss of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I received an email from a lady that I'd like to read you her letter.
She lost her son on January 19 of this year, and she wrote this me this email just a couple of days ago, and it's with her permission and blessing that I read this to you.
"Hi, Kevin. I imagine you're at the TED Conference.
That must be quite the experience to be there.
I'm thinking I should go walk the bridge this weekend.
Just wanted to drop you a note.
Hope you get the word out to many people and they go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends, etc.
I'm still pretty numb, but noticing more moments of really realizing Mike isn't coming home.
Mike was driving from Petaluma to San Francisco to watch the 49ers game with his father on January 19.
He never made it there.
I called Petaluma police and reported him missing that evening.
The next morning, two officers came to my home and reported that Mike's car was down at the bridge.
A witness had observed him jumping off the bridge at 1:58 p.m. the previous day.
Thanks so much for standing up for those who may be only temporarily too weak to stand for themselves.
Who hasn't been low before without suffering from a true mental illness?
It shouldn't be so easy to end it.
My prayers are with you for your fight.
The GGB, Golden Gate Bridge, is supposed to be a passage across our beautiful bay, not a graveyard.
Good luck this week. Vicky."
I can't imagine the courage it takes for her to go down to that bridge and walk the path that her son took that day, and also the courage just to carry on.
I'd like to introduce you to a man I refer to as hope and courage.
On March 11 of 2005, I responded to a radio call of a possible suicidal subject on the bridge sidewalk near the north tower.
I rode my motorcycle down the sidewalk and observed this man, Kevin Berthia, standing on the sidewalk.
For the next hour and a half, I listened as Kevin spoke about his depression and hopelessness.
Kevin decided on his own that day to come back over that rail and give life another chance.
When Kevin came back over, I congratulated him.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was it that made you come back and give hope and life another chance?"
And you know what he told me?
He said, "You listened.
You let me speak, and you just listened."
Shortly after this incident, I received a letter from Kevin's mother, and I have that letter with me, and I'd like to read it to you.
"Dear Mr. Briggs, Nothing will erase the events of March 11, but you are one of the reasons Kevin is still with us.
I truly believe Kevin was crying out for help.
He has been diagnosed with a mental illness for which he has been properly medicated.
I adopted Kevin when he was only six months old, completely unaware of any hereditary traits, but, thank God, now we know.
Kevin is straight, as he says.
We truly thank God for you.
Sincerely indebted to you, Narvella Berthia."
And on the bottom she writes, "P.S. When I visited San Francisco General Hospital that evening, you were listed as the patient.
Boy, did I have to straighten that one out."
Today, Kevin is a loving father and contributing member of society.
He speaks openly about the events that day and his depression in the hopes that his story will inspire others.
Suicide is not just something I've encountered on the job.
It's personal.
My grandfather committed suicide by poisoning.
That act, although ending his own pain, robbed me from ever getting to know him.
This is what suicide does.
For most suicidal folks, or those contemplating suicide, they wouldn't think of hurting another person.
They just want their own pain to end.
Typically, this is accomplished in just three ways: sleep, drugs or alcohol, or death.
In my career, I've responded to and been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge.
Of those incidents I've been directly involved with, I've only lost two, but that's two too many.
One was Jason.
The other was a man I spoke to for about an hour.
During that time, he shook my hand on three occasions.
On that final handshake, he looked at me, and he said, "Kevin, I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And he leapt.
I do want to tell you, though, the vast majority of folks that we do get to contact on that bridge do not commit suicide.
Additionally, that very few who have jumped off the bridge and lived and can talk about it, that one to two percent, most of those folks have said that the second that they let go of that rail, they knew that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge not only connects Marin to San Francisco, but people together also.
That connection, or bridge that we make, is something that each and every one of us should strive to do.
Suicide is preventable.
There is help. There is hope.
Thank you very much.
What do augmented reality and professional football have to do with empathy?
And what is the air speed velocity of an unladen swallow?
Now unfortunately, I'm only going to answer one of those questions today, so please, try and contain your disappointment.
When most people think about augmented reality, they think about "Minority Report" and Tom Cruise waving his hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
Augmented reality is something that will happen in our lifetime, and it will happen because we have the tools to make it happen, and people need to be aware of that, because augmented reality will change our lives just as much as the Internet and the cell phone.
Now how do we get to augmented reality?
Step one is the step I'm wearing right now, Google Glass.
I'm sure many of you are familiar with Google Glass.
What you may not be familiar with is that Google Glass is a device that will allow you to see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what it is like to be a professional athlete on the field.
Right now, the only way you can be on the field is for me to try and describe it to you.
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you then fill in with your imagination.
With Google Glass, we can put that underneath a helmet, and we can get a sense of what it's like to be running down the field at 100 miles an hour, your blood pounding in your ears.
You can get a sense of what it's like to have a 250-pound man sprinting at you trying to decapitate you with every ounce of his being.
And I've been on the receiving end of that, and it doesn't feel very good.
So let's pull up some video.
Go.
Ugh, getting tackled sucks.
Hold on, let's get a little closer.
All right, ready?
Go!
Now, you may have noticed there are some people missing there: the rest of the team.
We have some video of that courtesy of the University of Washington.
Quarterback: Hey, Mice 54! Mice 54!
Blue 8! Blue 8! Go!
Oh!
Fans want that experience.
Fans want to be on that field.
They want to be their favorite players, and they've already talked to me on YouTube, they've talked to me on Twitter, saying, "Hey, can you get this on a quarterback?
Well, once we have that experience with GoPro and Google Glass, how do we make it more immersive?
How do we take that next step?
The Oculus Rift has been described as one of the most realistic virtual reality devices ever created, and that is not empty hype.
I'm going to show you why that is not empty hype with this video.
Oh! Oh!
No! No! No! I don't want to play anymore! No!
Oh my God! Aaaah!
So that is the experience of a man on a roller coaster in fear of his life.
What do you think his experience is going to be when he is going down the side of a mountain at over 70 miles an hour as an Olympic downhill skier?
I think adult diaper sales may surge.
But this is not yet augmented reality.
This is only virtual reality, V.R.
How do we get to augmented reality, A.R.?
We get to augmented reality when coaches and managers and owners look at this information streaming in that people want to see, and they say, "How do we use this to make our teams better?
How do we use this to win games?"
Because teams always use technology to win games.
They like winning. It makes them money.
So a brief history of technology in the NFL.
In 1965, the Baltimore Colts put a wristband on their quarterback to allow him to call plays quicker.
They ended up winning a Super Bowl that year.
Other teams followed suit.
More people watched the game because it was more exciting.
It was faster.
In 1994, the NFL put helmet radios into the helmets of the quarterbacks, and later the defense.
More people watched games because it was faster.
It was more entertaining.
In 2023, imagine you're a player walking back to the huddle, and you have your next play displayed right in front of your face on your clear plastic visor that you already wear right now.
No more having to worry about forgetting plays.
No more worrying about having to memorize your playbook.
You just go out and react.
And coaches really want this, because missed assignments lose you games, and coaches hate losing games.
Losing games gets you fired as a coach.
They don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just an enhanced playbook.
Augmented reality is also a way to take all that data and use it in real time to enhance how you play the game.
What would that be like?
Well, a very simple setup would be a camera on each corner of the stadium looking down, giving you a bird's-eye view of all the people down there.
You also have information from helmet sensors and accelerometers, technology that's being worked on right now.
You take all that information, and you stream it to your players.
The good teams stream it in a way that the players can use.
The bad ones have information overload.
That determines good teams from bad.
And now, your I.T. department is just as important as your scouting department, and data-mining is not for nerds anymore.
It's also for jocks. Who knew?
What would that look like on the field?
Well, imagine you're the quarterback.
You take the snap and you drop back.
You're scanning downfield for an open receiver.
All of a sudden, a bright flash on the left side of your visor lets you know, blind side linebacker is blitzing in.
Normally, you wouldn't be able to see him, but the augmented reality system lets you know.
You step up into the pocket.
Another flash alerts you to an open receiver.
You throw the ball, but you're hit right as you throw.
The ball comes off track.
You don't know where it's going to land.
However, on the receiver's visor, he sees a patch of grass light up, and he knows to readjust.
He goes, catches the ball, sprints in, touchdown.
Crowd goes wild, and the fans are with him every step of the way, watching from every perspective.
Now this is something that will create massive excitement in the game.
It will make tons of people watch, because people want this experience.
Fans want to be on the field.
They want to be their favorite player.
Augmented reality will be a part of sports, because it's too profitable not to.
But the question I ask you is, is that's all that we're content to use augmented reality for?
Are we going to use it solely for our panem, our circenses, our entertainment as normal?
Because I believe that we can use augmented reality for something more.
I believe we can use augmented reality as a way to foster more empathy within the human species itself, by literally showing someone what it looks like to walk a mile in another person's shoes.
We know what this technology is worth to sports leagues.
It's worth revenue, to the tune of billions of dollars a year.
What is this technology worth to a gay Ugandan or Russian trying to show the world what it's like living under persecution?
What is this technology worth to a Commander Hadfield or a Neil deGrasse Tyson trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science instead of quarterly reports and Kardashians?
Ladies and gentlemen, augmented reality is coming.
The questions we ask, the choices we make, and the challenges we face are, as always, up to us.
Thank you.
So I was trained to become a gymnast for two years in Hunan, China in the 1970s.
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes, all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become an engineer like them.
After surviving the Cultural Revolution, they firmly believed there's only one sure way to happiness: a safe and well-paid job.
It is not important if I like the job or not.
But my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer.
That is me playing my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start training young to learn acrobatics, so I tried everything I could to go to opera school.
I even wrote to the school principal and the host of a radio show.
But no adults liked the idea.
No adults believed I was serious.
Only my friends supported me, but they were kids, just as powerless as I was.
So at age 15, I knew I was too old to be trained.
My dream would never come true.
I was afraid that for the rest of my life some second-class happiness would be the best I could hope for.
But that's so unfair.
So I was determined to find another calling.
Nobody around to teach me? Fine.
I turned to books.
I satisfied my hunger for parental advice from this book by a family of writers and musicians.["Correspondence in the Family of Fou Lei"] I found my role model of an independent woman when Confucian tradition requires obedience.["Jane Eyre"] And I learned to be efficient from this book.["Cheaper by the Dozen"] And I was inspired to study abroad after reading these.
["Complete Works of Sanmao" ] ["Lessons From History" by Nan Huaijin] I came to the U.S. in 1995, so which books did I read here first?
Books banned in China, of course.
"The Good Earth" is about Chinese peasant life.
That's just not convenient for propaganda. Got it.
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a topic for a different day.
But the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany: "You shall honor your father and mother."
"Honor," I said. "That's so different, and better, than obey."
So it becomes my tool to climb out of this Confucian guilt trap and to restart my relationship with my parents.
Encountering a new culture also started my habit of comparative reading.
It offers many insights.
For example, I found this map out of place at first because this is what Chinese students grew up with.
It had never occurred to me, China doesn't have to be at the center of the world.
A map actually carries somebody's view.
Comparative reading actually is nothing new.
It's a standard practice in the academic world.
There are even research fields such as comparative religion and comparative literature.
Compare and contrast gives scholars a more complete understanding of a topic.
So I thought, well, if comparative reading works for research, why not do it in daily life too?
So I started reading books in pairs.
So they can be about people -- ["Benjamin Franklin" by Walter Isaacson]["John Adams" by David McCullough] -- who are involved in the same event, or friends with shared experiences.
["Personal History" by Katharine Graham]["The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life," by Alice Schroeder] I also compare the same stories in different genres -- [Holy Bible: King James Version]["Lamb" by Chrisopher Moore] -- or similar stories from different cultures, as Joseph Campbell did in his wonderful book.["The Power of Myth" by Joseph Campbell] For example, both the Christ and the Buddha went through three temptations.
For the Christ, the temptations are economic, political and spiritual.
For the Buddha, they are all psychological: lust, fear and social duty -- interesting.
So if you know a foreign language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
["The Way of Chuang Tzu" Thomas Merton]["Tao: The Watercourse Way" Alan Watts] Instead of lost in translation, I found there is much to gain.
For example, it's through translation that I realized "happiness" in Chinese literally means "fast joy." Huh!
"Bride" in Chinese literally means "new mother." Uh-oh.
Books have given me a magic portal to connect with people of the past and the present.
I know I shall never feel lonely or powerless again.
Having a dream shattered really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered.
I have come to believe that coming true is not the only purpose of a dream.
Its most important purpose is to get us in touch with where dreams come from, where passion comes from, where happiness comes from.
Even a shattered dream can do that for you.
So because of books, I'm here today, happy, living again with a purpose and a clarity, most of the time.
So may books be always with you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I grew up in a very small country town in Victoria.
I had a very normal, low-key kind of upbringing.
I went to school, I hung out with my friends, I fought with my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15, a member of my local community approached my parents and wanted to nominate me for a community achievement award.
And my parents said, "Hm, that's really nice, but there's kind of one glaring problem with that.
She hasn't actually achieved anything." And they were right, you know.
I went to school, I got good marks, I had a very low-key after school job in my mum's hairdressing salon, and I spent a lot of time watching "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Dawson's Creek."
Yeah, I know. What a contradiction.
But they were right, you know.
Years later, I was on my second teaching round in a Melbourne high school, and I was about 20 minutes into a year 11 legal studies class when this boy put up his hand and said, "Hey miss, when are you going to start doing your speech?"
And I said, "What speech?"
You know, I'd been talking them about defamation law for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, like, your motivational speaking.
You know, when people in wheelchairs come to school, they usually say, like, inspirational stuff?"
"It's usually in the big hall."
And that's when it dawned on me: This kid had only ever experienced disabled people as objects of inspiration.
We are not, to this kid -- and it's not his fault, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For lots of us, disabled people are not our teachers or our doctors or our manicurists.
We're not real people. We are there to inspire.
And in fact, I am sitting on this stage looking like I do in this wheelchair, and you are probably kind of expecting me to inspire you. Right? Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid I'm going to disappoint you dramatically.
I am not here to inspire you.
I am here to tell you that we have been lied to about disability.
It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't make you exceptional.
And in the past few years, we've been able to propagate this lie even further via social media.
You may have seen images like this one: "The only disability in life is a bad attitude."
Or this one: "Your excuse is invalid." Indeed.
Or this one: "Before you quit, try!"
These are just a couple of examples, but there are a lot of these images out there.
You know, you might have seen the one, the little girl with no hands drawing a picture with a pencil held in her mouth.
You might have seen a child running on carbon fiber prosthetic legs.
And these images, there are lots of them out there, they are what we call inspiration porn.
And I use the term porn deliberately, because they objectify one group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we're objectifying disabled people for the benefit of nondisabled people.
The purpose of these images is to inspire you, to motivate you, so that we can look at them and think, "Well, however bad my life is, it could be worse.
I could be that person."
But what if you are that person?
I've lost count of the number of times that I've been approached by strangers wanting to tell me that they think I'm brave or inspirational, and this was long before my work had any kind of public profile.
They were just kind of congratulating me for managing to get up in the morning and remember my own name. And it is objectifying.
These images, those images objectify disabled people for the benefit of nondisabled people.
They are there so that you can look at them and think that things aren't so bad for you, to put your worries into perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually somewhat difficult.
We do overcome some things.
But the things that we're overcoming are not the things that you think they are.
They are not things to do with our bodies.
I use the term "disabled people" quite deliberately, because I subscribe to what's called the social model of disability, which tells us that we are more disabled by the society that we live in than by our bodies and our diagnoses.
So I have lived in this body a long time.
I'm quite fond of it.
It does the things that I need it to do, and I've learned to use it to the best of its capacity just as you have, and that's the thing about those kids in those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the ordinary.
They are just using their bodies to the best of their capacity.
So is it really fair to objectify them in the way that we do, to share those images?
People, when they say, "You're an inspiration," they mean it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, it's because we've been sold this lie that disability makes you exceptional.
You know, I'm up here bagging out inspiration, and you're thinking, "Jeez, Stella, aren't you inspired sometimes by some things?"
And the thing is, I am.
I learn from other disabled people all the time.
I'm learning not that I am luckier than them, though.
I am learning that it's a genius idea to use a pair of barbecue tongs to pick up things that you dropped. I'm learning that nifty trick where you can charge your mobile phone battery from your chair battery.
Genius.
We are learning from each others' strength and endurance, not against our bodies and our diagnoses, but against a world that exceptionalizes and objectifies us.
I really think that this lie that we've been sold about disability is the greatest injustice.
It makes life hard for us.
And that quote, "The only disability in life is a bad attitude," the reason that that's bullshit is because it's just not true, because of the social model of disability.
No amount of smiling at a flight of stairs has ever made it turn into a ramp.
It's just not going to happen.
I really want to live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live in a world where a 15-year-old girl sitting in her bedroom watching "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" isn't referred to as achieving anything because she's doing it sitting down.
I want to live in a world where we don't have such low expectations of disabled people that we are congratulated for getting out of bed and remembering our own names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value genuine achievement for disabled people, and I want to live in a world where a kid in year 11 in a Melbourne high school is not one bit surprised that his new teacher is a wheelchair user.
Disability doesn't make you exceptional, but questioning what you think you know about it does.
Thank you.
On November 5th, 1990, a man named El-Sayyid Nosair walked into a hotel in Manhattan and assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane, the leader of the Jewish Defense League.
Nosair was initially found not guilty of the murder, but while serving time on lesser charges, he and other men began planning attacks on a dozen New York City landmarks, including tunnels, synagogues and the United Nations headquarters.
Thankfully, those plans were foiled by an FBI informant.
Sadly, the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center was not.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1983 to him, an Egyptian engineer, and a loving American mother and grade school teacher, who together tried their best to create a happy childhood for me.
It wasn't until I was seven years old that our family dynamic started to change.
My father exposed me to a side of Islam that few people, including the majority of Muslims, get to see.
However, in every religion, in every population, you'll find a small percentage of people who hold so fervently to their beliefs that they feel they must use any means necessary to make others live as they do.
We arrived at Calverton Shooting Range, which unbeknownst to our group was being watched by the FBI.
That day, the last bullet I shot hit the small orange light that sat on top of the target and to everyone's surprise, especially mine, the entire target burst into flames.
They all seemed to get a really big laugh out of that comment, but it wasn't until a few years later that I fully understood what they thought was so funny.
They thought they saw in me the same destruction my father was capable of.
Those men would eventually be convicted of placing a van filled with 1,500 pounds of explosives into the sub-level parking lot of the World Trade Center's North Tower, causing an explosion that killed six people and injured over 1,000 others.
These were the men I looked up to.
These were the men I called ammu, which means uncle.
By the time I turned 19, I had already moved 20 times in my life, and that instability during my childhood didn't really provide an opportunity to make many friends.
Each time I would begin to feel comfortable around someone, it was time to pack up and move to the next town.
Being the perpetual new face in class, I was frequently the target of bullies.
So for the most part, I spent my time at home reading books and watching TV or playing video games.
For those reasons, my social skills were lacking, to say the least, and growing up in a bigoted household, I wasn't prepared for the real world.
I'd been raised to judge people based on arbitrary measurements, like a person's race or religion.
So what opened my eyes?
One of my first experiences that challenged this way of thinking was during the 2000 presidential elections.
Through a college prep program, I was able to take part in the National Youth Convention in Philadelphia.
My particular group's focus was on youth violence, and having been the victim of bullying for most of my life, this was a subject in which I felt particularly passionate.
The members of our group came from many different walks of life.
One day toward the end of the convention, I found out that one of the kids I had befriended was Jewish.
Now, it had taken several days for this detail to come to light, and I realized that there was no natural animosity between the two of us.
There, I was exposed to people from all sorts of faiths and cultures, and that experience proved to be fundamental to the development of my character.
Because of that feeling, I was able to contrast the stereotypes I'd been taught as a child with real life experience and interaction.
I don't know what it's like to be gay, but I'm well acquainted with being judged for something that's beyond my control.
Then there was "The Daily Show."
Inspiration can often come from an unexpected place, and the fact that a Jewish comedian had done more to positively influence my worldview than my own extremist father is not lost on me.
One day, I had a conversation with my mother about how my worldview was starting to change, and she said something to me that I will hold dear to my heart for as long as I live.
She looked at me with the weary eyes of someone who had experienced enough dogmatism to last a lifetime, and said, "I'm tired of hating people."
In that instant, I realized how much negative energy it takes to hold that hatred inside of you.
Zak Ebrahim is not my real name.
I changed it when my family decided to end our connection with my father and start a new life.
So why would I out myself and potentially put myself in danger?
Well, that's simple.
Instead, I choose to use my experience to fight back against terrorism, against the bigotry.
I do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones, for the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has forced upon their lives.
For the victims of terrorism, I will speak out against these senseless acts and condemn my father's actions.
And with that simple fact, I stand here as proof that violence isn't inherent in one's religion or race, and the son does not have to follow the ways of his father.
I am not my father.
Hello, TEDWomen, what's up.
Not good enough.
Hello, TEDWomen, what is up?
My name is Maysoon Zayid, and I am not drunk, but the doctor who delivered me was.
He cut my mom six different times in six different directions, suffocating poor little me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, which means I shake all the time.
Look.
It's exhausting. I'm like Shakira, Shakira meets Muhammad Ali.
C.P. is not genetic.
It's not a birth defect. You can't catch it.
No one put a curse on my mother's uterus, and I didn't get it because my parents are first cousins, which they are.
It only happens from accidents, like what happened to me on my birth day.
Now, I must warn you, I'm not inspirational, and I don't want anyone in this room to feel bad for me, because at some point in your life, you have dreamt of being disabled.
Come on a journey with me.
It's Christmas Eve, you're at the mall, you're driving around in circles looking for parking, and what do you see?
Sixteen empty handicapped spaces.
And you're like, "God, can't I just be a little disabled?"
Also, I gotta tell you, I got 99 problems, and palsy is just one.
If there was an Oppression Olympics, I would win the gold medal.
I'm Palestinian, Muslim, I'm female, I'm disabled, and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better about yourself, maybe you should.
Cliffside Park, New Jersey is my hometown.
I have always loved the fact that my hood and my affliction share the same initials.
I also love the fact that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York City, I could.
A lot of people with C.P. don't walk, but my parents didn't believe in "can't."
My father's mantra was, "You can do it, yes you can can."
So, if my three older sisters were mopping, I was mopping.
If my three older sisters went to public school, my parents would sue the school system and guarantee that I went too, and if we didn't all get A's, we all got my mother's slipper.
My father taught me how to walk when I was five years old by placing my heels on his feet and just walking.
Another tactic that he used is he would dangle a dollar bill in front of me and have me chase it.
My inner stripper was very strong, and by -- Yeah. No, by the first day of kindergarten, I was walking like a champ who had been punched one too many times.
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my town, and they were all my family.
Now there are 20 Arabs in town, and they are still all my family.
I don't think anyone even noticed we weren't Italian.
This was before 9/11 and before politicians thought it was appropriate to use "I hate Moslems" as a campaign slogan.
The people that I grew up with had no problem with my faith.
They did, however, seem very concerned that I would starve to death during Ramadan.
I would explain to them that I have enough fat to live off of for three whole months, so fasting from sunrise to sunset is a piece of cake.
I have tap-danced on Broadway.
Yeah, on Broadway. It's crazy.
My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to dancing school.
I learned how to dance in heels, which means I can walk in heels.
And I'm from Jersey, and we are really concerned with being chic, so if my friends wore heels, so did I.
And when my friends went and spent their summer vacations on the Jersey Shore, I did not.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we didn't go back to Palestine every single summer, we'd grow up to be Madonna.
Summer vacations often consisted of my father trying to heal me, so I drank deer's milk, I had hot cups on my back, I was dunked in the Dead Sea, and I remember the water burning my eyes and thinking, "It's working! It's working!"
But one miracle cure we did find was yoga.
I have to tell you, it's very boring, but before I did yoga, I was a stand-up comedian who can't stand up.
And now I can stand on my head.
My parents reinforced this notion that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be on the daytime soap opera "General Hospital."
I went to college during affirmative action and got a sweet scholarship to ASU, Arizona State University, because I fit every single quota.
I was like the pet lemur of the theater department.
Everybody loved me.
I did all the less-than-intelligent kids' homework, I got A's in all of my classes, A's in all of their classes.
Every time I did a scene from "The Glass Menagerie," my professors would weep.
But I never got cast.
Finally, my senior year, ASU decided to do a show called "They Dance Real Slow in Jackson."
It's a play about a girl with C.P.
I was a girl with C.P.
So I start shouting from the rooftops, "I'm finally going to get a part!
I have cerebral palsy!
Free at last! Free at last!
Thank God almighty, I'm free at last!"
I didn't get the part.
Sherry Brown got the part.
I went racing to the head of the theater department crying hysterically, like someone shot my cat, to ask her why, and she said it was because they didn't think I could do the stunts.
I said, "Excuse me, if I can't do the stunts, neither can the character."
This was a part that I was literally born to play and they gave it, they gave it to a non-palsy actress.
College was imitating life.
Hollywood has a sordid history of casting able-bodied actors to play disabled onscreen.
Upon graduating, I moved back home, and my first acting gig was as an extra on a daytime soap opera.
My dream was coming true.
And I knew that I would be promoted from "diner diner" to "wacky best friend" in no time.
But instead, I remained a glorified piece of furniture that you could only recognize from the back of my head, and it became clear to me that casting directors didn't hire fluffy, ethnic, disabled actors.
They only hired perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching Whoopi Goldberg, Roseanne Barr, Ellen, and all of these women had one thing in common: they were comedians.
So I became a comic.
My first gig was driving famous comics from New York City to shows in New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first comic I ever drove when he realized that he was speeding down the New Jersey Turnpike with a chick with C.P. driving him.
I've performed in clubs all over America, and I've also performed in Arabic in the Middle East, uncensored and uncovered.
Some people say I'm the first stand-up comic in the Arab world.
I never like to claim first, but I do know that they never heard that nasty little rumor that women aren't funny, and they find us hysterical.
In 2003, my brother from another mother and father Dean Obeidallah and I started the New York Arab-American Comedy Festival, now in its 10th year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of Arab-Americans in media, while also reminding casting directors that South Asian and Arab are not synonymous.
Mainstreaming Arabs was much, much easier than conquering the challenge against the stigma against disability.
My big break came in 2010.
I was invited to be a guest on the cable news show "Countdown With Keith Olbermann."
I walked in looking like I was going to the prom, and they shuffle me into a studio and seat me on a spinning, rolling chair.
So I looked at the stage manager and I'm like, "Excuse me, can I have another chair?"
And she looked at me and she went, "Five, four, three, two ..."
And we were live, right?
So I had to grip onto the anchor's desk so that I wouldn't roll off the screen during the segment, and when the interview was over, I was livid.
I had finally gotten my chance and I blew it, and I knew I would never get invited back.
But not only did Mr. Olbermann invite me back, he made me a full-time contributor, and he taped down my chair.
One fun fact I learned while on the air with Keith Olbermann was that humans on the Internet are scumbags.
People say children are cruel, but I was never made fun of as a child or an adult.
Suddenly, my disability on the world wide web is fair game.
I would look at clips online and see comments like, "Yo, why's she tweakin?"
"Yo, is she retarded?"
And my favorite, "Poor Gumby-mouth terrorist.
What does she suffer from?
We should really pray for her."
One commenter even suggested that I add my disability to my credits: screenwriter, comedian, palsy.
Disability is as visual as race.
If a wheelchair user can't play Beyoncé, then Beyoncé can't play a wheelchair user.
The disabled are the largest — Yeah, clap for that, man. C'mon.
People with disabilities are the largest minority in the world, and we are the most underrepresented in entertainment.
The doctors said that I wouldn't walk, but I am here in front of you.
However, if I grew up with social media, I don't think I would be.
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life.
Perhaps if there were more positive images, it would foster less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe it still takes a village to teach our children well.
My crooked journey has taken me to some very spectacular places.
I got to walk the red carpet flanked by soap diva Susan Lucci and the iconic Lorraine Arbus.
I got to act in a movie with Adam Sandler and work with my idol, the amazing Dave Matthews.
I toured the world as a headliner on Arabs Gone Wild.
I was a delegate representing the great state of New Jersey at the 2008 DNC.
And I founded Maysoon's Kids, a charity that hopes to give Palestinian refugee children a sliver of the chance my parents gave me.
But the one moment that stands out the most was when I got -- before this moment -- — but the one moment that stands out the most was when I got to perform for the man who floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee, has Parkinson's and shakes just like me, Muhammad Ali.
It was the only time that my father ever saw me perform live, and I dedicate this talk to his memory.
My name is Maysoon Zayid, and if I can can, you can can.
You know, my favorite part of being a dad is the movies I get to watch.
I love sharing my favorite movies with my kids, and when my daughter was four, we got to watch "The Wizard of Oz" together.
It totally dominated her imagination for months.
Her favorite character was Glinda, of course.
It gave her a great excuse to wear a sparkly dress and carry a wand.
But you watch that movie enough times, and you start to realize how unusual it is.
Now we live today, and are raising our children, in a kind of children's-fantasy-spectacular-industrial complex.
But "The Wizard of Oz" stood alone.
It did not start that trend.
Forty years later was when the trend really caught on, with, interestingly, another movie that featured a metal guy and a furry guy rescuing a girl by dressing up as the enemy's guards.
Do you know what I'm talking about?
Yeah.
Now, there's a big difference between these two movies, a couple of really big differences between "The Wizard of Oz" and all the movies we watch today.
One is there's very little violence in "The Wizard of Oz."
The monkeys are rather aggressive, as are the apple trees.
But I think if "The Wizard of Oz" were made today, the wizard would say, "Dorothy, you are the savior of Oz that the prophecy foretold.
Use your magic slippers to defeat the computer-generated armies of the Wicked Witch."
But that's not how it happens.
Another thing that's really unique about "The Wizard of Oz" to me is that all of the most heroic and wise and even villainous characters are female.
Now I started to notice this when I actually showed "Star Wars" to my daughter, which was years later, and the situation was different.
At that point I also had a son.
He was only three at the time.
He was not invited to the screening. He was too young for that.
But he was the second child, and the level of supervision had plummeted.
So he wandered in, and it imprinted on him like a mommy duck does to its duckling, and I don't think he understands what's going on, but he is sure soaking in it.
And I wonder what he's soaking in.
Is he picking up on the themes of courage and perseverance and loyalty?
Is he picking up on the fact that Luke joins an army to overthrow the government?
Is he picking up on the fact that there are only boys in the universe except for Aunt Beru, and of course this princess, who's really cool, but who kind of waits around through most of the movie so that she can award the hero with a medal and a wink to thank him for saving the universe, which he does by the magic that he was born with?
Compare this to 1939 with "The Wizard of Oz."
How does Dorothy win her movie?
By making friends with everybody and being a leader.
That's kind of the world I'd rather raise my kids in -- Oz, right? -- and not the world of dudes fighting, which is where we kind of have to be.
Why is there so much Force -- capital F, Force -- in the movies we have for our kids, and so little yellow brick road?
There is a lot of great writing about the impact that the boy-violent movie has on girls, and you should do that reading. It's very good.
I haven't read as much on how boys are picking up on this vibe.
I know from my own experience that Princess Leia did not provide the adequate context that I could have used in navigating the adult world that is co-ed.
I think there was a first-kiss moment when I really expected the credits to start rolling because that's the end of the movie, right?
I finished my quest, I got the girl.
Why are you still standing there?
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
The movies are very, very focused on defeating the villain and getting your reward, and there's not a lot of room for other relationships and other journeys.
It's almost as though if you're a boy, you are a dopey animal, and if you are a girl, you should bring your warrior costume.
There are plenty of exceptions, and I will defend the Disney princesses in front of any you.
But they do send a message to boys, that they are not, the boys are not really the target audience.
They are doing a phenomenal job of teaching girls how to defend against the patriarchy, but they are not necessarily showing boys how they're supposed to defend against the patriarchy.
There's no models for them.
And we also have some terrific women who are writing new stories for our kids, and as three-dimensional and delightful as Hermione and Katniss are, these are still war movies.
And, of course, the most successful studio of all time continues to crank out classic after classic, every single one of them about the journey of a boy, or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who are raising a little girl.
Until, as many of you are thinking, this year, when they finally came out with "Brave."
I recommend it to all of you. It's on demand now.
Do you remember what the critics said when "Brave" came out?
"Aw, I can't believe Pixar made a princess movie."
It's very good. Don't let that stop you.
Now, almost none of these movies pass the Bechdel Test.
I don't know if you've heard of this.
It has not yet caught on and caught fire, but maybe today we will start a movement.
Alison Bechdel is a comic book artist, and back in the mid-'80s, she recorded this conversation she'd had with a friend about assessing the movies that they saw.
And it's very simple. There's just three questions you should ask: Is there more than one character in the movie that is female who has lines?
So try to meet that bar.
And do these women talk to each other at any point in the movie?
And is their conversation about something other than the guy that they both like?
Right? Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk to each other about stuff.
It does happen. I've seen it, and yet I very rarely see it in the movies that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very high-quality movie, "Argo."
Right? Oscar buzz, doing great at the box office, a consensus idea of what a quality Hollywood film is.
It pretty much flunks the Bechdel test.
And I don't think it should, because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, but a lot of the movie takes place in this embassy where men and women are hiding out during the hostage crisis.
We've got quite a few scenes of the men having deep, angst-ridden conversations in this hideout, and the great moment for one of the actresses is to peek through the door and say, "Are you coming to bed, honey?"
That's Hollywood for you.
So let's look at the numbers.
2011, of the 100 most popular movies, how many of them do you think actually have female protagonists?
Eleven. It's not bad.
It's not as many percent as the number of women we've just elected to Congress, so that's good.
But there is a number that is greater than this that's going to bring this room down.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
Here's what it said.
One out of five women in America say that they have been sexually assaulted some time in their life.
Now, I don't think that's the fault of popular entertainment.
I don't think kids' movies have anything to do with that.
I don't even think that music videos or pornography are really directly related to that, but something is going wrong, and when I hear that statistic, one of the things I think of is that's a lot of sexual assailants.
Who are these guys? What are they learning?
What are they failing to learn?
Are they absorbing the story that a male hero's job is to defeat the villain with violence and then collect the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and doesn't speak?
Are we soaking up that story?
You know, as a parent with the privilege of raising a daughter like all of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this statistic very alarming and we want to prepare them.
We have tools at our disposal like "girl power," and we hope that that will help, but I gotta wonder, is girl power going to protect them if, at the same time, actively or passively, we are training our sons to maintain their boy power?
I mean, I think the Netflix queue is one way that we can do something very important, and I'm talking mainly to the dads here.
I think we have got to show our sons a new definition of manhood.
The definition of manhood is already turning upside down.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the roles of caregiver and wage earner.
They're throwing it up in the air.
So our sons are going to have to find some way of adapting to this, some new relationship with each other, and I think we really have to show them, and model for them, how a real man is someone who trusts his sisters and respects them, and wants to be on their team, and stands up against the real bad guys, who are the men who want to abuse the women.
And I think our job in the Netflix queue is to look out for those movies that pass the Bechdel Test, if we can find them, and to seek out the heroines who are there, who show real courage, who bring people together, and to nudge our sons to identify with those heroines and to say, "I want to be on their team," because they're going to be on their team.
When I asked my daughter who her favorite character was in "Star Wars," do you know what she said?
Obi-Wan.
Obi-Wan Kenobi and Glinda.
What do these two have in common?
Maybe it's not just the sparkly dress.
I think these people are experts.
I think these are the two people in the movie who know more than anybody else, and they love sharing their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential.
Now, they are leaders.
I like that kind of quest for my daughter, and I like that kind of quest for my son.
I want more quests like that.
I want fewer quests where my son is told, "Go out and fight it alone," and more quests where he sees that it's his job to join a team, maybe a team led by women, to help other people become better and be better people, like the Wizard of Oz.
Thank you.
Throughout the history of computers we've been striving to shorten the gap between us and digital information, the gap between our physical world and the world in the screen where our imagination can go wild.
And this gap has become shorter, shorter, and even shorter, and now this gap is shortened down to less than a millimeter, the thickness of a touch-screen glass, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I wondered, what if there could be no boundary at all?
I started to imagine what this would look like.
First, I created this tool which penetrates into the digital space, so when you press it hard on the screen, it transfers its physical body into pixels.
Designers can materialize their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice on virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool, this boundary has been broken.
But our two hands still remain outside the screen.
How can you reach inside and interact with the digital information using the full dexterity of our hands?
At Microsoft Applied Sciences, along with my mentor Cati Boulanger, I redesigned the computer and turned a little space above the keyboard into a digital workspace.
By combining a transparent display and depth cameras for sensing your fingers and face, now you can lift up your hands from the keyboard and reach inside this 3D space and grab pixels with your bare hands.
Because windows and files have a position in the real space, selecting them is as easy as grabbing a book off your shelf.
Then you can flip through this book while highlighting the lines, words on the virtual touch pad below each floating window.
Architects can stretch or rotate the models with their two hands directly.
So in these examples, we are reaching into the digital world.
But how about reversing its role and having the digital information reach us instead?
I'm sure many of us have had the experience of buying and returning items online.
But now you don't have to worry about it.
What I got here is an online augmented fitting room.
This is a view that you get from head-mounted or see-through display when the system understands the geometry of your body.
Taking this idea further, I started to think, instead of just seeing these pixels in our space, how can we make it physical so that we can touch and feel it?
What would such a future look like?
At MIT Media Lab, along with my advisor Hiroshi Ishii and my collaborator Rehmi Post, we created this one physical pixel.
Well, in this case, this spherical magnet acts like a 3D pixel in our space, which means that both computers and people can move this object to anywhere within this little 3D space.
What we did was essentially canceling gravity and controlling the movement by combining magnetic levitation and mechanical actuation and sensing technologies.
And by digitally programming the object, we are liberating the object from constraints of time and space, which means that now, human motions can be recorded and played back and left permanently in the physical world.
So choreography can be taught physically over distance and Michael Jordan's famous shooting can be replicated over and over as a physical reality.
Students can use this as a tool to learn about the complex concepts such as planetary motion, physics, and unlike computer screens or textbooks, this is a real, tangible experience that you can touch and feel, and it's very powerful.
And what's more exciting than just turning what's currently in the computer physical is to start imagining how programming the world will alter even our daily physical activities.
As you can see, the digital information will not just show us something but it will start directly acting upon us as a part of our physical surroundings without disconnecting ourselves from our world.
Today, we started by talking about the boundary, but if we remove this boundary, the only boundary left is our imagination.
Thank you.
Right now you have a movie playing inside your head.
It's an amazing multi-track movie.
It has 3D vision and surround sound for what you're seeing and hearing right now, but that's just the start of it.
Your movie has smell and taste and touch.
It has a sense of your body, pain, hunger, orgasms.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like scenes from your childhood playing before you.
And it has this constant voiceover narrative in your stream of conscious thinking.
At the heart of this movie is you experiencing all this directly.
This movie is your stream of consciousness, the subject of experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental facts of human existence.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have our own inner movie, you and you and you.
There's nothing we know about more directly.
At least, I know about my consciousness directly.
I can't be certain that you guys are conscious.
Consciousness also is what makes life worth living.
If we weren't conscious, nothing in our lives would have meaning or value.
But at the same time, it's the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why aren't we just robots who process all this input, produce all that output, without experiencing the inner movie at all?
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I'm going to suggest that to integrate consciousness into science, some radical ideas may be needed.
Some people say a science of consciousness is impossible.
Science, by its nature, is objective.
Consciousness, by its nature, is subjective.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
For much of the 20th century, that view held sway.
Psychologists studied behavior objectively, neuroscientists studied the brain objectively, and nobody even mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED got started, there was very little scientific work on consciousness.
Now, about 20 years ago, all that began to change.
Neuroscientists like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger Penrose said now is the time for science to attack consciousness.
And since then, there's been a real explosion, a flowering of scientific work on consciousness.
And this work has been wonderful. It's been great.
But it also has some fundamental limitations so far.
We saw some of this kind of work from Nancy Kanwisher and the wonderful work she presented just a few minutes ago.
Now we understand much better, for example, the kinds of brain areas that go along with the conscious experience of seeing faces or of feeling pain or of feeling happy.
But this is still a science of correlations.
It's not a science of explanations.
We know that these brain areas go along with certain kinds of conscious experience, but we don't know why they do.
I like to put this by saying that this kind of work from neuroscience is answering some of the questions we want answered about consciousness, the questions about what certain brain areas do and what they correlate with.
But in a certain sense, those are the easy problems.
No knock on the neuroscientists.
There are no truly easy problems with consciousness.
But it doesn't address the real mystery at the core of this subject: why is it that all that physical processing in a brain should be accompanied by consciousness at all?
Why is there this inner subjective movie?
Right now, we don't really have a bead on that.
And you might say, let's just give neuroscience a few years.
It'll turn out to be another emergent phenomenon like traffic jams, like hurricanes, like life, and we'll figure it out.
The classical cases of emergence are all cases of emergent behavior, how a traffic jam behaves, how a hurricane functions, how a living organism reproduces and adapts and metabolizes, all questions about objective functioning.
You could apply that to the human brain in explaining some of the behaviors and the functions of the human brain as emergent phenomena: how we walk, how we talk, how we play chess, all these questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, questions about behavior are among the easy problems.
When it comes to the hard problem, that's the question of why is it that all this behavior is accompanied by subjective experience?
And here, the standard paradigm of emergence, even the standard paradigms of neuroscience, don't really, so far, have that much to say.
Now, I'm a scientific materialist at heart.
I want a scientific theory of consciousness that works, and for a long time, I banged my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in purely physical terms that would work.
But I eventually came to the conclusion that that just didn't work for systematic reasons.
So I think we're at a kind of impasse here.
We've got this wonderful, great chain of explanation, we're used to it, where physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains parts of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this picture.
On the one hand, it's a datum that we're conscious.
On the other hand, we don't know how to accommodate it into our scientific view of the world.
So I think consciousness right now is a kind of anomaly, one that we need to integrate into our view of the world, but we don't yet see how.
Faced with an anomaly like this, radical ideas may be needed, and I think that we may need one or two ideas that initially seem crazy before we can come to grips with consciousness scientifically.
Now, there are a few candidates for what those crazy ideas might be.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no hard problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of the inner subjective movie involves a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, all we've got to do is explain the objective functions, the behaviors of the brain, and then we've explained everything that needs to be explained.
Well I say, more power to him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if you want to have a purely reductionist brain-based theory of consciousness.
At the same time, for me and for many other people, that view is a bit too close to simply denying the datum of consciousness to be satisfactory.
So I go in a different direction.
In the time remaining, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think may have some promise.
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental.
Physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as fundamental building blocks: space and time and mass.
They postulate fundamental laws governing them, like the laws of gravity or of quantum mechanics.
These fundamental properties and laws aren't explained in terms of anything more basic.
Rather, they're taken as primitive, and you build up the world from there.
Now sometimes, the list of fundamentals expands.
In the 19th century, Maxwell figured out that you can't explain electromagnetic phenomena in terms of the existing fundamentals — space, time, mass, Newton's laws — so he postulated fundamental laws of electromagnetism and postulated electric charge as a fundamental element that those laws govern.
I think that's the situation we're in with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of the existing fundamentals — space, time, mass, charge — then as a matter of logic, you need to expand the list.
The natural thing to do is to postulate consciousness itself as something fundamental, a fundamental building block of nature.
This doesn't mean you suddenly can't do science with it.
This opens up the way for you to do science with it.
What we then need is to study the fundamental laws governing consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness to other fundamentals: space, time, mass, physical processes.
Physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws so simple that we could write them on the front of a t-shirt.
Well I think something like that is the situation we're in with consciousness.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple we could write them on the front of a t-shirt.
We don't know what those laws are yet, but that's what we're after.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness might be universal.
Every system might have some degree of consciousness.
This view is sometimes called panpsychism: pan for all, psych for mind, every system is conscious, not just humans, dogs, mice, flies, but even Rob Knight's microbes, elementary particles.
Even a photon has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are intelligent or thinking.
It's not that a photon is wracked with angst because it's thinking, "Aww, I'm always buzzing around near the speed of light.
I never get to slow down and smell the roses."
No, not like that.
But the thought is maybe photons might have some element of raw, subjective feeling, some primitive precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a bit kooky to you.
I mean, why would anyone think such a crazy thing?
Some motivation comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is fundamental.
If it's fundamental, like space and time and mass, it's natural to suppose that it might be universal too, the way they are.
It's also worth noting that although the idea seems counterintuitive to us, it's much less counterintuitive to people from different cultures, where the human mind is seen as much more continuous with nature.
A deeper motivation comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful way to find fundamental laws connecting consciousness to physical processing is to link consciousness to information.
Wherever there's information processing, there's consciousness.
Complex information processing, like in a human, complex consciousness.
Simple information processing, simple consciousness.
A really exciting thing is in recent years a neuroscientist, Giulio Tononi, has taken this kind of theory and developed it rigorously with a mathematical theory.
He has a mathematical measure of information integration which he calls phi, measuring the amount of information integrated in a system.
And he supposes that phi goes along with consciousness.
So in a human brain, incredibly large amount of information integration, high degree of phi, a whole lot of consciousness.
In a mouse, medium degree of information integration, still pretty significant, pretty serious amount of consciousness.
But as you go down to worms, microbes, particles, the amount of phi falls off.
The amount of information integration falls off, but it's still non-zero.
On Tononi's theory, there's still going to be a non-zero degree of consciousness.
In effect, he's proposing a fundamental law of consciousness: high phi, high consciousness.
Now, I don't know if this theory is right, but it's actually perhaps the leading theory right now in the science of consciousness, and it's been used to integrate a whole range of scientific data, and it does have a nice property that it is in fact simple enough you can write it on the front of a t-shirt.
Another final motivation is that panpsychism might help us to integrate consciousness into the physical world.
Physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a bunch of equations, but it doesn't tell us about the reality that underlies it.
As Stephen Hawking puts it, what puts the fire into the equations?
Well, on the panpsychist view, you can leave the equations of physics as they are, but you can take them to be describing the flux of consciousness.
That's what physics really is ultimately doing, describing the flux of consciousness.
On this view, it's consciousness that puts the fire into the equations.
On that view, consciousness doesn't dangle outside the physical world as some kind of extra.
It's there right at its heart.
This view, I think, the panpsychist view, has the potential to transfigure our relationship to nature, and it may have some pretty serious social and ethical consequences.
Some of these may be counterintuitive.
I used to think I shouldn't eat anything which is conscious, so therefore I should be vegetarian.
Now, if you're a panpsychist and you take that view, you're going to go very hungry.
So I think when you think about it, this tends to transfigure your views, whereas what matters for ethical purposes and moral considerations, not so much the fact of consciousness, but the degree and the complexity of consciousness.
It's also natural to ask about consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificially intelligent system in the movie "Her," Samantha?
Is she conscious?
Well, if you take the informational, panpsychist view, she certainly has complicated information processing and integration, so the answer is very likely yes, she is conscious.
If that's right, it raises pretty serious ethical issues about both the ethics of developing intelligent computer systems and the ethics of turning them off.
Finally, you might ask about the consciousness of whole groups, the planet.
Does Canada have its own consciousness?
Or at a more local level, does an integrated group like the audience at a TED conference, are we right now having a collective TED consciousness, an inner movie for this collective TED group which is distinct from the inner movies of each of our parts?
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think it's at least one worth taking seriously.
Okay, so this panpsychist vision, it is a radical one, and I don't know that it's correct.
I'm actually more confident about the first crazy idea, that consciousness is fundamental, than about the second one, that it's universal.
I mean, the view raises any number of questions, has any number of challenges, like how do those little bits of consciousness add up to the kind of complex consciousness we know and love.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going to be well on our way to a serious theory of consciousness.
If not, well, this is the hardest problem perhaps in science and philosophy.
We can't expect to solve it overnight.
But I do think we're going to figure it out eventually.
Understanding consciousness is a real key, I think, both to understanding the universe and to understanding ourselves.
It may just take the right crazy idea.
Thank you.
