There are those today that dispute that, and lots of debates about how the mind works, but for me it's simple: Mental images, for most of us, are central in inventive and creative thinking.
So after several years, I tuned myself up and I have lots of great, really vivid mental images with a lot of sophistication and the analytical backbone behind them.
And so now I'm working on, how can I get these mental images in my mind out to my computer screen faster?
Can you imagine, if you will, a movie director being able to use her imagination alone to direct the world in front of her?
Translate English to German:
Or a musician to get the music out of his head?
