Obviously, it would be great. Let's talk about it over dinner tonight. A friendly dinner. We'll talk it over.
That's a costume I could wear. It'd be a change from feathers. They always cover me in them! This is too long.
I wasn't armed with a knife, your Honor. I had it on me when I left my dressing room.
Nothing? You return from Europe with a masterpiece worth $100,000, and instead of displaying it yourself, you let me unveil it at my party for Captain Spaulding. You call that nothing? - Mrs. Rittenhouse, I...
My friends, I'm highly gratified of this display of effusion. Hooray for Captain Spaulding...
Where did she get that?
Where did she get that? Is it very valuable?
That's the famous Beaugard, eh? Great picture, isn't it?
Suppose when she unveils it, it's not the Beaugard at all.
You lose it? You gotta find it.
This is perhaps his masterpiece.
Good heavens. It's gone. - Gone?
You mean the piksh? - Yes.
Let me see that a minute. It's signed "Beaugard". There's the criminal. No. Beaugard is dead. Dead?
Where's the egg? It could be spinach. Look at all the sand.
This painting wasn't stolen. It has disappeared. Yes, disappeared. And you know what make it disappear? Moths!
First time it's ever been tried.
Is that how it seems to you? How else can I take it? It's nothing to me how you take it.
Is that how it seems to you? How else can I take it? It's nothing to me how you take it. But it matters a heap to me, ma'am, how you understand. Perhaps not.
He knows my tongue is straight. Well, what do you mean?
Shank me off a snack! Get out of there. Fine piece of beef. Ah!
It's the way he throws that knife.
Now let's throw it into 'em! Stop shooting', everybody! Stop shooting'! They're ridin' off.
Zeke, this is old Ben Griswell's knife. Well, where'd you find it, boy?
Zeke, this is old Ben Griswell's knife. Well, where'd you find it, boy? Lopez just left it sticking in my bedroll.
And I just recollected, I got a little present for you. Oh, Zeke, what is it? Well, a young fella named Breck Coleman left it with me, and he told me to give it to you in case he didn't show up. Where is it, Zeke?
And I just recollected, I got a little present for you. Oh, Zeke, what is it? Well, a young fella named Breck Coleman left it with me, and he told me to give it to you in case he didn't show up. Where is it, Zeke? I hid it in the holler of the big tree at the bend of the trail.

The tractor can't be standing still. Go! Go on then! Go!
Who is it from? A friend. What's it about?
Who is it from? A friend. What's it about? It's about me.
Far be it from me to read your private mail. With me it's a closed book. Finis. Never bring up the matter again.
Far be it from me to read your private mail. With me it's a closed book. Finis. Never bring up the matter again. It's private.
What are you doing with that? Can't you forget you've seen it?
This is the joint where you're working. And don't you be forgetting it, either. Come on in.
I was wondering if you happened to know anything about it. How should I know anything about it?
- Yeah, but Rico's wreath beat them all. It was big.
If you ain't out of town by tomorrow morning you won't ever leave it except in a pine box. I'm taking over this territory.
Oh, look at that. - Do you like it?
Give it to him, Rico! No. Shoot. Shoot, Rico.
"Reinhold tried to kiss me, and I let him have it!" Let me go! You swine!
The Berolina Statue, the old symbol of Berlin, high above the Alexanderplatz ― they tore it down. It's no longer standing. Why? It was metal on the outside, but hollow inside. But... this little gizmo here ― this gave me the idea. They can knock it down and turn it on its head ― it always gets back on its feet. That's right.

Think about it, folks.
What do you call this masterpiece? I haven't named it yet.
It looks very inviting. Oh, it's nothing serious. Just a small cut from that paper clip.
The Abbey could be very attractive, but I should imagine it would need quite extensive repairs. I shall do very little repairing.
And then I saw two red eyes staring at me, and a white livid face came down out of the mist.
What is it? Who is it, Martin?
I had a terrible dream a few nights ago and I haven't been able to get it out of my mind.
But it's stuffy in here. And that smell.
It's all right, Eva, my love. The cross.
It understands. Watch. Take care now, Frankenstein. Shut out the light. Sit down. Go and sit down. - It understands this time.
Beat it, I tell you! What'd you say? I said beat it! Pardon me. What did you say? I said beat it! He said beat it. Gee, I wish I'd said that.
My aunt thought it would do And what do you think?
My aunt thought it would do And what do you think? That it won't do
I've got it on – A petticoat? She opened her cupboard and gave me a petticoat
You can take it from me. When I get out, I'm going back on the farm. Boy, there's the life.
- Or is it one of Bingy's snowstorms? - It's true all right.
No, it's been all rewritten.
This house is haunted. - No, sir. - Yes. - Have you looked in the closets? - Yes, sir. - Found no skeletons? - No, sir.
- What of it? - Well, they were saying...
I tell you, Michael, it is a wicked business. Why, only last week...
I tell you, Michael, it is a wicked business. Why, only last week... - Got it?
I won't say it. Oh, Bill.
I won't say it. Oh, Bill. If you'd wanted something all your life and fate laid it right in your palm? What would you do?
Here's that piece of cheese. They call it "The Stolen Jools".
Here's that piece of cheese. They call it "The Stolen Jools". Take it away before the Board of Health gets here.
- I think it is, General Shubin. - May I? - Surely.
Would I have taken this if I loved him? What is it? Photographs of his dispatches to Russia. Doesn't that convince you? Yes, I'm quite convinced.
What is it? It would be glorious to go with you but I may never be able to see all those splendid things.
Why, that's a christian name, too. Yes. I liked it.
What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.
Listen to this, the bank was robbed last night. Yeah, over $100,000. Who did it?
I just heard it. Bank's broke. Hurry up. - Closing your account? - Yes, sir.
It doesn't matter who it is.
Is this your signature? Certainly it's my signature. You've seen it often enough. I'm sorry, but I'll have to verify it. Hello, Parker. Listen. I need $1 million in cash, and I've got to have it quick. What?

Take it easy, folks. Everything'll be all right.
Take it easy, folks. Everything'll be all right. But you said it was safe.
It was altogether too big and too bright.
-l thought it was her aunt. -Maybe you are right. Maybe it was her aunt.
That's your bedroom? Yes. Want to see it?
It's terribly expensive here, Heinrich.
The child has come.

Is this your picture? It doesn't look like me.
Is this your picture? It doesn't look like me. - Well, take it away and hang it in my bedroom.
That one up there. It's cute.
I'll not bungle this shot.
It's adorable. I'll take it.
It's adorable. I'll take it. I'm glad you like it.
It's adorable. I'll take it. I'm glad you like it. It's the latest model.
Get out of here and get that piano out of that box! - What were you doing up there?
- I left the boat here for the same reason I took it at Saigon. - What reason?
Say, what's this? Some new kind of an alarm clock? It doesn't seem to ring or tick at all. - Hey! It was a barometer!
Well, I can't believe it. But how does it...
He says it's an awfully rotten area, even for a man. Gary... - Yes? - Maybe I... Well...maybe I'd better go.
- I want it, that's why. Give it back. It's bad money.
I hear you're getting a new car.
How do you like this place? - Kind of gaudy, isn't it? - Ain't it?
- Cesca, what is it?
I owe you my life and I wont forget it. Though, between you and me, it isnt worth much. - This is yours?
I haven't thought about it much. Will you? I thought I hated this country.
It's part of it all. - Love it, don't you?
The description fits. That's our bag. Twenty thousand francs. If I sold it, I would get...
Maybe... Are you sure this is your bag?
- I got it in the saddlebag. You'd better give it to me.
We can settle down for life and live on the fat of the land. Keep your hands where they are. Hand it over.
- You can remember it? - Yes, sir.
- You can remember it? - Yes, sir. - You're not gonna forget it? - No, sir. Do you remember it?
Well, I... I don't see it on you. Of course you don't. Though it's not very far from you.
Well, I... I don't see it on you. Of course you don't. Though it's not very far from you. Well... Well, let me guess where it's hidden. Is it in your bag?
Well, I... I don't see it on you. Of course you don't. Though it's not very far from you. Well... Well, let me guess where it's hidden. Is it in your bag? It's much nearer to me than that.
Well, I... I don't see it on you. Of course you don't. Though it's not very far from you. Well... Well, let me guess where it's hidden. Is it in your bag? It's much nearer to me than that. Is it in your bodice? I know.

If you think of it, bring some cheese. You must come over.
Take a spoon of bicarbonate soda and water. - Yes, sir. Any answer to that message? - No. - Don't send it. This is the last straw! Where's my Stradivarius? - Here. I'll show them they can't fiddle with old Firefly. Look at 'em run! Now we're at war! - Your Excellency! They're fleeing like rats! - But sir... I'll give myself the Firefly medal. You're shooting your own men. - What? You're shooting your own men. Here's 5 dollars. Keep it under your hat.
How can l have it sent? I'll get it dropped over tomorrow. Are you staying a bit? Yes.
- I never heard of it. You wouldn't, Kemp. It's never used now. I didn't know it was even made. It's a drug that's made from a flower that's grown in India. It draws colour from everything it touches. Years ago they tried it for bleaching cloth.
- I know, but it does something else.
- I know, but it does something else. It was tried out on some poor animal - a dog, I believe. It was injected under the skin, and it turned the dog dead white, like a marble statue. - Is that so?
Where's the owner of the bicycle? Here, sir. It was pulled clean out of me hands, sir.
- It was Kemp. It was about Jack.
- It was Kemp. It was about Jack. I know it.
I tell you, there's something on that island that no white man has ever seen. - And you expect to photograph it?
I tell you, there's something on that island that no white man has ever seen. - And you expect to photograph it? - If it's there, you bet I'll photograph it.
It might almost be Egyptian. But what's on the other side of that wall? Who do you suppose could have built it? Oh, I was up on Angkor once.
You understand I admire your country. It's rugged and strong and impressive.
Was this what you brought me down here for?
In the lodge. Fire?
- Why, that's not real fruit! It's imitation! It's made of wax! What has he been doing now? He's been eating that phoney fruit.
I'll bet you can't guess who this is! Alright, who is it? It's your little brother Charlie. Well, for goodness' sake!
They are probably asleep and didn't hear it. We sure were lucky. Do be careful.
It's ridiculous! - It's absurd! - It's the silliest thing I've ever heard. Well, it certainly is.
All you have to do is press the button in the back And it walks out by itself. Isn't it wonderful?
What is it? - I couldn't tell you.
I don't know where it is. And, now ladies and gentlemen, as I was telling... Said...
A gunna gunna A great ahorta
Look at the measurements. Look at that. Look at that. That's the androgynous type.
Have a nice piece of juicy steak.
I got all your copy.
- What time is it? - 8:00. Here. It's a toothbrush, thanks.
- What time is it? - 8:00. Here. It's a toothbrush, thanks. My dress, you had it pressed. Come on. Breakfast will be ready soon. You sweet thing.
- You think it's simple? - No.
I guess that was his only interest in me, wasn't it? - The reward. - I'm sorry you read it. - Are you going to see him? - I suppose so. Certainly.
- What is it? When a woman... You'd know if...
Here, take this. Take it! - Listen...
It's missing a stamp. It's management's fault.
You can fix it, can't you? No.
So this is your car? Okay.
So this is your car? Okay. But from now on, it's mine. Get it?
Green Studebaker, at the Longchamp Hermitage. License plate number... 98 82 RG5. ...82 RG5. Let's get to work!

It won't wait for you! Take that.
It won't wait for you! Take that. It's a green Studebaker-- 98 92--
Oh yeah... this is not a tea room. It's no tennis club either.
In any case, you'll take that car to Marseilles. And quick.
Did you find it at an antique store? It was parked at the university.
It's disloyal to my future husband. Disloyal?
This is his luggage, but I think he's in his cabin.
Throw it down to me, Cheetah. Can't you see I've got nothing on.
Would you feel better if we didn't take the ivory? If we carried it back? Martin, that's sweet of you... but nothing matters anymore.
Pick up that ivory.
That's another one I can't answer now.
I'm glad you're not on this case. On it?
- I was hoping you'd find out who did it. - Maybe I will. - If Wynant...
Lets his lawyer give her money to give to him so she'll think it's blown over.
Lets his lawyer give her money to give to him so she'll think it's blown over. Then when she isn't expecting it, he lets her have it. - No proof? - Nothing as yet to cinch it.
From now on, I'm just out for the ride. I took it from her hand.
It bothered him.
Nick, are you sure one of these people is the killer? Positive. Nick, I can't stand the suspense.
What is it? Just this. Clyde Wynant did not kill Julia. He didn't kill Nunheim or anyone. What are you talking about?
I've been cursed for delving into the mysteries of life. Perhaps death is sacred, and I've profaned it.
It's beating perfectly. Just as in life.
It's beating perfectly. Just as in life. - Oh, if only I can keep it going until...
It's beating perfectly. Just as in life. - Oh, if only I can keep it going until... - It was a very fresh one.
It might have cost you your life. It was fortunate for you that I was here to save you.
Tonight will be a fine night, judging by the sky. There you are, Pitt.
She swore she won't do it again. You won't do it again?
Mr. Byam, look at this bit of meat, sir. It's alive.
It's the ship that's real.
Wonder if that's Defoe Island.
- Did you see me use it? - By no means, lad. Address your replies to the court. Milord, he didn't use the bayonet.
What are you doing in my costume?
Go ahead and read it. - What does it say?
Go ahead and read it. - What does it say? - Go on and read it.
Go ahead and read it. - What does it say? - Go on and read it. - You read it.
Sounds a little better this time. It grows on you.
I have a joint account with my husband and I'd Iike to fix it that nobody can draw the money out but me.
Get off my train!
Now, that's... Let's get inside.
Even if I call, pay no attention to it. Keep that door locked till dawn. Good night.
Even if I call, pay no attention to it. Keep that door locked till dawn. Good night. There it is, Paul. You can just see it through the trees. Dear old Falden.
So you've seen this monster before? Yes.
So you've seen this monster before? Yes. There was something grotesquely familiar about it. Then it suddenly struck me.
I know I had it. Don't worry, darling.
Where'll I put this ice? - Lay it down and don't bother me.
Give it to me. Yes. All right. We'll come. Nickie, I'm sorry.
- What is it, Henry? The telephone?
- All right, I'll give you the money. Tonight?
Selma does decide to get a divorce, how do I know you won't fight it?
- I guess it was me. Did you get him?
- Yes, I mean it. - Of course you're right.
- Yes, I mean it. - Of course you're right. She didn't do it.
- I took this picture. I found it in Pedro's apartment.
I still say, so what's it to me? Just a minute, Lieutenant.
Ask him why he threw your gun away, Selma. He knew that it hadn't been fired. You'd only have to show it to prove your innocence. Yet he threw it away. Ask him why.
You ran a nail through it! Let me hear you sing that again.
I suspected you had a plan. If Colonel Campbell accepts our terms and he would be exceedingly unwise not to it would be very simple.
And I want this necklace.
Dr. Pauquet, I can show you my books.
There's something wrong with my car. I wonder if you can help me.
Don't you like it? Of course.
Don't you like it? Of course. But do you think it goes with those trousers?
I told you how charming and how lovely you were and I'd still repeat it, but I didn't do anything. But you intended to. I did not. You had it in your eye.
It's in the inside pocket of your coat and it isn't chicken anymore.
You know, that's marvellous. I can scarcely believe it. But you're right. It is in my inside pocket.
You see, the necklace that you sold mademoiselle is really very beautiful but too expensive for us, and I'm afraid we'll have to return it.
You see, the necklace that you sold mademoiselle is really very beautiful but too expensive for us, and I'm afraid we'll have to return it. - You have it with you, dear? - Yes, darling.
You see, the necklace that you sold mademoiselle is really very beautiful but too expensive for us, and I'm afraid we'll have to return it. - You have it with you, dear? - Yes, darling. Would it upset you too much if I would ask you to take it back?
Hurry, it's almost daylight.
This story is on every wire in the world right now. Yeah, yeah. Now he's innocent. Yeah.
But I can't do it myself. You'll have to do it for me. You see that? I tore it out of a law book.
But I can't do it myself. You'll have to do it for me. You see that? I tore it out of a law book. My husband says it would be a blessing if the community would forget what happened.
I now draw your attention to this ring.
The shortest road to the village is over the moor.
- You admit it, and you fired him.
- I'm taking your arm. Yes.
- What is it? - Read it. - What does it say?
Give the gentleman a cigar. I don't quite seem to get it. It's your wrist, sir.
Bill, what is it? What is it?
I don't believe it. I won't. Now, Connie, please.
What about this? - It's nothing, Bill. - Yes, what about this? I can explain that thing.
I asked him what he was going to do with the money. Know what he said?
You see, Mr Deeds, the opera is not conducted for profit. - It isn't? What is it conducted for?
- To most people it's an awful let-down. Huh?
- What do you know about that! It's a beautiful little town, too. Grove poplar trees right along main street.
I've been workin' on a poem. It's about you. Sometimes it's kind of hard for me to say things, so I write 'em. I'd like to read it sometime.
- That goo that tastes like soap. Yes, sir.
- Don't come and ask any of it back. You listen to this - when we make an agreement, it is an agreement.
See? See the pretty feather? Sure. Sure.
Bill! Bill, you got my picture. You kept it.
Let's try it again from the beginning. - I'm getting it, aren't I? - Yes.
I'm anxious for Mr. Gordon to see this. It's an interesting experiment. How did you say that last step went?
It's quite an experience. It's more than an experience.
And if you succeed in bringing this good news to your cousin you hope to profit to some extent. Well, I've staked every penny I've got on it.
My assistant, Bailey, had his appendix out last night.
That evidence is going to hang you, Lewis. Unless it was self-defence.
And bring this book as a present.
- You mean, you'll give me the money?
Isn't it the most beautiful day? Is it so beautiful?
Let it stand. - You'll lose it all.
I'll tell you. Because your heart is a thing that can be bought and sold.
But bear witness, I owe her nothing.
But bear witness, I owe her nothing. Take it.
What a lovely song.
What a lovely song. What's the name of it? It has no name.
- Was it so important? - I didn't open it, it was for you.
That's nice.
The beginning is so beautiful, I wonder if the end matters. It's an old tune, but it's still good.
- It was glorious, wasn't it? - And what a hotel.
- It was glorious, wasn't it? - And what a hotel. - Let's forget it. Oh! Oh, no.
It's only one act, but it has everything. Love, jealousy, hate, murder, and all in 35 minutes.
It's an unusual story. I shouldn't mind reading it in a novel.
It may be more than love, or less than love. Well, man, make up your mind. What is it?
It may be more than love, or less than love. Well, man, make up your mind. What is it? It's...
I won't play it. I shall never play it.
- I've changed my mind. Oh, I thought it was only a sub-committee meeting.
Sounds like a description of you. It does, doesn't it? It annoyed me that there should be another woman who looks exactly like me.
I was just trying to make it easier for you, that's all. Did you have to throw that gadget away?
Because I would not be who I am today were it not for you. - I will never forget that.
Because I would not be who I am today were it not for you. - I will never forget that. - I did it for my country. Besides...
Who are you calling a sissy? I'll take care of it. Did you say I was a sissy? I said some people might think eating off of trays was sissy. Well, let's get something to eat anyway, huh, Harvey?
Who are you calling a sissy? I'll take care of it. Did you say I was a sissy? I said some people might think eating off of trays was sissy. Well, let's get something to eat anyway, huh, Harvey? You heard me order it. Go ahead, Charles.
This isn't the way my Treasure Island looks. It's the very first way anybody ever saw Treasure Island. Gee, it's very valuable, huh? Sure.
I don't know what to do with this. He gave it to me.
- I had no idea it was from you. - You kept it, though.
Yes, it was.
- Yes, he practically owns it.
I wouldn't go out in it for anything. By golly, that's smart kid.
We have good times together, eh, little fish? We laugh, we sing, so you smile now. Come on, smile.
Isn't that awfully large for a pill?
I've got it someplace. I know it's someplace. Here.
It's rather a strange-looking sight.
Dr. Hackenbush he's got apple dumpling. No apple dumpling. No, it's no apple dumpling. No. No.
If that nag slips by you, it means your job. Here. Keep me posted.
We should come up in a garden... behind those buildings... It's open country. Slow work.
I admire your care of your geranium. Not because I have turned botanist.
That's splendido, splendido, magnifico! It isn't a party.
It's awful. Please stop them.
Oh, for Pete's sake, get it off your chest. MAN 5: Yeah, loosen up, give out, will you, Nick? - All right, all right. - Come on. So you don't get indigestion. Turkey Morgan's been shooting his mouth off to get Kid Galahad into an early match. You birds said it would draw a million-dollar gate.
The more McGraw cracks him up, the better I'll like it. The old wheeze that he double-crossed you, eh?
- No, I'm sure of it.
No sense to it. What do you make of it, Bob? You must have some idea.
What reason could they have for doing a thing like that? That's what's on the other side of the hill.
We have no money as you know it.
What have my books got to do with it? I saw a man whose life was empty. "A man whose life was empty. "
A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably. With the same amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why? Maybe 'cause you've always been part of Shangri-La without knowing it. - I wonder.
- You think it's nonsense? You've been hypnotised by fanatics. I wouldn't believe it in England.
Do you believe it? Yes. I believe it.
-Not long at all. We met them here on the train. And who did you tell them you were? Spit it out!
is it him? -Obviously it is... not!
But you would have found out about it at some point, and then it wouldn't have been so easy to give it all up. Give it all up? -Of course! Or don't you understand it yet? -No, I understand everything perfectly.
Quite the contrary, we contradicted it, right Macky? We denied and repudiated.
- It's after us. - Don't let it out. Hold it shut. - Now's our chance. Get it now! - Quick! - Give it to it! Don't let it get away! Hold on there.
- It's after us. - Don't let it out. Hold it shut. - Now's our chance. Get it now! - Quick! - Give it to it! Don't let it get away! Hold on there. It's only Dopey.

I... I hope you'll accept my apology. Oh, but think nothing of it. Promise me you'll think nothing of it.
Is it love? Pity? I've a faint suspicion it's more than pity. What a nest for a honeymoon.
Read this. What's this got to do with you?
Will it be necessary to postpone the execution?
Now, this forest is wide.
Does my lady find it interesting? Lady Marian? - Oh, I'm sorry.
Where was it? Oh, Bess, please tell me!
I know, but it's a nice kind of not sleeping. Yes, and it affects your appetite too. Not that I've noticed it's done that to you, except when he was waiting to be hanged.
Unfortunate that interruption in Mrs. Updyke's boudoir would have been a perfect moment for a blood pressure during the robbery.
- We never laid eyes on it, Jo. The papers carry a big story of what's missing.
This loft has been cleaned out perfectly. How about it, Rocks? You got it?
- Suppose the cops get hold of this book? - It's very unlikely.
What's it used for? Well, chiefly insomnia, in minute doses.
May I see it?
- Assume that it has happened. - Well?
I had it for you, only as I said, I didn't expect-- -I know. You said it before. -You don't have to worry about it. -I'm not worried.
You took the dough, made connections built it up. For you and me.
One night, he tried to shoot it out with the cops.
Take $ 100,000 out of my personal account and give it to him. What's up? Is he holding you? -Tell him yes. -Yes.
Why, when you can do it nice and legal? No trouble, no fuss.
It's twice as much as I got. -You wanna make something out of it? -No. No.
It's twice as much as I got. -You wanna make something out of it? -No. No. He deserves it. Why you starting trouble? You pull in your ears. What are we gonna do with it?
I know you forced Frazier to get you $ 100,000. Everybody knows it. What's the difference where the dough came from?
I know you forced Frazier to get you $ 100,000. Everybody knows it. What's the difference where the dough came from? First place, Frazier owed it to me. It's mine.
Sure. Don't you use it over here? Why, of course we do, for puddings. Oh, we use it for weddings.
So, Professor Urganzeff won't talk to a de Loiselle. Well. Yes, sir? Will you step in, please? Yes, Father? Nicole. What happened? You bought it?
- Pardon me, but does it really matter? It was a free-for-all.
That proves it's a CrowFlight. That's mine.
One of us should worry! On top of all this, we've stolen a car!
One of us should worry! On top of all this, we've stolen a car! That's all right. I'll send it back. I don't like it, anyway.
It would go something like this. I'll just prepare for it. Now, let me see.
But don't you think it's a good idea to go back? No, I think it's a good idea to continue our walk.
Someone here has the evil eye.
I swear, Sorgues said nothing.
I wrote it down on the back of an envelope for you. But it's enormous. I'm overcome.
Neddie, play it. Play it, Neddie. Johnny and I can bear it. Can't we?
The next year Mother had me and there was much joy in the land. It was a boy and the fair name of Seton would flourish.
I had it all planned. I was going to....
I had it all planned. I was going to.... Well, it was a good idea.
Then we'll drink a toast to Johnny. He needs it. Needs it? No, I'm wrong.
You wish to occupy yourself otherwise, is that it? Please don't make me feel guilty about it.
You wish to occupy yourself otherwise, is that it? Please don't make me feel guilty about it. Even if it is a fool idea that people dream about and then go flat on.
I feel alive and I love it. I feel at last something's happening to me.
- I don't think it matters a bit what I think.
And I believe that its path that is to say the course of true love, contrary to the adage, should run smooth. I am a man of 58 years and speak from a long experience and observation.
If that position at the bank is still open I'll be glad to take it. I'm still not convinced.
And does it have to be so tight here? - It binds. And the skirt...
It's no joking matter. Looks mighty serious. More cases than you hear about.
Pres is coming home. Of course. Did you know it?
Major Crandall's dead with it, for one.
Major Crandall's dead with it, for one. Ned Warrington's got it. No telling how many others.
I imagine Buck finds it so.
I just kind of found me a double-end boat. It ain't like I stealing, Miss Julie.
You win. This calls for action.
She likes you. I'm as popular as a dose of strychnine.
Heaven knows what the government will say about it. -Nothing at all.
Are you an artist? I wish I was. I love the arts.
The grocery should've been ashamed of me. Come on, it's not such a drama.
I'm thinking of it now. I'll dream of it. By noon tomorrow, I'll have found, rented or bought it all.
But laughter itself. It's an absurd, vulgar convulsion. Don't speak ill of laughter.
Here's a new one, Ed. Taste it.
Everyone's talking about it. Somebody's buying up everything here.
That's the reason I've lived in this house so many years and could never move out.
No, because eight years ago, a typewriter was delivered to the house by mistake. If it had been a plough, she'd have taken up farming, huh?
- How much is it? - Ten cents.
It's in my throat. It's fighting to get out.
It's in my throat. It's fighting to get out. I can't hold it back any longer.
- See if Rheba has enough sauerkraut. - All right. - Tell Donald to hurry. - Yes.
The idea of you engineering this thing and being caught in your own trap.
I'll get over it. "But, my darlings, I'm so lonesome for you.
- You ought to know it. - Polly Wolly Doodle? We drove you almost crazy with it once.
- You ought to know it. - Polly Wolly Doodle? We drove you almost crazy with it once. You know it, of course you do.
This little thing is one of the wonders of the ages. It's a screwdriver, a bottle opener, a cheese slicer, ice pick and vegetable parer.
You're supposed to be a very dangerous character. They told me that a man with your record would never go straight. I'm glad that you proved them wrong. Keep it up, kid.
Let's skip it, huh?
But we got it over the grapevine. A bigshot was coming up. And the screws wouldn't answer no questions. And then, after lights out... Yeah...
You mean you didn't know it? She's been making a sap out of you all this time? I didn't say nothing, Joe.
You haven't dropped in like this for a long time, Sir Ronald. I've come to consult you on a rather peculiar matter. Thank you no, no. Now just have a look at that. Doesn't it strike you that the handwriting is... Yes, yes. That's because it's written with the left hand. "Star of Delhi will never reach the Tower of London." Curious, and anonymous. And what is the Star of Delhi? Probably the largest emerald in the world, a gift to her majesty from the Maharajah of Rapur. Oh, I shouldn't worry about this, Sir Ronald.
The sap's not dry yet. That means it was torn off within the last few hours. Ah. What have you found, Holmes? It's a watch fob. Looks like a rabbit's foot. No, no, no.
- Now, Nickie, this is important. This is your responsibility.
Not much chance of fingerprints... after the dog's been playing with it for nobody knows how long. I'm apologizing.
- Well, I guess that does it. - Does what?
It'll be right up. You're telling me. Room service, please. There's a man outside, he wants to see you. I put him in the study. - I thought Mrs. Bellam might be here. - I don't know where she is. Can I do something? I just wanted someone to keep an eye on Nickie. - Let me. - That's very nice, but I... - Lois should get some sleep anyway. - Well, thank you very much.
- I'll get it. No, Mrs. Bellam, you stay here.
Look, Nickie, it's smoking. It worked. Give me that rod.
When Phil was trying to get money out of him... I found we spoke the same language. I'm not sorry for it.
Now, I take out my money. I count it. What happens? Punchy, what's the matter for you?
Here, hold that.
- How 'bout me handling it?
It's breakfast. Breakfast, huh?
You should've seen the parasol that came with it. - About the size of a pie. - Ohh! It must've been darling. Make the most of it today.
Would I go under the ground? No, there's no future in it! - Miss Frenchy, honey, you know that blue dress? Well, you can't wear it no more. It's got beer on it.
- You liked it, huh? - Yeah, it was all right!
- It's a mighty fine thing when a man realizes he's wrong... and tries to correct it in a nice way.
That's great. It will just put me in the mood.
But you mustn't drink it all at once, because it is the last. I meant it, my dear.
It's over! It's over!
I couldn't let you do anything like that. Anyway, it's done now.
So I'll change the subject and say what I came to say. Say it, then, and get out!
I can keep the lumber business too?
My mammy said when she went to heaven she wanted a red taffeta petticoat so stiff that it'd stand by itself and so rustley the Lord would say it's made of angels' wings. She won't take it from you. She'd rather die than wear it. That may be. But I'm making the gesture just the same. [CRYING] RHETT: Wake up. Wake up! You were having another nightmare. Rhett, I was so cold and hungry and so tired.
That was fine.
I don't want it any more than you do. No woman would want the child of a cad like you.
It's no use.
It seems we've been at cross purposes, doesn't it?
It's awfully dusty, sir. I'll see to it for you, sir.
- Searchlight's got it.
A hound? Why didn't you report it? Not a soul would have believed it.
I found this: This old document. Legend of the hound of the Baskervilles. Let me read it to you, Mr. Holmes.
Oh, nothing sir, it was the window. The window?
Oh, nothing sir, it was the window. The window? Yes, sir I was just seeing that it was fastened. What does it matter whether it is fastened or not? A window on the second floor. I go around every night seeing that they are fastened. Sir Charles always insisted upon it. Well that sounds reasonable enough.
It's gone now. There it is again. and there it goes. Just as I thought. Barryman was signalling someone. Come on get some clothes we'll find out. It's still there. Yes
While only yesterday one of the moor ponies wondered into it.
While only yesterday one of the moor ponies wondered into it. Turn me sick with horror to see it struggling and the sound of its screams... What's that? Oh, that.
Tomorrow we will be away from this place. I wish it were now. So do I. Oh, now don't be silly Good night, Beryl. Good night, dear.
What's the matter with the Hunchback? You see?
I'm glad it happened. Changes a lot of ideas I've had about you. I'm glad, too.
To go away and leave such a fascinating husband around loose. I don't like to tell you this, dear, but... Then I'm sure I won't want to hear it, darling.
Look, dear, do you think I like it? Don't you think it means as much to me as it does to you?
Look, dear, do you think I like it? Don't you think it means as much to me as it does to you? I don't know whether it does or not.
About time we came up with it. - Look to starboard.
And I'll ride up the capitol steps if I feel like it. So you talked it over, huh? Without me. Well, I don't like it, and it ain't the way I aim to have things.
I said is there an armoire in that room? Of course there is.
Lead painting's no good, just like the sand gun. When I couldn't fight it anymore, I just gave in.
I've never seen this before. - Beautiful, isn't it?
I've never seen this before. - Beautiful, isn't it? - Yes, it is.
But you must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles. Look at it.
I see a house. Looks like any other house. - What's remarkable about it?
It's the spirit that dwells within it. It has three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
The other one says, "Sure it's true, about 500 million." Then the first one says:
Maybe it's in here. - Just a little knob.
I haven't said a word.
Just look out of the window and there it is. And it's great.
That's another thing.
Isn't it wonderful? - Tell us, Ninotchka. - Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski--
Isn't it wonderful? - Tell us, Ninotchka. - Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski-- Now, please don't start figuring it out in cows.
It may be waiting for you in a corridor. It may hide in the shadow of a minaret.
I brought this for you. Funny.
It's in her family, isn't it? I thought everybody knew that too.
- Why haven't you mentioned this plan?
Yes, reminded you of a great, beautiful bird, didn't it? It didn't at all.
Yes, reminded you of a great, beautiful bird, didn't it? It didn't at all. That's why it's so wonderful.
But one night when I was lost in a fog and was glad to get back down, what do you think the welcome-home speech was? She'd hoped I'd crashed. - What? - She couldn't stand the gaff.
But one night when I was lost in a fog and was glad to get back down, what do you think the welcome-home speech was? She'd hoped I'd crashed. - What? - She couldn't stand the gaff. Said she'd rather see me dead, have it over with.
- I slipped on the porch. - Don't walk around on it.
And had I that duty, Her Majesty's conduct has canceled it. As for asking her pardon, why should I ask pardon for receiving an insult? " Stop it! No. No, go on.
But it's doubtful if he'll come.
I'll put an end to it. Not another man goes to Ireland.
Even in my retreat, news came of that silver armor of yours. -I was ill.
This deficit has grown to alarming proportions.
If I fail to crush Tyrone, take my sword.
Essex, thinking himself forgotten turned against you, but it wasn't his fault. He didn't know.
Wouldn't it have been kinder to have left me with my thoughts? Are you so set on dying?
It's mainly a matter of equipment.
How could you have refused him this small mark of loving friendship that he must have been begging for?
-They're nice but very damaging. Here, look. How beautiful!
Does it surprise you? -Christine has disappeared! -She disappeared.
Try this. Now, stoop down. Don't let it fall. That's the way they teach you in dancing school. I don't know.
You must be very fond of that piece. They've played it every time we've danced.
Honest. I won't do it anymore. Please don't stop dancing.
- I have to see Mr. Big Eagle somehow, before it gets dark. - It won't do any good, Sue. It will.
Never heard of it. A very rare animal.
Never heard of it. A very rare animal. The old-time hunters used to think it was a cross between a giraffe and a zebra.
Whenever it's convenient. We shall be about here for a day or two.
If it's ivory the party's after... the hunter in charge usually gets 10% of whatever they bring out. Very well.
I hear a beat How sweet! Just to register emotion Jealousy, devotion And really feel the part
This is a spell, this is! It's the Wicked Witch! What'll we do? Help! Help!

But that's so easy! I should've thought of it for you.
And me Hickory? You couldn't forget my face, could you?
But, Sylvia, suppose Mary should hear about it? Wouldn't it be terrible?
- Don't tell me, but how much is it? - Two hundred and twenty-five.

What's the matter? I don't want it.
Mr. Haines wants to know if he can have the portrait of Little Mary. - Oh, yes, but it's in storage.
- Here it is, my lady.
- Then what's it doing in the bathroom? - Nothing. It turns into a bathroom. Then another time it turns into a kitchenette. Another time into a fireplace. You can't light it but it looks awful cute. - What turns into a fireplace? - This gig in the corner.
- You said it. When you've got it right in your mitts, they leave you with your tongue hanging out.
I demand an explanation, and it had better be good. It is very good, sir.
The crank fits on here and when you turn it it... Makes into a full-size double bed at night. Guy said it works swell. What did you go get that for?
The crank fits on here and when you turn it it... Makes into a full-size double bed at night. Guy said it works swell. What did you go get that for? Well, we kinda hoped that it might make up for the... phoney telegram.
That is where our story ends.
What's the matter with that hat? It cost a lot of money.
- No, it wasn't a pigeon. It was green. Must have been a frog.
That's rich and rare. A business transaction, Joe.
You can't miss it. Say, you can do me a favor. I got a telegram for Dan Wilson.
Sure, we'll deliver the telegram.
That means we don't open it. You promise? Right. All right.
You wanna hear how it happened? That's what I' asking you, ain't it?
This is my land! Used to be.
What's so funny about it? I've just been out there.
Only, it's for an old lady. No teeth.

I had a publicity job offered to me last year.
It's Bruce's money and I want it back. Bruce's money?
My wallet? This is my wallet. Say, there's something funny going on... What are you doing?
If it was my own grandmother, I'd carry on. - You know I would, for the paper.

Darling, you've done something to this sleeve. A cigarette burn. That's what it is. And your new coat too. Never mind.
So, this bird killed the black-breasted red? - Yes, Your Excellency.
This should do it. This should suit that maniac.
It's paranoiac.
The fuss you made over that childish episode!
Without that, you might as well be made of bronze. That's an awful thing to say to anyone.
Do you know what time it is? It's after 4.
Wasn't it funny?

So you have taken it upon yourself to remedy the defects of Spanish justice? Insofar as it lies within my power, yes, Your Grace.
I'm on the grape-juice wagon. Antro.
Does he laugh by the hour, or is it piecework? You had a good laugh the other night too, didn't you?
Can't you do something about it? - What's that? - Oh, that? Uh, nothing. Uh...
If he didn't kill you, you'd do it yourself.
No, Mr. Matuschek, it's not for us. But you haven't listened to it.
It's quite a bit of money. Yeah, all right.

It was in my house you were cared for, to sleep your sleep... and dream to its end... your first dream of love. It was I who woke you. No.
When you're through with that, I'd like to have it back. I'd like to keep that particular piece of paper myself.

Then straight to Mrs Tossal the Shop, for that toffee which you could chew for hours, it seems to me now. And even after it had gone down, you could swallow and still find the taste of it hiding behind your tongue. It is with me now, so many years later.
At least I am not sitting on it, talking rubbish in chapel. - Look here...
What is it, Huw? I can't make sense with it.

But Dundy's getting a little rambunctious, and maybe it is a bit thick this time. What'll it cost to be on the safe side?
But I haven't got the falcon. I'll have it in another week at the most, though.
It's you who bungled it. You and your stupid attempt to buy it! Kemidov found out how valuable it was!

I admired your stone door so much that I imitated it... by wedging another stone on the outside. You're sealed up, as in a grave.

Can you give it to me? No, I gotta give it to him. I'm going away, see?
I'm glad you like my perfume. It's new.
I found this hidden in Barrow's apartment. While I was there, Miss Porter came in. She'd been there before. That's a lie!
Nicky, I can't stand it! Was it me?
Nicky, I can't stand it! Was it me? Yeah, Nick, is it her?
He'll get over it.
You needn't get mad about it. Here. - I ain't no place to hide it. - Tom says I was to give it to you. I'd be scared to hold all that. I ain't never had no money.
I ain't gonna touch it. Keep the money or throw it away.
I couldn't stand it if you got down on me too. Is it something you done?
You mean the box can talk? Not really.
Is there any more of it? There's lots of it on the bottom. Lots of it. What do you do with it?
It's a new drug that works wonders in cases such as this. - Elliott's already sent a runner for some. - Where?
What about that wood? Well, there it is, can't you see it?
What about that wood? Well, there it is, can't you see it? How come I can still see it?
That's the fourth time you've taken that same load to town and brung it back. Ain't even had it out of the car.
How much rent would it be, Payne? Hundred dollars for the year. Hundred dollars?
Oh, ain't this a pretty automobile? Oh, I knew you could do it, Dude boy.
- I know, but it don't seem just right. Wait a minute.
- I know, but it don't seem just right. Wait a minute. I ain't stealing it. I'm just figuring on selling it and giving Henry half of that money.
- Did you hurt the car much? - Oh, not the running of it. - And the horn wasn't hurt none.
- Yeah, it's brand-new. It ain't been hardly broke in yet.
This is my place, boy. Maybe I did, but I had to do it.
I wanted you to have it very much, and so I bought it for you. This couldn't be a diamond bracelet, could it?
The funny thing was that when my wife found that in my pocket she thought that I was the one who bought it for you. How could you possibly think such a thing? Because I know Martin.
The funny thing was that when my wife found that in my pocket she thought that I was the one who bought it for you. How could you possibly think such a thing? Because I know Martin. Do you like it, Sheila? Like it?
That bracelet happens to mean an awful lot to me.
That bracelet happens to mean an awful lot to me. It brought us together.
That bracelet happens to mean an awful lot to me. It brought us together. Well, that's one way of looking at it.
This happens to be my apartment. I'm sorry. I didn't know.
You telling me the truth? It's better than that. I think it's great. May I take it with me?
You telling me the truth? It's better than that. I think it's great. May I take it with me? I wanna read it again myself. Sure.
Bert read me his play. It's superb. It's not just a play by a newspaperman.
Bert read me his play. It's superb. It's not just a play by a newspaperman. It's really superb, cries out for Cornell.
I've been reading the most brilliant play with an enchanting part in it for you. - Why, you're on-stage every minute. - Darling. What? Darling, why do I have to come there?
But I wanted you to have it. It's a picture of me as I used to be.
But I wanted you to have it. It's a picture of me as I used to be. It was taken on another Christmas Eve many years ago.
- Yes, the name of this little device. Inflato, taken from the word "inflation."
Let me try, see if I can't get this thing...
I'm doing the masterminding in this show, Mr. Dante. And hand over that gun you fired at the coffin. I am holding you too. - Ridiculous. Stanley, there's been a... Stanley. Oh, Stanley. Stanley. Oh, Stanley. Well, what happened, sir? - Somebody slugged me. - Oh, well that's too bad.
- I'lI get it from the safe. I'm so upset. You know-
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By." I can't remember it. I'm a little rusty on it. I'll hum it for you.
That's the way it goes. One in, one out. - Sam. - Yes, boss.
You played it for her, you can play it for me. - I don't remember-
You played it for her, you can play it for me. - I don't remember- - If she can stand it, I can.
Can I tell you a story, Rick? Has it got a "wow" finish? I don't know the finish yet.
This is not our home. It's not our fight.
So this is Holiday Inn. Yeah, will be if it ever opens up.
Come on, let's get out of this before you catch cold. All right. Oh! Well, here's what cooks. Oh! Why, this is darling.
Well, I thought it over, and I believe our number would go better in blackface.
Well, I thought it over, and I believe our number would go better in blackface. Oh, I thought we were gonna do it like this. Well, that was before I... before I thought it over. I'll look terrible in the stuff. No.

What'll I do with the coat? When you're through with it, send it to the police.
Now, you get back in that body. No. I didn't like it.
This statement says the corporation's dissolved.
I'll never stand in their way. Craig's a lawyer.
Where'd you get it? Ask no questions.
Besides, it is Stanley's car. It's just standing idle in the garage.
If it hadn't been for me, he'd still be alive. He'd still be alive.
What is the matter, Stanley? Stanley, what is it?
Would you explain this to me? It's Peter's.
- Oh, Stanley, it wasn't. It couldn't have been.
- Has she ever mentioned this to you? - Well she may have intimated it...
This time I've not deserved it.
- It's not hot, it's cold. The plumbers disconnected it. I-I wouldn't mind if they hadn't!
He got it three times filled, and running over. But those who has so longed for it were not there to see it.
It's later, making it happen, that it's difficult. What's that? Leave it. I took it from a friend with dark thoughts.
I won't say it again, Gloria. Sorry.
One of them in particular hurt me.
The bracelet you gave me for our 5th anniversary, I lost it. I was still kidding myself. For a moment, I thought she'd tell me everything. She'd actually pawned her bracelet for money.
And they're trying it on. It's only human. They're going back tomorrow.
I can't do these baby clothes.
It's impossible. It's despicable.
It was you. Gloria, please. Gloria, open up.
Make a note of it. Significant, isn't it?
This morning I referred to a quotation, remember? Yes, Walt Whitman's.
Will you excuse me to send a cable to my wife? I should have this morning. Isobel gets nervous. Of course.
How much farther is it? Don't look, just listen.
Where did you get that dress? Lisa and I bought it in New York. Outrageous. Where's the black and white foulard?
You see, it's strong and safe. It's simple and practical. It lets the light and air through and it's practically invisible from below.
My patent is basic. $99,000 is a lot of money.
He just... $700 just like that? Just like that. I mean, sex didn't even enter into it. Oh, but of course it did, darling.
This is very illuminating. Well, you don't have to get rigid about it.
Well, I don't think he'll ever get it.
It would be nice if something came of it. Oh, yes, wouldn't it?
It would be nice if something came of it. Oh, yes, wouldn't it? It would be wonderful for him.
I didn't realize it was so humorous. Did you really want to put me through all that? I'm afraid I'm...
I didn't realize it was so humorous. Did you really want to put me through all that? I'm afraid I'm... There's no use trying to conceal it now.
Why should he build it? I'll build it.
He didn't want that, I wanted it for him. But...
You know about Gerry's decision? Yes.
That he could take you in his arms, you could still laugh, and mean it. We did prove it, didn't we?
I wouldn't believe a word you said if you swore it on a stack of Bibles. I'm goin' whole hog for the miner. I'm gonna make Pittsburgh... the greatest town to work and live in in America! Nah. The boat sailed, Pittsburgh, and you're not on it. Nobody'll ever like or trust you again. We'll see about that. I'll make 'em like me.
You need care, and you need doctors that understand your case.
Isn't it wonderful? Sam's all right. Now you have nothing to worry about, nothing.
Aren't you ever going to tell me what's in it? I can't believe it. It's fantastic. Darling, please, I can't stand it another second.
Aren't you ever going to tell me what's in it? I can't believe it. It's fantastic. Darling, please, I can't stand it another second. It's from Liverpool, from the editor of The Mercury.
Do you like it? My dear, you look adorable.
Would it be too incredible? - It would be fantastic.
Would it be too incredible? - It would be fantastic. - Then it is fantastic.
Why? Is it so startling? It may sound outrageous to you, but it's not a sudden impulse.
It's port. That's larboard to me.
- Jack, that paper has your name on it. - What?
Was it Drusilla? Yes.
The wreck moved!
He handed me the extinguisher. Ken said, "Don't I get to play too?" He was kidding. I handed it to him. Fry was right there with us, I'm sure!
Did you leave your car down on the road? Put it in the shed.
It's not gonna be easy.
It's not gonna be easy. If you can't handle it, I'll have to get someone else.
I'm glad we came this way. It adds a few miles, but I've become a little sentimental. I want to take a last look at it.
This must be a big moment for you, huh? Oh, it is.
This is Miss Eberli. Why...why someone must have stolen it.
They found my car on Richmond Bypass wrecked.
You realize, of course, when I was brought into the room blindfolded - I heard the mechanism of this door. - Of course.
For me I'm British and I'm proud of it. Nobody is gonna call me a Nazi and get away with it. Well, help me then. Tell me what Christopher means. Well, don't anybody know? Its got to mean something.
There's something curious about this broadcast. He said tomorrow.
- Percentage is with the house. Pretty hard to beat. But it has been done, hasn't it? So they tell me.
-Yeah, that's what they call it. We've got a different name for it. - My uncle must have signed it. Which doesn't make it so funny. - Why not?
You're still wearing it, I see. It's becoming. You've grown into it. And what's that? - It's the coffee boiling. - Take it off.
It's a Polish dish. With an egg in it.
It's a Polish dish. With an egg in it. Don't let anybody give it to you without an egg in it. - We must have some, Miss Shelley. - Of course. As soon as I finish my course in American cooking...
With an egg in it.
What the dickens is that to you? Nothing.
Why should Dilg go to jail?
Queer, wasn't it? The way it suddenly shot up above the clouds? Another couple of feet, we'd smack right into it. - Still looks like Africa to me.
Don't you know that? Don't you feel it? If anything happened to you...
Don't you know that? Don't you feel it? If anything happened to you... You think I can do it?
Then I-Then it-it-it closed in on me like- like a blast from a furnace. Only it wasn't hot, it- it was-
Then I-Then it-it-it closed in on me like- like a blast from a furnace. Only it wasn't hot, it- it was- It was simply horrible.
Then I-Then it-it-it closed in on me like- like a blast from a furnace. Only it wasn't hot, it- it was- It was simply horrible. Kate screamed again and... then I was fighting it.
I'm sure by tomorrow the police will find out what it was. I've done it, Bob.
If you want to know more about it, there's a family history in the library. Thanks. I'll have a look at it.
- I'm not convinced it is a man. - A woman? Animal, vegetable or mineral?
That's what stops me, but what do you make of this? I found this during my first investigation at the scene of the crime. Obviously the hair of a large animal. A dog, perhaps. All right. Get the spectrum slide of wolf's hair out of my case while I mount this. That shows the spectrum analysis of wolf's hair. - And here's the one I found. - It's incredible. Well, Inspector, that blows up your spook theory. What's happened? It was sealed in this tube and vacuum.
Either you injected the cobra venom into Kate O'Malley's veins... or you deliberately withheld the information... that venom was in the system at the coroner's inquest. There was no reason for mentioning it. Had no bearing on the case. She didn't die from the venom.

There was no reason for mentioning it. Had no bearing on the case. She didn't die from the venom. - But you did inject it into her veins. - No.
For a moment I thought you were the monster. Quick.
That book telling the history of the family had a hint in it. Oh, so you were the one who stole it. Yes. Yes, I'd hoped to keep you from finding out. That their ancestors were balmy?
That book telling the history of the family had a hint in it. Oh, so you were the one who stole it. Yes. Yes, I'd hoped to keep you from finding out. That their ancestors were balmy? Well, let us say, rather, that their ancestors... handed it down from father to son throughout the ages.
Oh, don't take it wrong, Mrs. Craig. I'm just so excited.
Tess, I hope it's a boy. - Oh, you sweet...
Tess, I hope it's a boy. - Oh, you sweet... - It is a boy.
You saw it once.
We're not leaving without it. I've had experience. Hand it over. Tell you where his money is if you're so anxious.
All hands to the cargo winch! Bring your guns to starboard and hold fire.
But did that discourage them?
It's true, that beast came to hurt us. It's an innocent animal.
- That's nonsense. It's true, that beast came to hurt us. It's an innocent animal. It's Beelzebub! He should be judged. Because of him, Sisters commit mortal sins. They rightly hate him. He steals, hates us all, is a burden. But Mother St John likes him. They pet him for her, kick him behind her back. Beelzebub proudly walks around. Look in his eyes, see a path of lies and hypocrisy! Sister! A bluebird used to come here, it brought joy and sincerity. And a toad that made us feel compassionate. Mother St John's cat ate them.
I loved the world I left. You don't know how much I loved it. I ripped it from my heart to come here.
What's it called? That is called the "Dance of the Pelican" my own original creation. Now, girls, we'll try some bar exercises. Right over here.
You can take Jasper along as your croaker. Croaker?
He had some money in the bank, and he wouldn't draw it out. And you know what? He lost his job.
This is really something. All ready? Now, we'll dirty it up a little.
So the bridge is nothing.
- If he catches a fox, he'll call it an elephant. - And if I catch an elephant?
- If you see one soldier, raise your rifle like this.
- Can you make it to Navacerrada? - I can try.
When I stirred up the fire for coffee, I found it. - What? - It was under the ashes. - I thought you were guarding it. - I slept with your things! - You slept well!
You tell it to A... A entrust it to B, B confines in C...
Raise the invisible torch and pass it along... Keep it burning...
- Let's see now. ls it a tie? - l'm not telling. I'll give you a hint.
Mother, I want you to look at this. - Do you think Martha will like it? - Oh, it's beautiful.
To me it came that night... after Paul Holland had almost thrust me from the room... certainly from his life. I said I love him. Even as I said it, I knew he still loved his wife. And then, because I loved him, I felt I had to restore her to him... to make her what she'd been before... to make him happy. All that you say comes to the same thing. You are asking me to pass a sentence of life or death on my wife. Insulin shock treatment is an extreme measure, Paul... as Miss Connell pointed out when she suggested it to me, but... You admit that this is terribly dangerous. So why do you advise it? I've worked with it. I've seen cures. It's at least a hope. It's the very danger itself, Paul, that makes the cure possible. Insulin produces a state of coma. Then the patient is revived by a violent shock to the nerves. That shock can kill, but it can also cure. I don't know. It's a hard decision to make, but yours is only a technical responsibility. Technical responsibility. Real responsibility. The question is, will she live or die?
Isn't very likely, is it? I don't mean believe in it like believing in a religion.
Isn't very likely, is it? I don't mean believe in it like believing in a religion. I mean, do you believe it has power?
He's even used a copy of the Daily Planet. He never dropped it on the floor?
That money belongs to Miss Cowan. You know very well you stole it from her mother. Why, you.
No, no, no, it wouldn't be there. It's a large manuscript in a portfolio.
You don't understand, mademoiselle. It's the only copy I have. It represents two years' work. You heard what the lady said.
You don't understand, mademoiselle. It's the only copy I have. It represents two years' work. You heard what the lady said. But it was brought into this office.
It's not from an opera, Raoul. It's a lullaby. A lullaby.
Make it snappy.
Waco, get some cans and some ropes from the tank. Heads up. Here it comes.
How's it coming? Very good, Sergeant. Very nice.
How's it coming? Very good, Sergeant. Very nice. Any way to squeeze it out quicker?
How's it coming? Very good, Sergeant. Very nice. Any way to squeeze it out quicker? It takes its own time.
Let me take your place for a while. No, it isn't necessary. How's it coming?
- It is from my village. Never heard of it.
You hit it right on the nose.
I look at it this way. Because it is a 100-to-1 shot. Because there's so little chance of any of us coming out of it.
It broadens the mind. I wish you weren't so cocky about it.
There it is! Drink all you can find! Go on, take it!
There it is! Drink all you can find! Go on, take it! There it is! Roll in it! Swim in it!
Sometimes I get a tune in my head like that and pretty soon, I hear somebody else humming it too. I think tunes jump from head to head. Do you know whatit is, Uncle Charlie? Uh, no.
OK? And you tear it down here. And you tear it there. You fold it over here at the side. Fold over the other side here.
Watson, get your sedative.
Musgrave ritual, they call it.
"Who first shall find it were better dead
"Who first shall find it were better dead Who next shall find it perils his head. The last to find it defies dark powers."
"Who first shall find it were better dead Who next shall find it perils his head. The last to find it defies dark powers." "Who first shall find it were better dead. Who next shall find it perils his head.
Well, sir I memorized it. Obviously but why?
Not the room, Watson. Her mind. We must search her mind. Obviously, she took great pains to hide that paper.
I'll kiss the book on it. I've got it. She must have packed that paper under this cushion. She must have changed her mind. Obviously.
I'll kiss the book on it. I've got it. She must have packed that paper under this cushion. She must have changed her mind. Obviously. Well she could have hidden it anywhere here.
What we're looking for is underneath here that's what the ritual meant by deep down low. It's a burial crypt. Up with it. I say, there's somebody down there.
What we're looking for is underneath here that's what the ritual meant by deep down low. It's a burial crypt. Up with it. I say, there's somebody down there. Who is it?
Who is it, Holmes?
I grant you. But it wasn't easy to let you take my gun away from me without seeming to hand it to you. That's why I let you take the torch first. I knew you'd snap it off. Yes. We told you, you were taking an awful risk. Well we had to have a confession and these egomaniacs are always so much more chatty when they feel they have the upper hand. Shall we go?
I wonder why he left the grant down there where he found it.
Watson this microscope was last used for examining microfilm. I'm beginning to see the pattern.
What do you mean? They want us to believe that they found the document and therefore have no further use for Grayson. Well if that's true then we're done for.
If they have the document why they wasting time sending me this? No.
This blanket has had a most varied history. It's been on a many a sea voyage. The latest not six months ago.
Now would you just give me the address where you want it sent? Mrs. J. Wellington, Junior, Duponte Circle. Good night.
Moorish. Oh, my error.
Look at that tree. Yes, it bows in sorrow. No, in longing.
Look at that tree. Yes, it bows in sorrow. No, in longing. It grieves over us.
Isn't it lovely to think about? Yes.
Isn't it lovely to think about? Yes. It is only a dream. What does it matter?
I have wished it hundreds of times. I wished it when you were with me.
I have wished it hundreds of times. I wished it when you were with me. I wished it when you left me.
Ratty old chair, ain't it? Repulsive. Well, sir, there's nothing ratty about it. Perhaps you're right, doctor.
A registered package for Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Oh, he'll sign for it. Thank you, sir.
I really shouldn't, but I must see it. Oh, how simply breathtaking. You like it? Why I'm mad about it.
I really shouldn't, but I must see it. Oh, how simply breathtaking. You like it? Why I'm mad about it. You must let me take it back to the jeweler, have it properly marked. AS or just Andrea?
Look at that. What of it?
Yes, isn't it? I picked it up quite by accident.
Yes, isn't it? I picked it up quite by accident. Wasn't a mark on it except some negligible fingerprints that the police couldn't identify.
Keep out of this! It's between us. You got something to tell me... You're wasting your time. - You know what's going to happen to him?
How did the poison get in the wine?
I'll tell you why I called you. It's about Teddy. I've got to come over and see you right away.
I'd like to see the room.
Dear me! This will be a shock to the General. No, we must keep it a secret. A state secret? Yes, a state secret. Promise? You have the word of the President of the United States. Cross my heart and hope to die. Now, let's see.
That won't have any effect. I've tried it before--
Sometimes it goes on like that all night. - Really? - Yes. Maybe we'd better go to your house, huh? No, dear.
- What does it say? - I can't read it. I haven't got my glasses. - Here, hold this. I'll climb up and I'll see. - Never mind, I'll climb up.
Gee, that's swell. That's a wonderful machine.
- I call it the Big Noise. - Why? Because, properly detonated, it would blow up this entire city. What do you want us to do with it? I don't want you to do anything with it, except to guard it with your lives. The utmost secrecy must be observed.
- I call it the Big Noise. - Why? Because, properly detonated, it would blow up this entire city. What do you want us to do with it? I don't want you to do anything with it, except to guard it with your lives. The utmost secrecy must be observed. If the wrong people learned what I have in mind and it was discovered, it might alter the whole course of the war.
How does it fly? That's just what I'm working on. Good night. He must have given me the wrong key.
How does it fly? That's just what I'm working on. Good night. He must have given me the wrong key. - Let me try it now. Maybe I can fix it. - All right.
- I'll handle this. - Yes. Come on. That's deep enough.
It will be flown directly over this battery and you will attempt to blow it out of the sky. All right, sergeant, start the plane.
I made this myself, Mr. Cody. I hope you'll enjoy it.
What is it? What did I say to offend you?
What is it? What did I say to offend you? Please, I'd rather you kept it.
What is it? What did I say to offend you? Please, I'd rather you kept it. It was so becoming to you.
Diphtheria. What's that?
Diphtheria. What's that? It's a germ. Where does it come from? From water systems. From sewage.
Lend me your car for a while?
You said it wasn't an accident. Check.
You said it wasn't an accident. Check. You said it wasn't suicide. Check.
That perfume on your hair. What's the name of it? I don't know.
But right then it gave me a nasty feeling to be thinking about them at all... with that briefcase right behind my head that had her father's signature in it... and what that signature meant. It meant he was a dead pigeon.
Look, we're not gonna grab a hammer and do it quick, just to get it over with. - There are other ways.
We had a cabin there.
If the cocoa is not sweet enough for you... It's fine, it's fine.
With it. You pig. What will you give me for the "Mecklenburg"? Have you doubled it? But it's not genuine. Show me. On one end it goes back and forth, and on the other end it goes around. That is the connecting rod. Sometimes this kind of steam engine has two cylinders.
It was your idea.
I'll point out the window of the room in Number 9 where it happened.
With the sun rising, lighting your hair as it is now. I don't know how it ends.
That piano traveled with her everywhere in the great days.
I'm afraid the pin is not very strong. - No.
Nancy, did you turn the gas up in there? Turn it up? No, why?
Nancy, did you turn the gas up in there? Turn it up? No, why? I thought it went down in here, as if you had.
The little picture has been taken down. Who took it down? - Why has it been taken down? - Why indeed? Why was it taken down before?
The little picture has been taken down. Who took it down? - Why has it been taken down? - Why indeed? Why was it taken down before? Get it from wherever you've hidden it and put it back in its place.
Don't look at me like that.
I think it's the most...
Then it really happens. I thought I imagined it.
I know it. I know it. But he was here.
You see how it is, Elizabeth? Yes, sir.
Look, in the drawer of that cupboard there is a knife.
Would you get it, Paula?
Would you get it, Paula? Would you get it for me?
Would you get it, Paula? Would you get it for me? Yes, I'll get it.
- I must look for it, mustn't I?
- I must look for it, mustn't I? If I don't find it, you will put me in the madhouse.
- I must look for it, mustn't I? If I don't find it, you will put me in the madhouse. Where could it be, now?
- I must look for it, mustn't I? If I don't find it, you will put me in the madhouse. Where could it be, now? Perhaps it's behind this picture.
- I must look for it, mustn't I? If I don't find it, you will put me in the madhouse. Where could it be, now? Perhaps it's behind this picture. Yes, it must be here. No. Where shall I look now?
O'MALLEY: Honestly, I'm sorry about the window.
O'MALLEY: Honestly, I'm sorry about the window. Yeah, but being sorry don't fix it.
It's all right. It's not charity. It's a loan. Thanks.
It's all right. It's not charity. It's a loan. Thanks. I can use it.
I've been to the publisher. He wasn't interested. Wouldn't even look at it. Said they were loaded up. May I see it? - So you're still in trouble.
I've been to the publisher. He wasn't interested. Wouldn't even look at it. Said they were loaded up. May I see it? - So you're still in trouble. - Wouldn't even look at it?
We love it.
Well, it's just not for me.
If I lose it, I'll swear off. I'll quit. Take 50 cents. No.
What is this? Using prohibited aids, Mr Widgren?
What is this? Using prohibited aids, Mr Widgren? I forgot to erase it. "Forgot to erase it"... But of course...
Do you see that star? It seems to be hanging far below the sky on an invisible string.
But he doesn't know it.
- After that I... - You "ate a lonely dinner," "then got into the tub to read." Why did you write it down?
- After that I... - You "ate a lonely dinner," "then got into the tub to read." Why did you write it down? Afraid you'd forget it? I am the most widely misquoted man in America. When my friends do it, I resent it.
You know how it is, Lieutenant.
Laura, take a look at this. Do you like it? Do you think it'll make people want to bathe more often? It should.
I believe you presented him with a cigarette case on his last birthday. Rather valuable, isn't it? Where did you get it?
You took a bottle of Black Pony to her house Friday night. I took it there over a week ago.
- Because it was broken. - Not when I tried it.
Then Waldo came back and placed the gun in that clock. I knew it.
Mrs Porter lent you her coat to help keep you warm. It's a beautiful coat. - Is it real mink? - I hope so. It's lovely. I've always admired mink.
He likes you, but he hates the bracelet. You will have to get rid of it. - The bracelet? - Mm-hmm.
He likes you, but he hates the bracelet. You will have to get rid of it. - The bracelet? - Mm-hmm. I've worn it for 15 years.
He likes you, but he hates the bracelet. You will have to get rid of it. - The bracelet? - Mm-hmm. I've worn it for 15 years. It's brought me nothing but good luck.

I am surprised to see the countess engage in such a frivolous undertaking.
We have come to the last item on our agenda.
You do like that tune, don't you? Oh, I love it. It's the Notre Dame victory song.
That beautiful sirloin steak is enough for at least four people. And he's hoarding it.
That beautiful sirloin steak is enough for at least four people. And he's hoarding it. Mrs. Hawkley needs it more than that lion.
Stanley. Get the meat. - You mean, me get the meat? - Of course.
Pretend you're a lady lion. All right.
- Look, the steak. Good boy, you got it.
- Look, the steak. Good boy, you got it. How'd you get it?
This one is very dull. The shortage of steel, you know.
You seem awfully fond of that thing, Chris. I am. Knute Rockne gave it to my father.
You seem awfully fond of that thing, Chris. I am. Knute Rockne gave it to my father. Put it under the pillow till morning.
I give you my word. Will you do it?
I picked it out myself.
That's for the guest. Leave it alone. And put that down. Now look what you've done.
I find this quite painful.
No, it can't be. Yes my dear, The Creeper. I'm not going to the flat. Oh, you'll be quite safe. I have him under lock and key. Now to business. What luck? See for yourself. I stuffed it with paper to stop it from rattling.
It still doesn't answer my question. What've you been up to? A little bit of hijacking, old boy. Reach into the inside pocket of that coat that you're about to throw aside. What do you find there? Pocketbook.
Are all the objects of art in this room connected with your protective system? Well, most of them but why? This Hogarth etching for instance, - is it connected? - Most certainly.
I had it here a moment ago. Extraordinary thing.
I had it here a moment ago. Extraordinary thing. Where can it be? I lifted it. Oh, what would Holmes do? I know, reconstruct the..
That china was broken after her dead body was flung there on the floor? But why, why was it done?
Matter of fact I had thought of it myself. Oh, did you really?
He was beating it along here like a frightened rabbit when I come up from behind and made the pinch. That isn't true.
I never saw such a one for breakage. You aren't even worth half the wages you earn.
Lord Penrose. La Morte Rouge is on the telephone.
I'm a postman.
Tanner sleeps here when he's in La Morte Rouge. Spooky old place.
Tanner sleeps here when he's in La Morte Rouge. Spooky old place. Villagers call it the Wolf House.
Watson have you ever stopped to think that the science of detection is very much like stringing a hand full of beads? I can't say that I have.
He dropped it and I picked it up. You were gonna give it back to him, of course? No, I wasn't. - I don't like him. - That's a pretty good reason. Besides, I need boat fare to get out of Martinique.
- He rented my boat to fish from. - You mean he had rented it. The tickets in his wallet show he was to leave Martinique at daylight. There was no money on him or in his wallet. Only some American traveler's checks. Was that customary with him?
So it goes. - That's about as far as it goes.
- I got a refund on that ticket. Here. That's gonna help a lot.
- What is it? - Chloroform. Get over by his head. If he comes to while I'm probing... pour some of it on a hunk of cotton and give him a whiff of it.
Well, it said coffee on the bag.
Let me put it to you this way, supposing you knew the saboteur? Supposing it was your brother or someone you loved?
You're not good at it. Your records are old. Don't listen, then! You're rich now.
I think it'll be grand.
They thought I loved them, or not. But I never said it.
- Is it going well? - Yes.
- Nicky, what is it?
I don't know about such things, but I imagine it was fired from a.45 or something in that general field. - Well, give it to Mac.
Give me the police department, please.
- What about the painting? - It's gone.
Draque offered 500. Mrs. Draque got it. She got conked.
Draque offered 500. Mrs. Draque got it. She got conked. Let's see, now, who else wanted it?
That's it, isn't it? Or part of it anyway.
Cocoa? What a break.
Are you telling me that there pretty lady is a skunk?
Some friend of this belly-bustin' gunman, I take it.
Well, where is it? - Where's what? - The money. Stop stalling.
Before this, we could have proved there was a mistake.
Try any monkey business and I'll blow you clear outta this house. Where's that money?
I'm gonna make you ask about it. All right.
It's a cold from beyond the grave. What are you talking about?
Believe it or not, this house is haunted. - I don't believe it.
Doctor, I'd hoped you'd be able to explain to me a happening which, to put it mildly, has always puzzled me. I shall try.
I remember the date, because it was Peter's birthday. 'You know how difficult it is, choosing presents for a man. 'They always seem to have everything they want.' - Oh, hello, darling. - Hello, sweet.
I remember the date, because it was Peter's birthday. 'You know how difficult it is, choosing presents for a man. 'They always seem to have everything they want.' - Oh, hello, darling. - Hello, sweet. Take it through, will you? - What on earth's that? - Just a little birthday present.
- I told you it sounded silly.
The only thing to do is to try not to look in it at all.
I hope your husband was satisfied with it. Yes, very. - How odd you should mention it.
The witness I couldn't supply you with.
Ah, love! It cheers the heart. - Same old story? - Same old story!
No, really, a small room is fine. What a shame!
How did you get that cut? I bumped into a man carrying some baskets a little while ago.
Where could I have got this? - I'll throw it away. - No.
Well, then you could... bring it over after a while. But I think it'd be awfully late, Netta.
Well, then you could... bring it over after a while. But I think it'd be awfully late, Netta. It wouldn't matter how late, George. - Who is it? - It's I, George.
Well, then you could... bring it over after a while. But I think it'd be awfully late, Netta. It wouldn't matter how late, George. - Who is it? - It's I, George. I've just finished it.
Well, then you could... bring it over after a while. But I think it'd be awfully late, Netta. It wouldn't matter how late, George. - Who is it? - It's I, George. I've just finished it. You said to bring it over.
it's awfully late, George.
it's awfully late, George. But you said it didn't matter how late. Well, darling, I've just been asleep. I'll just look at it.
it's awfully late, George. But you said it didn't matter how late. Well, darling, I've just been asleep. I'll just look at it. But I've... I've worked awfully hard to finish it.
Blimey, but it's hot. I'm watching out for a load of gas pipe.
That's what caused the bruise.
That's what caused the bruise. It acted like a thuggee cord. Thuggee? What's that?
That's what caused the bruise. It acted like a thuggee cord. Thuggee? What's that? It's a method of very swift and silent murder. - But what could...
I won't do it. But I must have it, dear. - I open next week.
Darling, it would be for my song! You can't have it.
Darling, it would be for my song! You can't have it. It belongs to the concerto. Oh, George.
Darling, it would be for my song! You can't have it. It belongs to the concerto. Oh, George. It's such a little thing.
Play it once. Waltz tempo. Go on.
This is our moment For gay love
- I'd forgotten it was Guy Fawkes Day.
Netta... it's not true, is it? Why haven't you told me about it before? - I tried to, George. - My dear fellow...
Mrs. Monteith had no opportunity to deliver the envelope. Yes of course, quite obvious. Where'd you find it?
It's such a dreary place.
You know this rather reminds me of a very similar account when I brought about the undoing of the notorious Professor Moriarty.
No word or picture could then make public the crucial war service of the FBI.
This stuff is fugitive.
It'll take time. Orders are not to be questioned.
Now let's get back to this envelope. Where did you take it? I was told to take it to a house on 92nd Street. -And who told you to take it there? -I don't know.
That's the one that was used to copy the data. Then Roper is the man who's been getting it out. -Shall we pick him up?
LANGE: Are you looking for a particular book? Yes, but I can't find it.
Stay there while he puts it into code. Make sure that he sends it... ... becauseeverything depends on you getting that through. -He'll send it.
On second thought, it won't be flattery.
Mrs. Robie told Emily to leave you a tray. Good.
It's tricky shooting. They're sort of scary, but they're so big and clumsy, they hate to take wing.
What have you done with Father's lab?
If you were having the baby, you'd love it.
Well, we couldn't save the child.
Is it getting lighter? Is it getting darker?
That's a terrifying problem.
Find my coat.
You had another bottle. You know you did. Where did you put it? You're not crazy. Where did you put it?
- I don't want it.
That's bunk.
I knew there was a core of something. Well, there is.
Give it to me! All right. Now, go. No fuss, please. And don't call the neighbors.
Tell it all: "To whom it may concern."
How does that little tune go? Let me see, I'll think of it in a minute. Incorrigible.
Did any of you ever hear of the Giant Rat of Sumatra? No, but it sounds terribly gruesome.
To play Remick numbers, not your own. Do you mind? No, we don't want to publish it!
Do you know it?
A diminished ninth, too. Little unusual for popular music, isn't it? Oh, I guess it is, Mr. Dreyfus,
Let's go down on the stage and run it through.
Play Embraceable You.
Please go on with your painting. All right.
Came up like an elevator. Now he's looking for new buttons to push. Seems to have an idea that happiness is vertical And the last stop is heaven. Quit it, will you, Max? I thought you'd finished your portrait.
What did the critics say? Some of them said it wasn't opera.
What did the critics say? Some of them said it wasn't opera. Why wasn't it opera? Just because ordinary people liked it?
Yeah, and he's making a tramp out of you. You wouldn't know love if it hit you in the face!
Didn't you... didn't you like the radio?
I'll pick it out myself. Well, don't break the bank! Hello, Lazy Legs. I thought I heard the doorbell. I didn't hear anything. Say, is this all you've got?
- Don't forget the money!
His money isn't phony, is it? He could borrow dough, or have it stashed away...
His money isn't phony, is it? He could borrow dough, or have it stashed away... - Or even steal it. - Chris steal? Jeepers, Johnny, he's not the type. He wouldn't have nerve enough to steal!
2000 dollars... on your life. Adele collected it.
2000 dollars... on your life. Adele collected it. It's really yours, isn't it?
2000 dollars... on your life. Adele collected it. It's really yours, isn't it? She keeps it right in her bedroom.
2000 dollars... on your life. Adele collected it. It's really yours, isn't it? She keeps it right in her bedroom. Now I wouldn't touch a penny of it, Mr. Higgins, but... if you took it, it would be perfectly legal.
Your goose is cooked, isn't it? Yes, but...
Here's 140 dollars that was taken out of her pocketbook. That was mine.
This belongs to you too, huh? It's got your fingerprints on it.
But it doesn't happen like that, in a day. It happens in a moment sometimes.
It was like lightning striking. It strikes rarely. I don't understand how it happened. - What is it?
What it is, we'll figure out later. There's a lot more to it. Go on and try to recall the details. The more cockeyed, the better for the scientific side of it.
We can call a travel agency and check all the resort names. It wasn't Angel Valley. I remember it.
What is this, shrapnel? Where did you get it? Cavite.
Well, this is really goodbye, then. It's been awfully nice, hasn't it?
You'll find it.
It's beautiful.
Well, that's fine. You overdid it again, as you say, didn't you?
Say, look, I usually charge for unpleasant work like this. - Oh, I get it, I get it.
Well, that's also unfortunate. I wanted a couple. Something in the nature of superior caretakers for this place which I intend to offer for sale furnished as it is. I'm sure I could show it off to the best possible advantage, ma'am.
It is stupid of me.
It is stupid of me. It is selfish.
Don't think I didn't think of that. How's it feel?
Don't think I didn't think of that. How's it feel? - How's it feel? - Feels fine.
Don't think I didn't think of that. How's it feel? - How's it feel? - Feels fine. How's it look?
Let's try the oxygen valve. Doorbell. - Anna's gone out.
Does it really happen to you often? Well, not anymore so than is good for me.
Oh, this is a little invention of mine. Hello, Diz.
Oh, what's wrong with it? It's open.
Oh, what's wrong with it? It's open. Why shouldn't it be open?
It's restful here. It's peaceful.
It's so pleasant here in the garden. Just step up here onto the terrace.
It'll be over, Pina, and spring will come back, and it'll be even more beautiful because we'll be free. We have to believe in it.
This one here. I applied it to relieve the pain. - And it still hurts? - Not for some time. But to be sure, you always carry it.
This one here. I applied it to relieve the pain. - And it still hurts? - Not for some time. But to be sure, you always carry it. I wanted to return it to the dentist. That explains it.
- Well, what is his connection with the bomb depot?
There are men far more monstrous than you, though they conceal it well. Besides being hideous, i'm not quick-witted.
Do you see that pavilion? It's called diana's pavilion.
It's belle! - Belle? Impossible.
Alex, I implore you, don't take it like this. But I can't help it. How else could I say it?
- Yes, I was surprised to hear you did it.
You were scared too. I saw it when you came in. But I've been playing it all the afternoon. I have it. It's so wonderful. What a creation. It's something I never hoped for or dreamed of.
The following is transcribed. Remember, folks, when you spell Drawrof backwards, it reads forward.
- He's gonna take it away. - I can't believe it.
Oh, it's nothing. Nothing at all. It's finished and done with.
It's broken. He broke it. He shouldn't have done it.
Frankie Olins had it.
Frankie Olins had it. He took it from a shiny red bank truck two days before Christmas. $400,000.
I remember every little thing about it.
No, not like that. How many times do I have to tell you?
Lloyd, here, I found it! I found it, Lloyd! Come on!
Lloyd, here, I found it! I found it, Lloyd! Come on! Come and dig it!
Lloyd, here, I found it! I found it, Lloyd! Come on! Come and dig it! Come and dig for it! Dig!

Lloyd, here, I found it! I found it, Lloyd! Come on! Come and dig it! Come and dig for it! Dig! There it is, in the ground. It's right there beneath you, Lloyd. In the ground. All our hopes, all our plans, they're all right there beneath you! Quickly, Lloyd, quickly. Dig for it! Deeper! Faster! Quickly, Lloyd! They killed for it! They all killed for it! Frankie, Vincent, I killed for it! And you, you too, you killed for it! Get off! Get off it!

The price has nothing to do with it.
Proof, my dear fellow, we must have proof.
What's it mean, Holmes? You on to something? Perhaps. I don't know yet.
And this gang has the first and third parts of it. - Precisely.
- You did. Don't make it again.
I'd love it. - But the young man...
Perhaps you shouldn't have opened the window. Close it.
- Tom, this is the Hotel Centenario. - I was told it's a good hotel.
I never saw it before. Of course you never.
- Who is it? - Bank examiner. - Bank examiner? I should have called him yesterday.
It sounded like you said "no charge." That's right. Well, what's my name doing on it? A little present from old man Gower.
There's the kitty, Ernie.
This is a pickle, George. This is a pickle. All right, now, what happened?
Well, you're gonna miss this one. If you close your doors before 6:00 p.m., you will never reopen. George, was it a nice wedding? Gosh, I wanted to be there. Yeah. You can take this one off now.
Do you realize what this means?
The Merry Christmas wreath for the window. No. I left it at the office.
Name of Lunn, somethin' like that. Said he died. Thought the room might still be empty. It still is empty.
Nick, why don't you let me take your car, I'll run that sign into town and get it fixed. Okay.
Right then, I should have walked out of that place but I couldn't make myself do it.
- Or had you started to think about it? - I didn't really mean it.
Nick, don't sell the place! I'm telling you, don't sell it! Well, I'm... I'm going to sell it. I'm superstitious. I... Never turn down a good offer.
We gotta mess ourselves up to prove we've been in the accident too. - Right. - Come on.
We gotta mess ourselves up to prove we've been in the accident too. - Right. - Come on. It's hardly smashed up at all.
However, now that you've got it off your chest... - Kennedy. MAN: Yes, sir? That confession Mrs. Smith signed, what did you do with it?
Then maybe God will forgive us and maybe it'll help square us. Maybe it will.
I wouldn't if I could help it.
- Do you think it's true? - Yes.
- I saw the most divine wedding dress at Molyneux's.
- I know, I saw it. Did you?
- I know, I saw it. Did you? Did I show it? Only to me, I think.
I have a card here of one of the best restaurants in Toulon.
It's too bad this should have happened just now.
Say it's true.
- What time's it open? How do I know?
How's a thing like that happen? Well, it's a long story. Don't ask for details, but here's most of it.
And here was this big chunk of dough floating'around loose in this country... like a pair of dice at a firemen's ball. It moved east to west.
And here was this big chunk of dough floating'around loose in this country... like a pair of dice at a firemen's ball. It moved east to west. Each time it moved, it left a stiff behind it with his fingers stretched out. The boys play rough for that kind of lettuce, you understand.
- I don't get it. - From whom was the note?
It won't make any difference to me. Maybe it will.
Her name is Elizabeth.
Conroy, the other night, a couple of nights ago, maybe... a man was murdered on the dock. - You saw it. - Yes. I saw it.
Conroy, the other night, a couple of nights ago, maybe... a man was murdered on the dock. - You saw it. - Yes. I saw it. Do you remember who did it?
I'm Larry Cravat. You can take my word for it. - I do.
- She goes too. - You won't get the money! Yes, I will.
- She goes too. - You won't get the money! Yes, I will. I know where it is now.
What does the law say about this kind of murder? is it the same as killing a man?
Listen. it's striking. After 100 years.
- Mr Potter asked me to deliver this. - Good. Sara's waiting for it.
Was the key ever out of your possession? It never is, sir.
I'd take you and charge this very moment. I didn't do it sir.
You are lucky. You get the cell with the gramophone. It belonged to barry, Him who chopped off his uncle's head. Oh.
5 ago. It's broke, the record, in the middle. It won't go any further. It keeps playing the same thing over and over again. Please don't do that. You know, it gets on the prisoners' nerves. I imagine it would. It's very simple. I'll show you.
I must have it! Make her give it to me, Mr. West. Make her give it to me now! Or it will be too late!
It's a 500? Yes, I just sold it.
It's a 500? Yes, I just sold it. It's a great machine.
Is this one any good? I don't know. Take it.
Is this one any good? I don't know. Take it. It helps me pass the time. I don't want to take it out now.
Block it. Say you lost it. Then no one else can use it.
It can be done. It's been done before, and it'll be done again.
Here, put it on. It's beautiful.
The Krauts turned all their guns to stop us. That was exactly when the other gang attacked from behind.
It's a million-to-one. He's trying to ram the gates!
That word sets your imagination on fire, doesn't it? Well, why not?
And, uh, here. - This'll fetch you a new dress. But it's gold.
- Take the ring back. - Oh, no, no. - Take it back! - No. Keep it till tomorrow.
This has been filed. The Indians have no steel.
Had I removed the iron too soon, the wound would not have seared.
Sir, this is not an attack. It's a peaceful mission.
Sir, this is not an attack. It's a peaceful mission. - How do you know, de Vargas? Maybe it's a trick.
- I can't travel with this face. It's plastered all over the papers.
A girl named Irene Jansen gave it to me.
- Have you got the money? - Yeah, you want it now? Sam said you could afford $200.
I've got a fine anesthetic. Used it in the last war.
I know it's awfully early... but you said you wanted to get away before it got light. How does your face feel?
Don't let it give you any ideas. - What kind? - Don't change yours.
If you want to walk away from here, tell me if it's the same car I think it was. I haven't got a thing to lose. Not a thing.
That's just the way you figure it. That's why you're after a confession, isn't it?
I was up for the Navy cross.
- I was wondering if you'd mind talking about it. - Not at all. Not at all.
Better you put that coat on, liebling. Coat? Thank you, I'm not cold.
How did you find out about me and the escape and the rest of it?
And if they searched me, would they ever suspect this, uh... piece of money? - Let me keep it.
It's early morning, it's cold, and we're reaching a decision. And it all seems as if it were meant to be so.
Then perhaps it was a happy day, if a bit different. No! Don't scratch it out.
You see, Angela, a concert tour is as much work as Papa's job in the museum, isn't it? It's not a pleasure trip. Quite the contrary. And this time it'll be a hard-fought battle.
Everyone knows it's been signed over to me.
A problem with the engine? - No. No water. - Is that dangerous?
That'll be the station. Oh yes, of course. Perhaps I can get a train here to Well? I can't keep it in my head. Illingenworth!
That'll be the station. Oh yes, of course. Perhaps I can get a train here to Well? I can't keep it in my head. Illingenworth! May I write it down?
I interviewed him for my paper, The Real France. Have you heard of it? I published it in November 1940. Yes. 1940... That took some courage back then, to risk yourself in such an adventure.
It's perfectly safe tonight. Should have been left where it was.
Peter, don't pull the cat's tail. You have a cruel streak. Where do you get it? I'm only playing with him.
Then this happens and you want to believe all over again. This is a ruthless world and one must be ruthless to cope with it. That isn't true.
I'm worried about the deed to this house. I want it back in my name. - Why, of course. - We can go to the lawyer's now. - Today?
I've heard it runs into a million or more acres. I've never counted them.
And I may be wrong but I've got a hunch That he wants me to help him keep it that way.
And I may be wrong but I've got a hunch That he wants me to help him keep it that way. I know it's too soon to expect you to see it that way, lutie
And I may be wrong but I've got a hunch That he wants me to help him keep it that way. I know it's too soon to expect you to see it that way, lutie But you will see it some day.
Well, this is the place for it. Hardly a woman'country. It could be.
Of talking about this country. You really think it's more important
But that out there does... And men like chamberlain, they want to farm it. They want to dig it up and draw the water out of its veins, Let the sun get at it, way down deep. It would curl up and die then, lutie, It would be dead, and so would the whole country, It would never live again.
I haven't gotten to it yet. But, I do know that...
It's an oldie. A very old oldie.
Callahan, that ain't an anchor out of the water. It's a dinghy. How did that dinghy get there? Not very neat of the inspector, was it? What's the excitement, boy?
Callahan, that ain't an anchor out of the water. It's a dinghy. How did that dinghy get there? Not very neat of the inspector, was it? What's the excitement, boy? It's just a razorblade. Oh, no.

Well, I... I don't see it on you. Of course you don't. Though it's not very far from you. Well... Well, let me guess where it's hidden. Is it in your bag? It's much nearer to me than that.
Well, I... I don't see it on you. Of course you don't. Though it's not very far from you. Well... Well, let me guess where it's hidden. Is it in your bag? It's much nearer to me than that. Is it in your bodice? I know.
Well, I... I don't see it on you. Of course you don't. Though it's not very far from you. Well... Well, let me guess where it's hidden. Is it in your bag? It's much nearer to me than that. Is it in your bodice? I know. It's hidden in the folds of your gown. - Oh, milord.
Well, I... I don't see it on you. Of course you don't. Though it's not very far from you. Well... Well, let me guess where it's hidden. Is it in your bag? It's much nearer to me than that. Is it in your bodice? I know. It's hidden in the folds of your gown. - Oh, milord. - ls it...? Is it very close to your fair white skin?
If you think of it, bring some cheese. You must come over.
Take a spoon of bicarbonate soda and water. - Yes, sir. Any answer to that message? - No. - Don't send it. This is the last straw! Where's my Stradivarius? - Here. I'll show them they can't fiddle with old Firefly. Look at 'em run! Now we're at war! - Your Excellency! They're fleeing like rats! - But sir... I'll give myself the Firefly medal. You're shooting your own men. - What? You're shooting your own men. Here's 5 dollars. Keep it under your hat.
How can l have it sent? I'll get it dropped over tomorrow. Are you staying a bit? Yes.
- I never heard of it. You wouldn't, Kemp. It's never used now. I didn't know it was even made. It's a drug that's made from a flower that's grown in India. It draws colour from everything it touches. Years ago they tried it for bleaching cloth.
- I know, but it does something else.
- I know, but it does something else. It was tried out on some poor animal - a dog, I believe. It was injected under the skin, and it turned the dog dead white, like a marble statue. - Is that so?
Where's the owner of the bicycle? Here, sir. It was pulled clean out of me hands, sir.
- It was Kemp. It was about Jack.
- It was Kemp. It was about Jack. I know it.
I tell you, there's something on that island that no white man has ever seen. - And you expect to photograph it?
I tell you, there's something on that island that no white man has ever seen. - And you expect to photograph it? - If it's there, you bet I'll photograph it.
It might almost be Egyptian. But what's on the other side of that wall? Who do you suppose could have built it? Oh, I was up on Angkor once.
You understand I admire your country. It's rugged and strong and impressive.
Was this what you brought me down here for?
In the lodge. Fire?
- Why, that's not real fruit! It's imitation! It's made of wax! What has he been doing now? He's been eating that phoney fruit.
I'll bet you can't guess who this is! Alright, who is it? It's your little brother Charlie. Well, for goodness' sake!
They are probably asleep and didn't hear it. We sure were lucky. Do be careful.
It's ridiculous! - It's absurd! - It's the silliest thing I've ever heard. Well, it certainly is.
All you have to do is press the button in the back And it walks out by itself. Isn't it wonderful?
What is it? - I couldn't tell you.
I don't know where it is. And, now ladies and gentlemen, as I was telling... Said...
A gunna gunna A great ahorta
Look at the measurements. Look at that. Look at that. That's the androgynous type.
Have a nice piece of juicy steak.
I got all your copy.
- What time is it? - 8:00. Here. It's a toothbrush, thanks.
- What time is it? - 8:00. Here. It's a toothbrush, thanks. My dress, you had it pressed. Come on. Breakfast will be ready soon. You sweet thing.
- You think it's simple? - No.
I guess that was his only interest in me, wasn't it? - The reward. - I'm sorry you read it. - Are you going to see him? - I suppose so. Certainly.
- What is it? When a woman... You'd know if...
Here, take this. Take it! - Listen...
It's missing a stamp. It's management's fault.
You can fix it, can't you? No.
So this is your car? Okay.
So this is your car? Okay. But from now on, it's mine. Get it?
Green Studebaker, at the Longchamp Hermitage. License plate number... 98 82 RG5. ...82 RG5. Let's get to work!
Green Studebaker, at the Longchamp Hermitage. License plate number... 98 82 RG5. ...82 RG5. Let's get to work! It's a green Studebaker, at the Hermitage. The license plate number is 98 82 RG5.
It won't wait for you! Take that.
It won't wait for you! Take that. It's a green Studebaker-- 98 92--
Oh yeah... this is not a tea room. It's no tennis club either.
In any case, you'll take that car to Marseilles. And quick.
Did you find it at an antique store? It was parked at the university.
It's disloyal to my future husband. Disloyal?
This is his luggage, but I think he's in his cabin.
Throw it down to me, Cheetah. Can't you see I've got nothing on.
Would you feel better if we didn't take the ivory? If we carried it back? Martin, that's sweet of you... but nothing matters anymore.
Pick up that ivory.
That's another one I can't answer now.
I'm glad you're not on this case. On it?
- I was hoping you'd find out who did it. - Maybe I will. - If Wynant...
Lets his lawyer give her money to give to him so she'll think it's blown over.
Lets his lawyer give her money to give to him so she'll think it's blown over. Then when she isn't expecting it, he lets her have it. - No proof? - Nothing as yet to cinch it.
From now on, I'm just out for the ride. I took it from her hand.
It bothered him.
Nick, are you sure one of these people is the killer? Positive. Nick, I can't stand the suspense.
What is it? Just this. Clyde Wynant did not kill Julia. He didn't kill Nunheim or anyone. What are you talking about?
I've been cursed for delving into the mysteries of life. Perhaps death is sacred, and I've profaned it.
It's beating perfectly. Just as in life.
It's beating perfectly. Just as in life. - Oh, if only I can keep it going until...
It's beating perfectly. Just as in life. - Oh, if only I can keep it going until... - It was a very fresh one.
It might have cost you your life. It was fortunate for you that I was here to save you.
Tonight will be a fine night, judging by the sky. There you are, Pitt.
She swore she won't do it again. You won't do it again?
Mr. Byam, look at this bit of meat, sir. It's alive.
It's the ship that's real.
Wonder if that's Defoe Island.
- Did you see me use it? - By no means, lad. Address your replies to the court. Milord, he didn't use the bayonet.
What are you doing in my costume?
Go ahead and read it. - What does it say?
Go ahead and read it. - What does it say? - Go on and read it.
Go ahead and read it. - What does it say? - Go on and read it. - You read it.
Sounds a little better this time. It grows on you.
I have a joint account with my husband and I'd Iike to fix it that nobody can draw the money out but me.
Get off my train!
Now, that's... Let's get inside.
Even if I call, pay no attention to it. Keep that door locked till dawn. Good night.
Even if I call, pay no attention to it. Keep that door locked till dawn. Good night. There it is, Paul. You can just see it through the trees. Dear old Falden.
So you've seen this monster before? Yes.
So you've seen this monster before? Yes. There was something grotesquely familiar about it. Then it suddenly struck me.
I know I had it. Don't worry, darling.
Where'll I put this ice? - Lay it down and don't bother me.
Give it to me. Yes. All right. We'll come. Nickie, I'm sorry.
- What is it, Henry? The telephone?
- All right, I'll give you the money. Tonight?
Selma does decide to get a divorce, how do I know you won't fight it?
- I guess it was me. Did you get him?
- Yes, I mean it. - Of course you're right.
- Yes, I mean it. - Of course you're right. She didn't do it.
- I took this picture. I found it in Pedro's apartment.
I still say, so what's it to me? Just a minute, Lieutenant.
Ask him why he threw your gun away, Selma. He knew that it hadn't been fired. You'd only have to show it to prove your innocence. Yet he threw it away. Ask him why.
You ran a nail through it! Let me hear you sing that again.
I suspected you had a plan. If Colonel Campbell accepts our terms and he would be exceedingly unwise not to it would be very simple.
And I want this necklace.
Dr. Pauquet, I can show you my books.
There's something wrong with my car. I wonder if you can help me.
Don't you like it? Of course.
Don't you like it? Of course. But do you think it goes with those trousers?
I told you how charming and how lovely you were and I'd still repeat it, but I didn't do anything. But you intended to. I did not. You had it in your eye.
It's in the inside pocket of your coat and it isn't chicken anymore.
You know, that's marvellous. I can scarcely believe it. But you're right. It is in my inside pocket.
You see, the necklace that you sold mademoiselle is really very beautiful but too expensive for us, and I'm afraid we'll have to return it.
You see, the necklace that you sold mademoiselle is really very beautiful but too expensive for us, and I'm afraid we'll have to return it. - You have it with you, dear? - Yes, darling.
You see, the necklace that you sold mademoiselle is really very beautiful but too expensive for us, and I'm afraid we'll have to return it. - You have it with you, dear? - Yes, darling. Would it upset you too much if I would ask you to take it back?
Hurry, it's almost daylight.
This story is on every wire in the world right now. Yeah, yeah. Now he's innocent. Yeah.
But I can't do it myself. You'll have to do it for me. You see that? I tore it out of a law book.
But I can't do it myself. You'll have to do it for me. You see that? I tore it out of a law book. My husband says it would be a blessing if the community would forget what happened.
I now draw your attention to this ring.
The shortest road to the village is over the moor.
- You admit it, and you fired him.
- I'm taking your arm. Yes.
- What is it? - Read it. - What does it say?
Give the gentleman a cigar. I don't quite seem to get it. It's your wrist, sir.
Bill, what is it? What is it?
I don't believe it. I won't. Now, Connie, please.
What about this? - It's nothing, Bill. - Yes, what about this? I can explain that thing.
I asked him what he was going to do with the money. Know what he said?
You see, Mr Deeds, the opera is not conducted for profit. - It isn't? What is it conducted for?
- To most people it's an awful let-down. Huh?
- What do you know about that! It's a beautiful little town, too. Grove poplar trees right along main street.
I've been workin' on a poem. It's about you. Sometimes it's kind of hard for me to say things, so I write 'em. I'd like to read it sometime.
- That goo that tastes like soap. Yes, sir.
- Don't come and ask any of it back. You listen to this - when we make an agreement, it is an agreement.
See? See the pretty feather? Sure. Sure.
Bill! Bill, you got my picture. You kept it.
Let's try it again from the beginning. - I'm getting it, aren't I? - Yes.
I'm anxious for Mr. Gordon to see this. It's an interesting experiment. How did you say that last step went?
It's quite an experience. It's more than an experience.
And if you succeed in bringing this good news to your cousin you hope to profit to some extent. Well, I've staked every penny I've got on it.
My assistant, Bailey, had his appendix out last night.
That evidence is going to hang you, Lewis. Unless it was self-defence.
And bring this book as a present.
- You mean, you'll give me the money?
Isn't it the most beautiful day? Is it so beautiful?
Let it stand. - You'll lose it all.
I'll tell you. Because your heart is a thing that can be bought and sold.
But bear witness, I owe her nothing.
But bear witness, I owe her nothing. Take it.
What a lovely song.
What a lovely song. What's the name of it? It has no name.
- Was it so important? - I didn't open it, it was for you.
That's nice.
The beginning is so beautiful, I wonder if the end matters. It's an old tune, but it's still good.
- It was glorious, wasn't it? - And what a hotel.
- It was glorious, wasn't it? - And what a hotel. - Let's forget it. Oh! Oh, no.
It's only one act, but it has everything. Love, jealousy, hate, murder, and all in 35 minutes.
It's an unusual story. I shouldn't mind reading it in a novel.
It may be more than love, or less than love. Well, man, make up your mind. What is it?
It may be more than love, or less than love. Well, man, make up your mind. What is it? It's...
I won't play it. I shall never play it.
- I've changed my mind. Oh, I thought it was only a sub-committee meeting.
Sounds like a description of you. It does, doesn't it? It annoyed me that there should be another woman who looks exactly like me.
I was just trying to make it easier for you, that's all. Did you have to throw that gadget away?
Because I would not be who I am today were it not for you. - I will never forget that.
Because I would not be who I am today were it not for you. - I will never forget that. - I did it for my country. Besides...
Who are you calling a sissy? I'll take care of it. Did you say I was a sissy? I said some people might think eating off of trays was sissy. Well, let's get something to eat anyway, huh, Harvey?
Who are you calling a sissy? I'll take care of it. Did you say I was a sissy? I said some people might think eating off of trays was sissy. Well, let's get something to eat anyway, huh, Harvey? You heard me order it. Go ahead, Charles.
This isn't the way my Treasure Island looks. It's the very first way anybody ever saw Treasure Island. Gee, it's very valuable, huh? Sure.
I don't know what to do with this. He gave it to me.
- I had no idea it was from you. - You kept it, though.
Yes, it was.
- Yes, he practically owns it.
I wouldn't go out in it for anything. By golly, that's smart kid.
We have good times together, eh, little fish? We laugh, we sing, so you smile now. Come on, smile.
Isn't that awfully large for a pill?
I've got it someplace. I know it's someplace. Here.
It's rather a strange-looking sight.
Dr. Hackenbush he's got apple dumpling. No apple dumpling. No, it's no apple dumpling. No. No.
If that nag slips by you, it means your job. Here. Keep me posted.
We should come up in a garden... behind those buildings... It's open country. Slow work.
I admire your care of your geranium. Not because I have turned botanist.
That's splendido, splendido, magnifico! It isn't a party.
It's awful. Please stop them.
Oh, for Pete's sake, get it off your chest. MAN 5: Yeah, loosen up, give out, will you, Nick? - All right, all right. - Come on. So you don't get indigestion. Turkey Morgan's been shooting his mouth off to get Kid Galahad into an early match. You birds said it would draw a million-dollar gate.
The more McGraw cracks him up, the better I'll like it. The old wheeze that he double-crossed you, eh?
- No, I'm sure of it.
No sense to it. What do you make of it, Bob? You must have some idea.
What reason could they have for doing a thing like that? That's what's on the other side of the hill.
We have no money as you know it.
What have my books got to do with it? I saw a man whose life was empty. "A man whose life was empty. "
A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably. With the same amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why? Maybe 'cause you've always been part of Shangri-La without knowing it. - I wonder.
- You think it's nonsense? You've been hypnotised by fanatics. I wouldn't believe it in England.
Do you believe it? Yes. I believe it.
-Not long at all. We met them here on the train. And who did you tell them you were? Spit it out!
is it him? -Obviously it is... not!
But you would have found out about it at some point, and then it wouldn't have been so easy to give it all up. Give it all up? -Of course! Or don't you understand it yet? -No, I understand everything perfectly.
Quite the contrary, we contradicted it, right Macky? We denied and repudiated.
- It's after us. - Don't let it out. Hold it shut. - Now's our chance. Get it now! - Quick! - Give it to it! Don't let it get away! Hold on there.
- It's after us. - Don't let it out. Hold it shut. - Now's our chance. Get it now! - Quick! - Give it to it! Don't let it get away! Hold on there. It's only Dopey.

What was it doin'? He says it's a, a monster asleep in our beds! - Let's attack. - While it's sleeping.
It's now or never! - Off with its head. - Break its bones. - Chop it to pieces.
It's now or never! - Off with its head. - Break its bones. - Chop it to pieces. We'll kill it dead. - Jiminy Crickets! - Gosh! - Gee! - What a monster!
It's now or never! - Off with its head. - Break its bones. - Chop it to pieces. We'll kill it dead. - Jiminy Crickets! - Gosh! - Gee! - What a monster! It covers three beds.
I... I hope you'll accept my apology. Oh, but think nothing of it. Promise me you'll think nothing of it.
Is it love? Pity? I've a faint suspicion it's more than pity. What a nest for a honeymoon.
Read this. What's this got to do with you?
Will it be necessary to postpone the execution?
Now, this forest is wide.
Does my lady find it interesting? Lady Marian? - Oh, I'm sorry.
Where was it? Oh, Bess, please tell me!
I know, but it's a nice kind of not sleeping. Yes, and it affects your appetite too. Not that I've noticed it's done that to you, except when he was waiting to be hanged.
Unfortunate that interruption in Mrs. Updyke's boudoir would have been a perfect moment for a blood pressure during the robbery.
- We never laid eyes on it, Jo. The papers carry a big story of what's missing.
This loft has been cleaned out perfectly. How about it, Rocks? You got it?
- Suppose the cops get hold of this book? - It's very unlikely.
What's it used for? Well, chiefly insomnia, in minute doses.
May I see it?
- Assume that it has happened. - Well?
I had it for you, only as I said, I didn't expect-- -I know. You said it before. -You don't have to worry about it. -I'm not worried.
You took the dough, made connections built it up. For you and me.
One night, he tried to shoot it out with the cops.
Take $ 100,000 out of my personal account and give it to him. What's up? Is he holding you? -Tell him yes. -Yes.
Why, when you can do it nice and legal? No trouble, no fuss.
It's twice as much as I got. -You wanna make something out of it? -No. No.
It's twice as much as I got. -You wanna make something out of it? -No. No. He deserves it. Why you starting trouble? You pull in your ears. What are we gonna do with it?
I know you forced Frazier to get you $ 100,000. Everybody knows it. What's the difference where the dough came from?
I know you forced Frazier to get you $ 100,000. Everybody knows it. What's the difference where the dough came from? First place, Frazier owed it to me. It's mine.
Sure. Don't you use it over here? Why, of course we do, for puddings. Oh, we use it for weddings.
So, Professor Urganzeff won't talk to a de Loiselle. Well. Yes, sir? Will you step in, please? Yes, Father? Nicole. What happened? You bought it?
- Pardon me, but does it really matter? It was a free-for-all.
That proves it's a CrowFlight. That's mine.
One of us should worry! On top of all this, we've stolen a car!
One of us should worry! On top of all this, we've stolen a car! That's all right. I'll send it back. I don't like it, anyway.
It would go something like this. I'll just prepare for it. Now, let me see.
But don't you think it's a good idea to go back? No, I think it's a good idea to continue our walk.
Someone here has the evil eye.
I swear, Sorgues said nothing.
I wrote it down on the back of an envelope for you. But it's enormous. I'm overcome.
Neddie, play it. Play it, Neddie. Johnny and I can bear it. Can't we?
The next year Mother had me and there was much joy in the land. It was a boy and the fair name of Seton would flourish.
I had it all planned. I was going to....
I had it all planned. I was going to.... Well, it was a good idea.
Then we'll drink a toast to Johnny. He needs it. Needs it? No, I'm wrong.
You wish to occupy yourself otherwise, is that it? Please don't make me feel guilty about it.
You wish to occupy yourself otherwise, is that it? Please don't make me feel guilty about it. Even if it is a fool idea that people dream about and then go flat on.
I feel alive and I love it. I feel at last something's happening to me.
- I don't think it matters a bit what I think.
And I believe that its path that is to say the course of true love, contrary to the adage, should run smooth. I am a man of 58 years and speak from a long experience and observation.
If that position at the bank is still open I'll be glad to take it. I'm still not convinced.
And does it have to be so tight here? - It binds. And the skirt...
It's no joking matter. Looks mighty serious. More cases than you hear about.
Pres is coming home. Of course. Did you know it?
Major Crandall's dead with it, for one.
Major Crandall's dead with it, for one. Ned Warrington's got it. No telling how many others.
I imagine Buck finds it so.
I just kind of found me a double-end boat. It ain't like I stealing, Miss Julie.
You win. This calls for action.
She likes you. I'm as popular as a dose of strychnine.
Heaven knows what the government will say about it. -Nothing at all.
Are you an artist? I wish I was. I love the arts.
The grocery should've been ashamed of me. Come on, it's not such a drama.
I'm thinking of it now. I'll dream of it. By noon tomorrow, I'll have found, rented or bought it all.
But laughter itself. It's an absurd, vulgar convulsion. Don't speak ill of laughter.
Here's a new one, Ed. Taste it.
Everyone's talking about it. Somebody's buying up everything here.
That's the reason I've lived in this house so many years and could never move out.
No, because eight years ago, a typewriter was delivered to the house by mistake. If it had been a plough, she'd have taken up farming, huh?
- How much is it? - Ten cents.
It's in my throat. It's fighting to get out.
It's in my throat. It's fighting to get out. I can't hold it back any longer.
- See if Rheba has enough sauerkraut. - All right. - Tell Donald to hurry. - Yes.
The idea of you engineering this thing and being caught in your own trap.
I'll get over it. "But, my darlings, I'm so lonesome for you.
- You ought to know it. - Polly Wolly Doodle? We drove you almost crazy with it once.
- You ought to know it. - Polly Wolly Doodle? We drove you almost crazy with it once. You know it, of course you do.
This little thing is one of the wonders of the ages. It's a screwdriver, a bottle opener, a cheese slicer, ice pick and vegetable parer.
You're supposed to be a very dangerous character. They told me that a man with your record would never go straight. I'm glad that you proved them wrong. Keep it up, kid.
Let's skip it, huh?
But we got it over the grapevine. A bigshot was coming up. And the screws wouldn't answer no questions. And then, after lights out... Yeah...
You mean you didn't know it? She's been making a sap out of you all this time? I didn't say nothing, Joe.
You haven't dropped in like this for a long time, Sir Ronald. I've come to consult you on a rather peculiar matter. Thank you no, no. Now just have a look at that. Doesn't it strike you that the handwriting is... Yes, yes. That's because it's written with the left hand. "Star of Delhi will never reach the Tower of London." Curious, and anonymous. And what is the Star of Delhi? Probably the largest emerald in the world, a gift to her majesty from the Maharajah of Rapur. Oh, I shouldn't worry about this, Sir Ronald.
The sap's not dry yet. That means it was torn off within the last few hours. Ah. What have you found, Holmes? It's a watch fob. Looks like a rabbit's foot. No, no, no.
- Now, Nickie, this is important. This is your responsibility.
Not much chance of fingerprints... after the dog's been playing with it for nobody knows how long. I'm apologizing.
- Well, I guess that does it. - Does what?
It'll be right up. You're telling me. Room service, please. There's a man outside, he wants to see you. I put him in the study. - I thought Mrs. Bellam might be here. - I don't know where she is. Can I do something? I just wanted someone to keep an eye on Nickie. - Let me. - That's very nice, but I... - Lois should get some sleep anyway. - Well, thank you very much.
- I'll get it. No, Mrs. Bellam, you stay here.
Look, Nickie, it's smoking. It worked. Give me that rod.
When Phil was trying to get money out of him... I found we spoke the same language. I'm not sorry for it.
Now, I take out my money. I count it. What happens? Punchy, what's the matter for you?
Here, hold that.
- How 'bout me handling it?
It's breakfast. Breakfast, huh?
You should've seen the parasol that came with it. - About the size of a pie. - Ohh! It must've been darling. Make the most of it today.
Would I go under the ground? No, there's no future in it! - Miss Frenchy, honey, you know that blue dress? Well, you can't wear it no more. It's got beer on it.
- You liked it, huh? - Yeah, it was all right!
- It's a mighty fine thing when a man realizes he's wrong... and tries to correct it in a nice way.
That's great. It will just put me in the mood.
But you mustn't drink it all at once, because it is the last. I meant it, my dear.

My mammy said when she went to heaven she wanted a red taffeta petticoat so stiff that it'd stand by itself and so rustley the Lord would say it's made of angels' wings. She won't take it from you.

At least I am not sitting on it, talking rubbish in chapel. - Look here...
What is it, Huw? I can't make sense with it.

I admired your stone door so much that I imitated it... by wedging another stone on the outside. You're sealed up, as in a grave.

He'll get over it.
You needn't get mad about it. Here. - I ain't no place to hide it. - Tom says I was to give it to you. I'd be scared to hold all that. I ain't never had no money.
I ain't gonna touch it. Keep the money or throw it away.
I couldn't stand it if you got down on me too. Is it something you done?
You mean the box can talk? Not really.
Is there any more of it? There's lots of it on the bottom. Lots of it. What do you do with it?

- Did you hurt the car much? - Oh, not the running of it. - And the horn wasn't hurt none.
- Yeah, it's brand-new. It ain't been hardly broke in yet.
This is my place, boy. Maybe I did, but I had to do it.
I wanted you to have it very much, and so I bought it for you. This couldn't be a diamond bracelet, could it?
The funny thing was that when my wife found that in my pocket she thought that I was the one who bought it for you. How could you possibly think such a thing? Because I know Martin.

This statement says the corporation's dissolved.
I'll never stand in their way. Craig's a lawyer.

One of them in particular hurt me.
The bracelet you gave me for our 5th anniversary, I lost it. I was still kidding myself. For a moment, I thought she'd tell me everything. She'd actually pawned her bracelet for money.
And they're trying it on. It's only human. They're going back tomorrow.
I can't do these baby clothes.
It's impossible. It's despicable.
It was you. Gloria, please. Gloria, open up.

How much farther is it? Don't look, just listen.
Where did you get that dress? Lisa and I bought it in New York. Outrageous. Where's the black and white foulard?
You see, it's strong and safe. It's simple and practical. It lets the light and air through and it's practically invisible from below.
My patent is basic. $99,000 is a lot of money.
He just... $700 just like that? Just like that. I mean, sex didn't even enter into it. Oh, but of course it did, darling.

It's not gonna be easy.
It's not gonna be easy. If you can't handle it, I'll have to get someone else.
I'm glad we came this way. It adds a few miles, but I've become a little sentimental. I want to take a last look at it.

There's something curious about this broadcast. He said tomorrow.
- Percentage is with the house. Pretty hard to beat. But it has been done, hasn't it? So they tell me.
-Yeah, that's what they call it. We've got a different name for it. - My uncle must have signed it. Which doesn't make it so funny. - Why not?
You're still wearing it, I see. It's becoming. You've grown into it. And what's that? - It's the coffee boiling. - Take it off.
It's a Polish dish. With an egg in it.
It's a Polish dish. With an egg in it. Don't let anybody give it to you without an egg in it. - We must have some, Miss Shelley. - Of course. As soon as I finish my course in American cooking...
With an egg in it.
What the dickens is that to you? Nothing.
Why should Dilg go to jail?
Queer, wasn't it? The way it suddenly shot up above the clouds? Another couple of feet, we'd smack right into it. - Still looks like Africa to me.
Don't you know that? Don't you feel it? If anything happened to you...
Don't you know that? Don't you feel it? If anything happened to you... You think I can do it?
Then I-Then it-it-it closed in on me like- like a blast from a furnace. Only it wasn't hot, it- it was-
Then I-Then it-it-it closed in on me like- like a blast from a furnace. Only it wasn't hot, it- it was- It was simply horrible.
Then I-Then it-it-it closed in on me like- like a blast from a furnace. Only it wasn't hot, it- it was- It was simply horrible. Kate screamed again and... then I was fighting it.
I'm sure by tomorrow the police will find out what it was. I've done it, Bob.
If you want to know more about it, there's a family history in the library. Thanks. I'll have a look at it.
- I'm not convinced it is a man. - A woman? Animal, vegetable or mineral?
That's what stops me, but what do you make of this? I found this during my first investigation at the scene of the crime. Obviously the hair of a large animal. A dog, perhaps. All right. Get the spectrum slide of wolf's hair out of my case while I mount this. That shows the spectrum analysis of wolf's hair. - And here's the one I found. - It's incredible. Well, Inspector, that blows up your spook theory. What's happened? It was sealed in this tube and vacuum.
Either you injected the cobra venom into Kate O'Malley's veins... or you deliberately withheld the information... that venom was in the system at the coroner's inquest. There was no reason for mentioning it. Had no bearing on the case. She didn't die from the venom.

There was no reason for mentioning it. Had no bearing on the case. She didn't die from the venom. - But you did inject it into her veins. - No.
For a moment I thought you were the monster. Quick.
That book telling the history of the family had a hint in it. Oh, so you were the one who stole it. Yes. Yes, I'd hoped to keep you from finding out. That their ancestors were balmy?
That book telling the history of the family had a hint in it. Oh, so you were the one who stole it. Yes. Yes, I'd hoped to keep you from finding out. That their ancestors were balmy? Well, let us say, rather, that their ancestors... handed it down from father to son throughout the ages.
Oh, don't take it wrong, Mrs. Craig. I'm just so excited.
Tess, I hope it's a boy. - Oh, you sweet...
Tess, I hope it's a boy. - Oh, you sweet... - It is a boy.
You saw it once.
We're not leaving without it. I've had experience. Hand it over. Tell you where his money is if you're so anxious.
All hands to the cargo winch! Bring your guns to starboard and hold fire.
But did that discourage them?
It's true, that beast came to hurt us. It's an innocent animal.
- That's nonsense. It's true, that beast came to hurt us. It's an innocent animal. It's Beelzebub! He should be judged. Because of him, Sisters commit mortal sins. They rightly hate him. He steals, hates us all, is a burden. But Mother St John likes him. They pet him for her, kick him behind her back. Beelzebub proudly walks around. Look in his eyes, see a path of lies and hypocrisy! Sister! A bluebird used to come here, it brought joy and sincerity. And a toad that made us feel compassionate. Mother St John's cat ate them.
I loved the world I left. You don't know how much I loved it. I ripped it from my heart to come here.
What's it called? That is called the "Dance of the Pelican" my own original creation. Now, girls, we'll try some bar exercises. Right over here.
You can take Jasper along as your croaker. Croaker?
He had some money in the bank, and he wouldn't draw it out. And you know what? He lost his job.
This is really something. All ready? Now, we'll dirty it up a little.
So the bridge is nothing.
- If he catches a fox, he'll call it an elephant. - And if I catch an elephant?
- If you see one soldier, raise your rifle like this.
- Can you make it to Navacerrada? - I can try.
When I stirred up the fire for coffee, I found it. - What? - It was under the ashes. - I thought you were guarding it. - I slept with your things! - You slept well!
You tell it to A... A entrust it to B, B confines in C...
Raise the invisible torch and pass it along... Keep it burning...
- Let's see now. ls it a tie? - l'm not telling. I'll give you a hint.
Mother, I want you to look at this. - Do you think Martha will like it? - Oh, it's beautiful.
To me it came that night... after Paul Holland had almost thrust me from the room... certainly from his life. I said I love him. Even as I said it, I knew he still loved his wife. And then, because I loved him, I felt I had to restore her to him... to make her what she'd been before... to make him happy. All that you say comes to the same thing. You are asking me to pass a sentence of life or death on my wife. Insulin shock treatment is an extreme measure, Paul... as Miss Connell pointed out when she suggested it to me, but... You admit that this is terribly dangerous. So why do you advise it? I've worked with it. I've seen cures. It's at least a hope. It's the very danger itself, Paul, that makes the cure possible. Insulin produces a state of coma. Then the patient is revived by a violent shock to the nerves. That shock can kill, but it can also cure. I don't know. It's a hard decision to make, but yours is only a technical responsibility. Technical responsibility. Real responsibility. The question is, will she live or die?
Isn't very likely, is it? I don't mean believe in it like believing in a religion.
Isn't very likely, is it? I don't mean believe in it like believing in a religion. I mean, do you believe it has power?
He's even used a copy of the Daily Planet. He never dropped it on the floor?
That money belongs to Miss Cowan. You know very well you stole it from her mother. Why, you.
No, no, no, it wouldn't be there. It's a large manuscript in a portfolio.
You don't understand, mademoiselle. It's the only copy I have. It represents two years' work. You heard what the lady said.
You don't understand, mademoiselle. It's the only copy I have. It represents two years' work. You heard what the lady said. But it was brought into this office.
It's not from an opera, Raoul. It's a lullaby. A lullaby.
Make it snappy.
Waco, get some cans and some ropes from the tank. Heads up. Here it comes.
How's it coming? Very good, Sergeant. Very nice.
How's it coming? Very good, Sergeant. Very nice. Any way to squeeze it out quicker?
How's it coming? Very good, Sergeant. Very nice. Any way to squeeze it out quicker? It takes its own time.
Let me take your place for a while. No, it isn't necessary. How's it coming?
- It is from my village. Never heard of it.
You hit it right on the nose.
I look at it this way. Because it is a 100-to-1 shot. Because there's so little chance of any of us coming out of it.
It broadens the mind. I wish you weren't so cocky about it.
There it is! Drink all you can find! Go on, take it!
There it is! Drink all you can find! Go on, take it! There it is! Roll in it! Swim in it!
Sometimes I get a tune in my head like that and pretty soon, I hear somebody else humming it too. I think tunes jump from head to head. Do you know whatit is, Uncle Charlie? Uh, no.
OK? And you tear it down here. And you tear it there. You fold it over here at the side. Fold over the other side here.
Watson, get your sedative.
Musgrave ritual, they call it.
"Who first shall find it were better dead
"Who first shall find it were better dead Who next shall find it perils his head. The last to find it defies dark powers."
"Who first shall find it were better dead Who next shall find it perils his head. The last to find it defies dark powers." "Who first shall find it were better dead. Who next shall find it perils his head.
Well, sir I memorized it. Obviously but why?
Not the room, Watson. Her mind. We must search her mind. Obviously, she took great pains to hide that paper.
I'll kiss the book on it. I've got it. She must have packed that paper under this cushion. She must have changed her mind. Obviously.
I'll kiss the book on it. I've got it. She must have packed that paper under this cushion. She must have changed her mind. Obviously. Well she could have hidden it anywhere here.
What we're looking for is underneath here that's what the ritual meant by deep down low. It's a burial crypt. Up with it. I say, there's somebody down there.
What we're looking for is underneath here that's what the ritual meant by deep down low. It's a burial crypt. Up with it. I say, there's somebody down there. Who is it?
Who is it, Holmes?
I grant you. But it wasn't easy to let you take my gun away from me without seeming to hand it to you. That's why I let you take the torch first. I knew you'd snap it off. Yes. We told you, you were taking an awful risk. Well we had to have a confession and these egomaniacs are always so much more chatty when they feel they have the upper hand. Shall we go?
I wonder why he left the grant down there where he found it.
Watson this microscope was last used for examining microfilm. I'm beginning to see the pattern.
What do you mean? They want us to believe that they found the document and therefore have no further use for Grayson. Well if that's true then we're done for.
If they have the document why they wasting time sending me this? No.
This blanket has had a most varied history. It's been on a many a sea voyage. The latest not six months ago.
Now would you just give me the address where you want it sent? Mrs. J. Wellington, Junior, Duponte Circle. Good night.
Moorish. Oh, my error.
Look at that tree. Yes, it bows in sorrow. No, in longing.
Look at that tree. Yes, it bows in sorrow. No, in longing. It grieves over us.
Isn't it lovely to think about? Yes.
Isn't it lovely to think about? Yes. It is only a dream. What does it matter?
I have wished it hundreds of times. I wished it when you were with me.
I have wished it hundreds of times. I wished it when you were with me. I wished it when you left me.
Ratty old chair, ain't it? Repulsive. Well, sir, there's nothing ratty about it. Perhaps you're right, doctor.
A registered package for Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Oh, he'll sign for it. Thank you, sir.
I really shouldn't, but I must see it. Oh, how simply breathtaking. You like it? Why I'm mad about it.
I really shouldn't, but I must see it. Oh, how simply breathtaking. You like it? Why I'm mad about it. You must let me take it back to the jeweler, have it properly marked. AS or just Andrea?
Look at that. What of it?
Yes, isn't it? I picked it up quite by accident.
Yes, isn't it? I picked it up quite by accident. Wasn't a mark on it except some negligible fingerprints that the police couldn't identify.
Keep out of this! It's between us. You got something to tell me... You're wasting your time. - You know what's going to happen to him?
How did the poison get in the wine?
I'll tell you why I called you. It's about Teddy. I've got to come over and see you right away.
I'd like to see the room.
Dear me! This will be a shock to the General. No, we must keep it a secret. A state secret? Yes, a state secret. Promise? You have the word of the President of the United States. Cross my heart and hope to die. Now, let's see.
That won't have any effect. I've tried it before--
Sometimes it goes on like that all night. - Really? - Yes. Maybe we'd better go to your house, huh? No, dear.
- What does it say? - I can't read it. I haven't got my glasses. - Here, hold this. I'll climb up and I'll see. - Never mind, I'll climb up.
Gee, that's swell. That's a wonderful machine.
- I call it the Big Noise. - Why? Because, properly detonated, it would blow up this entire city. What do you want us to do with it? I don't want you to do anything with it, except to guard it with your lives. The utmost secrecy must be observed.
- I call it the Big Noise. - Why? Because, properly detonated, it would blow up this entire city. What do you want us to do with it? I don't want you to do anything with it, except to guard it with your lives. The utmost secrecy must be observed. If the wrong people learned what I have in mind and it was discovered, it might alter the whole course of the war.
How does it fly? That's just what I'm working on. Good night. He must have given me the wrong key.
How does it fly? That's just what I'm working on. Good night. He must have given me the wrong key. - Let me try it now. Maybe I can fix it. - All right.
- I'll handle this. - Yes. Come on. That's deep enough.
It will be flown directly over this battery and you will attempt to blow it out of the sky. All right, sergeant, start the plane.
I made this myself, Mr. Cody. I hope you'll enjoy it.
What is it? What did I say to offend you?
What is it? What did I say to offend you? Please, I'd rather you kept it.
What is it? What did I say to offend you? Please, I'd rather you kept it. It was so becoming to you.
Diphtheria. What's that?
Diphtheria. What's that? It's a germ. Where does it come from? From water systems. From sewage.
Lend me your car for a while?
You said it wasn't an accident. Check.
You said it wasn't an accident. Check. You said it wasn't suicide. Check.
That perfume on your hair. What's the name of it? I don't know.
But right then it gave me a nasty feeling to be thinking about them at all... with that briefcase right behind my head that had her father's signature in it... and what that signature meant. It meant he was a dead pigeon.
Look, we're not gonna grab a hammer and do it quick, just to get it over with. - There are other ways.
We had a cabin there.
If the cocoa is not sweet enough for you... It's fine, it's fine.
With it. You pig. What will you give me for the "Mecklenburg"? Have you doubled it? But it's not genuine. Show me. On one end it goes back and forth, and on the other end it goes around. That is the connecting rod. Sometimes this kind of steam engine has two cylinders.
It was your idea.
I'll point out the window of the room in Number 9 where it happened.
With the sun rising, lighting your hair as it is now. I don't know how it ends.
That piano traveled with her everywhere in the great days.
I'm afraid the pin is not very strong. - No.
Nancy, did you turn the gas up in there? Turn it up? No, why?
Nancy, did you turn the gas up in there? Turn it up? No, why? I thought it went down in here, as if you had.
The little picture has been taken down. Who took it down? - Why has it been taken down? - Why indeed? Why was it taken down before?
The little picture has been taken down. Who took it down? - Why has it been taken down? - Why indeed? Why was it taken down before? Get it from wherever you've hidden it and put it back in its place.
Don't look at me like that.
I think it's the most...
Then it really happens. I thought I imagined it.
I know it. I know it. But he was here.
You see how it is, Elizabeth? Yes, sir.
Look, in the drawer of that cupboard there is a knife.
Would you get it, Paula?
Would you get it, Paula? Would you get it for me?
Would you get it, Paula? Would you get it for me? Yes, I'll get it.
- I must look for it, mustn't I?
- I must look for it, mustn't I? If I don't find it, you will put me in the madhouse.
- I must look for it, mustn't I? If I don't find it, you will put me in the madhouse. Where could it be, now?
- I must look for it, mustn't I? If I don't find it, you will put me in the madhouse. Where could it be, now? Perhaps it's behind this picture.
- I must look for it, mustn't I? If I don't find it, you will put me in the madhouse. Where could it be, now? Perhaps it's behind this picture. Yes, it must be here. No. Where shall I look now?
O'MALLEY: Honestly, I'm sorry about the window.
O'MALLEY: Honestly, I'm sorry about the window. Yeah, but being sorry don't fix it.
It's all right. It's not charity. It's a loan. Thanks.
It's all right. It's not charity. It's a loan. Thanks. I can use it.
I've been to the publisher. He wasn't interested. Wouldn't even look at it. Said they were loaded up. May I see it? - So you're still in trouble.
I've been to the publisher. He wasn't interested. Wouldn't even look at it. Said they were loaded up. May I see it? - So you're still in trouble. - Wouldn't even look at it?
We love it.
Well, it's just not for me.
If I lose it, I'll swear off. I'll quit. Take 50 cents. No.
What is this? Using prohibited aids, Mr Widgren?
What is this? Using prohibited aids, Mr Widgren? I forgot to erase it. "Forgot to erase it"... But of course...
Do you see that star? It seems to be hanging far below the sky on an invisible string.
But he doesn't know it.
- After that I... - You "ate a lonely dinner," "then got into the tub to read." Why did you write it down?
- After that I... - You "ate a lonely dinner," "then got into the tub to read." Why did you write it down? Afraid you'd forget it? I am the most widely misquoted man in America. When my friends do it, I resent it.
You know how it is, Lieutenant.
Laura, take a look at this. Do you like it? Do you think it'll make people want to bathe more often? It should.
I believe you presented him with a cigarette case on his last birthday. Rather valuable, isn't it? Where did you get it?
You took a bottle of Black Pony to her house Friday night. I took it there over a week ago.
- Because it was broken. - Not when I tried it.
Then Waldo came back and placed the gun in that clock. I knew it.
Mrs Porter lent you her coat to help keep you warm. It's a beautiful coat. - Is it real mink? - I hope so. It's lovely. I've always admired mink.
He likes you, but he hates the bracelet. You will have to get rid of it. - The bracelet? - Mm-hmm.
He likes you, but he hates the bracelet. You will have to get rid of it. - The bracelet? - Mm-hmm. I've worn it for 15 years.
He likes you, but he hates the bracelet. You will have to get rid of it. - The bracelet? - Mm-hmm. I've worn it for 15 years. It's brought me nothing but good luck.
He likes you, but he hates the bracelet. You will have to get rid of it. - The bracelet? - Mm-hmm. I've worn it for 15 years. It's brought me nothing but good luck. He hates it.
I am surprised to see the countess engage in such a frivolous undertaking.
We have come to the last item on our agenda.
You do like that tune, don't you? Oh, I love it. It's the Notre Dame victory song.
That beautiful sirloin steak is enough for at least four people. And he's hoarding it.
That beautiful sirloin steak is enough for at least four people. And he's hoarding it. Mrs. Hawkley needs it more than that lion.
Stanley. Get the meat. - You mean, me get the meat? - Of course.
Pretend you're a lady lion. All right.
- Look, the steak. Good boy, you got it.
- Look, the steak. Good boy, you got it. How'd you get it?
This one is very dull. The shortage of steel, you know.
You seem awfully fond of that thing, Chris. I am. Knute Rockne gave it to my father.
You seem awfully fond of that thing, Chris. I am. Knute Rockne gave it to my father. Put it under the pillow till morning.
I give you my word. Will you do it?
I picked it out myself.
That's for the guest. Leave it alone. And put that down. Now look what you've done.
I find this quite painful.
No, it can't be. Yes my dear, The Creeper. I'm not going to the flat. Oh, you'll be quite safe. I have him under lock and key. Now to business. What luck? See for yourself. I stuffed it with paper to stop it from rattling.
It still doesn't answer my question. What've you been up to? A little bit of hijacking, old boy. Reach into the inside pocket of that coat that you're about to throw aside. What do you find there? Pocketbook.
Are all the objects of art in this room connected with your protective system? Well, most of them but why? This Hogarth etching for instance, - is it connected? - Most certainly.
I had it here a moment ago. Extraordinary thing.
I had it here a moment ago. Extraordinary thing. Where can it be? I lifted it. Oh, what would Holmes do? I know, reconstruct the..
That china was broken after her dead body was flung there on the floor? But why, why was it done?
Matter of fact I had thought of it myself. Oh, did you really?
He was beating it along here like a frightened rabbit when I come up from behind and made the pinch. That isn't true.
I never saw such a one for breakage. You aren't even worth half the wages you earn.
Lord Penrose. La Morte Rouge is on the telephone.
I'm a postman.
Tanner sleeps here when he's in La Morte Rouge. Spooky old place.
Tanner sleeps here when he's in La Morte Rouge. Spooky old place. Villagers call it the Wolf House.
Watson have you ever stopped to think that the science of detection is very much like stringing a hand full of beads? I can't say that I have.
He dropped it and I picked it up. You were gonna give it back to him, of course? No, I wasn't. - I don't like him. - That's a pretty good reason. Besides, I need boat fare to get out of Martinique.
- He rented my boat to fish from. - You mean he had rented it. The tickets in his wallet show he was to leave Martinique at daylight. There was no money on him or in his wallet. Only some American traveler's checks. Was that customary with him?
So it goes. - That's about as far as it goes.
- I got a refund on that ticket. Here. That's gonna help a lot.
- What is it? - Chloroform. Get over by his head. If he comes to while I'm probing... pour some of it on a hunk of cotton and give him a whiff of it.
Well, it said coffee on the bag.
Let me put it to you this way, supposing you knew the saboteur? Supposing it was your brother or someone you loved?
You're not good at it. Your records are old. Don't listen, then! You're rich now.
I think it'll be grand.
They thought I loved them, or not. But I never said it.
- Is it going well? - Yes.
- Nicky, what is it?
I don't know about such things, but I imagine it was fired from a.45 or something in that general field. - Well, give it to Mac.
Give me the police department, please.
- What about the painting? - It's gone.
Draque offered 500. Mrs. Draque got it. She got conked.
Draque offered 500. Mrs. Draque got it. She got conked. Let's see, now, who else wanted it?
That's it, isn't it? Or part of it anyway.
Cocoa? What a break.
Are you telling me that there pretty lady is a skunk?
Some friend of this belly-bustin' gunman, I take it.
Well, where is it? - Where's what? - The money. Stop stalling.
Before this, we could have proved there was a mistake.
Try any monkey business and I'll blow you clear outta this house. Where's that money?
I'm gonna make you ask about it. All right.
It's a cold from beyond the grave. What are you talking about?
Believe it or not, this house is haunted. - I don't believe it.
Doctor, I'd hoped you'd be able to explain to me a happening which, to put it mildly, has always puzzled me. I shall try.
I remember the date, because it was Peter's birthday. 'You know how difficult it is, choosing presents for a man. 'They always seem to have everything they want.' - Oh, hello, darling. - Hello, sweet.
I remember the date, because it was Peter's birthday. 'You know how difficult it is, choosing presents for a man. 'They always seem to have everything they want.' - Oh, hello, darling. - Hello, sweet. Take it through, will you? - What on earth's that? - Just a little birthday present.
- I told you it sounded silly.
The only thing to do is to try not to look in it at all.
I hope your husband was satisfied with it. Yes, very. - How odd you should mention it.
The witness I couldn't supply you with.
Ah, love! It cheers the heart. - Same old story? - Same old story!
No, really, a small room is fine. What a shame!
How did you get that cut? I bumped into a man carrying some baskets a little while ago.
Where could I have got this? - I'll throw it away. - No.
Well, then you could... bring it over after a while. But I think it'd be awfully late, Netta.
Well, then you could... bring it over after a while. But I think it'd be awfully late, Netta. It wouldn't matter how late, George. - Who is it? - It's I, George.
Well, then you could... bring it over after a while. But I think it'd be awfully late, Netta. It wouldn't matter how late, George. - Who is it? - It's I, George. I've just finished it.
Well, then you could... bring it over after a while. But I think it'd be awfully late, Netta. It wouldn't matter how late, George. - Who is it? - It's I, George. I've just finished it. You said to bring it over.
it's awfully late, George.
it's awfully late, George. But you said it didn't matter how late. Well, darling, I've just been asleep. I'll just look at it.
it's awfully late, George. But you said it didn't matter how late. Well, darling, I've just been asleep. I'll just look at it. But I've... I've worked awfully hard to finish it.
Blimey, but it's hot. I'm watching out for a load of gas pipe.
That's what caused the bruise.
That's what caused the bruise. It acted like a thuggee cord. Thuggee? What's that?
That's what caused the bruise. It acted like a thuggee cord. Thuggee? What's that? It's a method of very swift and silent murder. - But what could...
I won't do it. But I must have it, dear. - I open next week.
Darling, it would be for my song! You can't have it.
Darling, it would be for my song! You can't have it. It belongs to the concerto. Oh, George.
Darling, it would be for my song! You can't have it. It belongs to the concerto. Oh, George. It's such a little thing.
Play it once. Waltz tempo. Go on.
This is our moment For gay love
- I'd forgotten it was Guy Fawkes Day.
Netta... it's not true, is it? Why haven't you told me about it before? - I tried to, George. - My dear fellow...
Mrs. Monteith had no opportunity to deliver the envelope. Yes of course, quite obvious. Where'd you find it?
It's such a dreary place.
You know this rather reminds me of a very similar account when I brought about the undoing of the notorious Professor Moriarty.
No word or picture could then make public the crucial war service of the FBI.
This stuff is fugitive.
It'll take time. Orders are not to be questioned.
Now let's get back to this envelope. Where did you take it? I was told to take it to a house on 92nd Street. -And who told you to take it there? -I don't know.
That's the one that was used to copy the data. Then Roper is the man who's been getting it out. -Shall we pick him up?
LANGE: Are you looking for a particular book? Yes, but I can't find it.
Stay there while he puts it into code. Make sure that he sends it... ... becauseeverything depends on you getting that through. -He'll send it.
On second thought, it won't be flattery.
Mrs. Robie told Emily to leave you a tray. Good.
It's tricky shooting. They're sort of scary, but they're so big and clumsy, they hate to take wing.
What have you done with Father's lab?
If you were having the baby, you'd love it.
Well, we couldn't save the child.
Is it getting lighter? Is it getting darker?
That's a terrifying problem.
Find my coat.
You had another bottle. You know you did. Where did you put it? You're not crazy. Where did you put it?
- I don't want it.

It is stupid of me.
It is stupid of me. It is selfish.

Do you realize what this means?
The Merry Christmas wreath for the window. No. I left it at the office.
Name of Lunn, somethin' like that. Said he died. Thought the room might still be empty. It still is empty.
Nick, why don't you let me take your car, I'll run that sign into town and get it fixed. Okay.

You see, Angela, a concert tour is as much work as Papa's job in the museum, isn't it? It's not a pleasure trip. Quite the contrary. And this time it'll be a hard-fought battle.
Everyone knows it's been signed over to me.
A problem with the engine? - No. No water. - Is that dangerous?
That'll be the station. Oh yes, of course. Perhaps I can get a train here to Well? I can't keep it in my head. Illingenworth!
That'll be the station. Oh yes, of course. Perhaps I can get a train here to Well? I can't keep it in my head. Illingenworth! May I write it down?
I interviewed him for my paper, The Real France. Have you heard of it? I published it in November 1940. Yes. 1940... That took some courage back then, to risk yourself in such an adventure.
It's perfectly safe tonight. Should have been left where it was.
Peter, don't pull the cat's tail. You have a cruel streak. Where do you get it? I'm only playing with him.
Then this happens and you want to believe all over again. This is a ruthless world and one must be ruthless to cope with it. That isn't true.
I'm worried about the deed to this house. I want it back in my name. - Why, of course. - We can go to the lawyer's now. - Today?

Well, this is the place for it. Hardly a woman'country. It could be.
Of talking about this country. You really think it's more important
But that out there does... And men like chamberlain, they want to farm it. They want to dig it up and draw the water out of its veins, Let the sun get at it, way down deep. It would curl up and die then, lutie, It would be dead, and so would the whole country, It would never live again.
I haven't gotten to it yet. But, I do know that...
It's an oldie. A very old oldie.
Callahan, that ain't an anchor out of the water. It's a dinghy. How did that dinghy get there? Not very neat of the inspector, was it? What's the excitement, boy?

It's in my data. I am Miss Frost, Congresswoman from Iowa, 9th district. Delightful of Congress to send us a lady representative for a change. Delightful. May I suggest here and now that we dispense with all the soft soap. As committee chairman, permit me to bring you greetings from the people of the United States of America.

Powdered egg omelette, probably, and a little Spam. - Can I carry that for you? - No, thank you.

We've struck it, Curt.
It's just like plain sand. It don't glitter. I thought it would. It will when it's refined by some other guy.
How much do you figure it to be now? About $5,000 worth, I reckon.
