Let's talk about it over dinner tonight. A friendly dinner. We'll talk it over.
That's a costume I could wear. It'd be a change from feathers. They always cover me in them! This is too long.
Why did you arm yourself with a knife before going to the victim's dressing room? I wasn't armed with a knife, your Honor. I had it on me when I left my dressing room.
Nothing? You return from Europe with a masterpiece worth $100,000, and instead of displaying it yourself, you let me unveil it at my party for Captain Spaulding. You call that nothing? - Mrs. Rittenhouse, I...
My friends, I'm highly gratified of this display of effusion... My friends, I'm highly gratified of this display of effusion. Hooray for Captain Spaulding...
- Most original. Be careful. Where did she get that?
Be careful. Where did she get that? Is it very valuable?
- Isn't he charming? That's the famous Beaugard, eh? Great picture, isn't it?
- Mother's going to unveil it tonight. Yeah? Suppose when she unveils it, it's not the Beaugard at all.
What's a matter? You lose it? You gotta find it.
Mr. Chandler! My friends, you are all familiar with Beaugard. This is perhaps his masterpiece.
- Good. Good heavens. It's gone. - Gone?
The painting you changed last night. You mean the piksh? - Yes.
There's the criminal. No. Beaugard is dead. Dead?
Where's the egg? It could be spinach. Look at all the sand.
Yes, disappeared. And you know what make it disappear? Moths!
Friend, how do you find that valley? Wellmore here is sending a bull train clear through to old Tom Williams's trading post. First time it's ever been tried.
Is that how it seems to you? How else can I take it? It's nothing to me how you take it.
It's nothing to me how you take it. But it matters a heap to me, ma'am, how you understand. Perhaps not.
I've never told Black Elk a lie yet. He knows my tongue is straight. Well, what do you mean?
Shank me off a snack! Get out of there. Fine piece of beef. Ah!
Well, why not? I don't mind fists or feet, or even a gun. It's the way he throws that knife.
Stop shooting', everybody! Stop shooting'! They're ridin' off.
You overplayed your hand that time, Lopez! Zeke, this is old Ben Griswell's knife. Well, where'd you find it, boy?
Zeke, this is old Ben Griswell's knife. Well, where'd you find it, boy? Lopez just left it sticking in my bedroll.
And I just recollected, I got a little present for you. Oh, Zeke, what is it? Well, a young fella named Breck Coleman left it with me, and he told me to give it to you in case he didn't show up. Where is it, Zeke?
Well, a young fella named Breck Coleman left it with me, and he told me to give it to you in case he didn't show up. Where is it, Zeke? I hid it in the holler of the big tree at the bend of the trail.
Pears he has liked. Go ahead, read on, friend! The kulak Belokon sabotages our work, hides the seeds and kills the livestock..."
Go ahead, read on, friend! The kulak Belokon sabotages our work, hides the seeds and kills the livestock..." I'm not giving it away!
Go! Go on then! Go!
Who is it from? A friend. What's it about?
A friend. What's it about? It's about me.
With me it's a closed book. Finis. Never bring up the matter again.
Finis. Never bring up the matter again. It's private.
What you got there, Joe? What are you doing with that? Can't you forget you've seen it?
This is the joint where you're working. And don't you be forgetting it, either. Come on in.
Say, there's a lonesome touring car down the street. I was wondering if you happened to know anything about it. How should I know anything about it?
- Poor kid. - Yeah, but Rico's wreath beat them all. It was big.
Now you're through. If you ain't out of town by tomorrow morning you won't ever leave it except in a pine box. I'm taking over this territory.
Boy, it sure look... Oh, look at that. - Do you like it?
No. Shoot. Shoot, Rico.
"Reinhold tried to kiss me, and I let him have it!" Let me go! You swine!
But... this little gizmo here ― this gave me the idea. They can knock it down and turn it on its head ― it always gets back on its feet. That's right.
They can knock it down and turn it on its head ― it always gets back on its feet. That's right. It has metal where it counts. Think about it, folks.
I don't use invisible ink. What do you call this masterpiece? I haven't named it yet.
It looks very inviting. Oh, it's nothing serious. Just a small cut from that paper clip.
You'll excuse me, I'm wanted on the telephone. The Abbey could be very attractive, but I should imagine it would need quite extensive repairs. I shall do very little repairing.
And when the dream came, it seemed the whole room was filled with mist. It was so thick, I could just see the lamp by the bed, a tiny spark in the fog. And then I saw two red eyes staring at me, and a white livid face came down out of the mist.
He opened a vein in his arm and he made me drink... What is it? Who is it, Martin?
Aren't you feeling well? I hope it's nothing serious. I had a terrible dream a few nights ago and I haven't been able to get it out of my mind.
And I feel terrific. But it's stuffy in here. And that smell.
Eva, my daughter! It's all right, Eva, my love. The cross.
Sit down. Go and sit down. - It understands this time.
I said beat it! He said beat it. Gee, I wish I'd said that.
Full of holes My aunt thought it would do And what do you think?
My aunt thought it would do And what do you think? That it won't do
A petticoat. I've got it on – A petticoat? She opened her cupboard and gave me a petticoat
[ Ollie ] 'A month apiece'! You can take it from me. When I get out, I'm going back on the farm. Boy, there's the life.
Don't tell me you were drunk and don't remember. - Or is it one of Bingy's snowstorms? - It's true all right.
- About the Siberian bloodhound? Siberian bloodhound? No, it's been all rewritten.
- Yes, sir. - Found no skeletons? - No, sir.
Listen, I was in a place today, and I heard somebody say something. - What of it? - Well, they were saying...
You either take their beer, or they put you on the spot. I tell you, Michael, it is a wicked business. Why, only last week...
I tell you, Michael, it is a wicked business. Why, only last week... - Got it?
You'd say what? I won't say it. Oh, Bill.
Oh, Bill. If you'd wanted something all your life and fate laid it right in your palm? What would you do?
Yeah, Billy. Here's that piece of cheese. They call it "The Stolen Jools".
Here's that piece of cheese. They call it "The Stolen Jools". Take it away before the Board of Health gets here.
- I think it is, General Shubin. - May I? - Surely.
Photographs of his dispatches to Russia. Doesn't that convince you? Yes, I'm quite convinced.
- I don't want to frighten you, but... What is it? It would be glorious to go with you but I may never be able to see all those splendid things.
I called you gordon. Why, that's a christian name, too. Yes. I liked it.
Not a bad thought, eh? What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.
Listen to this, the bank was robbed last night. Yeah, over $100,000. Who did it?
Hurry up. - Closing your account? - Yes, sir.
- You're protecting somebody. - No, I'm not. It doesn't matter who it is.
Listen. I need $1 million in cash, and I've got to have it quick. What?
I need $1 million in cash, and I've got to have it quick. What? No, tomorrow is no good. I need it now.
Quiet down. Take it easy, folks. Everything'll be all right.
Take it easy, folks. Everything'll be all right. But you said it was safe.
And then we came to a park. Only there was a tremendously large yellow moon up in the sky. It was altogether too big and too bright.
-Her sister? -l thought it was her aunt. -Maybe you are right. Maybe it was her aunt.
I have. That's your bedroom? Yes. Want to see it?
Listen, Heinrich. I've taken all my savings, everything... and I'm going to enjoy spending it. All of it. It's terribly expensive here, Heinrich.
- Yes. - What's the matter? The child has come.
I think you know what the trustees can do with their suggestions. "I don't know what they have to say, it makes no difference anyway, Whatever it is, I'm against it.
Whatever it is, I'm against it. No matter what it is and who commenced it, I'm against it. Your proposition may be good, but let's have one thing understood.
No matter what it is and who commenced it, I'm against it. Your proposition may be good, but let's have one thing understood. I'm against it!
Baravelli, who did this? Is this your picture? It doesn't look like me.
Is this your picture? It doesn't look like me. - Well, take it away and hang it in my bedroom.
Tartar war bow... That one up there. It's cute.
Come out, Rainsford. Why prolong it? I'll not bungle this shot.
It's adorable. I'll take it.
It's adorable. I'll take it. I'm glad you like it.
I'll take it. I'm glad you like it. It's the latest model.
I'll get it out. Get out of here and get that piano out of that box! - What were you doing up there?
Think I'm overjoyed about it? But it's just got to be, that's all. - Well then? - I left the boat here for the same reason I took it at Saigon. - What reason?
Say, what's this? Some new kind of an alarm clock? It doesn't seem to ring or tick at all. - Hey! It was a barometer!
There. Crude rubber. Well, I can't believe it. But how does it...
Gary... - Yes? - Maybe I... Well...maybe I'd better go.
- I want it, that's why. Give it back. It's bad money.
You just are. What else are you doing with all your money? I hear you're getting a new car.
How do you like this place? - Kind of gaudy, isn't it? - Ain't it?
Let me lie down, Tony. I'm all hollow inside. - Cesca, what is it?
I owe you my life and I wont forget it. Though, between you and me, it isnt worth much. - This is yours?
I haven't thought about it much. Will you? I thought I hated this country.
Yet, I don't know. It's part of it all. - Love it, don't you?
The description fits. That's our bag. Twenty thousand francs. If I sold it, I would get...
I was nowhere near that niche. Oh, that's strange. Maybe... Are you sure this is your bag?
- What'd you do with our money? - I got it in the saddlebag. You'd better give it to me.
We can settle down for life and live on the fat of the land. Keep your hands where they are. Hand it over.
Prudence attending, Vengeance inspires - You can remember it? - Yes, sir.
- You're not gonna forget it? - No, sir. Do you remember it?
Well, I... I don't see it on you. Of course you don't. Though it's not very far from you.
Though it's not very far from you. Well... Well, let me guess where it's hidden. Is it in your bag?
Well... Well, let me guess where it's hidden. Is it in your bag? It's much nearer to me than that.
It's much nearer to me than that. Is it in your bodice? I know.
I know. It's hidden in the folds of your gown. - Oh, milord.
It's hidden in the folds of your gown. - Oh, milord. - ls it...? Is it very close to your fair white skin?
Oh. You can come in the back way, no one'll see you. If you think of it, bring some cheese. You must come over.
You're shooting your own men. Here's 5 dollars. Keep it under your hat.
I'll get it dropped over tomorrow. Are you staying a bit? Yes.
It's a drug that's made from a flower that's grown in India. It draws colour from everything it touches. Years ago they tried it for bleaching cloth.
They gave it up because it destroyed the material. - That doesn't sound very terrible. - I know, but it does something else.
It was tried out on some poor animal - a dog, I believe. It was injected under the skin, and it turned the dog dead white, like a marble statue. - Is that so?
Where's the owner of the bicycle? Here, sir. It was pulled clean out of me hands, sir.
- Who was that, Father? - It was Kemp. It was about Jack.
- It was Kemp. It was about Jack. I know it.
Well, every legend has a basis of truth. I tell you, there's something on that island that no white man has ever seen. - And you expect to photograph it?
I tell you, there's something on that island that no white man has ever seen. - And you expect to photograph it? - If it's there, you bet I'll photograph it.
But what's on the other side of that wall? Who do you suppose could have built it? Oh, I was up on Angkor once.
Imagine, in this icecap, finding someone who knows Spain. You understand I admire your country. It's rugged and strong and impressive.
Lily. Lily. Was this what you brought me down here for?
There's a fire, milord. In the lodge. Fire?
It's made of wax! What has he been doing now? He's been eating that phoney fruit.
Alright, who is it? It's your little brother Charlie. Well, for goodness' sake!
They are probably asleep and didn't hear it. We sure were lucky. Do be careful.
- It's absurd! - It's the silliest thing I've ever heard. Well, it certainly is.
Don't try to lift it. All you have to do is press the button in the back And it walks out by itself. Isn't it wonderful?
So far, so good. What is it? - I couldn't tell you.
Oh, is she a dream and you should see that dream walking. I'm sorry. I don't know where it is. And, now ladies and gentlemen, as I was telling... Said...
What a linguist! What a linguist! By now you outta know The Baron's gonna say hello! A gunna gunna A great ahorta
Look at the measurements. Look at that. Look at that. That's the androgynous type.
Let me off this boat or I'll break every piece of furniture in here! Here, now. Have a nice piece of juicy steak.
Listen monkey face, when you fired me, you fired the best news hound your filthy scandal sheet ever had. You wouldn't know a newspaper story if it kicked you in the pants. I got all your copy.
- 8:00. Here. It's a toothbrush, thanks.
My dress, you had it pressed. Come on. Breakfast will be ready soon. You sweet thing.
There's no end to your accomplishments, is there? - You think it's simple? - No.
- Are you going to see him? - I suppose so. Certainly.
- Auntie! - What is it? When a woman... You'd know if...
Here, take this. Take it! - Listen...
There's an error on the registration form of the man they sent down below. It's missing a stamp. It's management's fault.
- Oh really? You can fix it, can't you? No.
You are a smartie. So this is your car? Okay.
Okay. But from now on, it's mine. Get it?
License plate number... 98 82 RG5. ...82 RG5. Let's get to work!
Let's get to work! It's a green Studebaker, at the Hermitage. The license plate number is 98 82 RG5.
Hurry up, for Christ's sake! It won't wait for you! Take that.
It won't wait for you! Take that. It's a green Studebaker-- 98 92--
Where were we? Oh yeah... this is not a tea room. It's no tennis club either.
He's being picky. In any case, you'll take that car to Marseilles. And quick.
He likes speed and could be careless... and push that car... a little too much. Did you find it at an antique store? It was parked at the university.
We must never do this again. It's disloyal to my future husband. Disloyal?
- Hello, Edward. Where's Mr. Arlington? This is his luggage, but I think he's in his cabin.
Cheetah, that isn't funny. Throw it down to me, Cheetah. Can't you see I've got nothing on.
Would you feel better if we didn't take the ivory? If we carried it back? Martin, that's sweet of you... but nothing matters anymore.
Cheetah can show us the way after. Come back here, you! Pick up that ivory.
Just one more question I want to ask you. Are you willing to swear to a complaint for this guy's plugging you? That's another one I can't answer now.
He's got more sense than you have. I'm glad you're not on this case. On it?
- I was hoping you'd find out who did it. - Maybe I will. - If Wynant...
Sees she's two-timing him, there's a fight. He doesn't do anything because of Morelli. Lets his lawyer give her money to give to him so she'll think it's blown over.
Then when she isn't expecting it, he lets her have it. - No proof? - Nothing as yet to cinch it.
I'm not going to get married, and I'm not having any children. From now on, I'm just out for the ride. I took it from her hand.
You won't get another swallow until you say. I happened to remember he had shrapnel in his shin. It bothered him.
Nick, are you sure one of these people is the killer? Positive. Nick, I can't stand the suspense.
Just this. Clyde Wynant did not kill Julia. He didn't kill Nunheim or anyone. What are you talking about?
But it's never out of my mind. I've been cursed for delving into the mysteries of life. Perhaps death is sacred, and I've profaned it.
A thousand crowns. It's beating perfectly. Just as in life.
It's beating perfectly. Just as in life. - Oh, if only I can keep it going until...
Just as in life. - Oh, if only I can keep it going until... - It was a very fresh one.
You're extremely foolish. It might have cost you your life. It was fortunate for you that I was here to save you.
What the devil have you been up to? Tonight will be a fine night, judging by the sky. There you are, Pitt.
Isn't she lovely! She swore she won't do it again. You won't do it again?
Dive in with your mess, lads. The boats are alongside. Mr. Byam, look at this bit of meat, sir. It's alive.
But it's a dream, Fletcher. This island isn't real for you and me. It's the ship that's real.
A kind word would do more with seamen than the cat-o'-nine-tails. And this ship will be the worse if possible, for his death. Wonder if that's Defoe Island.
- Did you see me use it? - By no means, lad. Address your replies to the court. Milord, he didn't use the bayonet.
Listen, Gottlieb, nix on the lovemaking, because I saw Mrs. Claypool first. Of course, her mother really saw her first, but why bring the Civil War into this? What are you doing in my costume?
I haven't been in Canada in years. Go ahead and read it. - What does it say?
Go ahead and read it. - What does it say? - Go on and read it.
- What does it say? - Go on and read it. - You read it.
"as the party of the first part." Sounds a little better this time. It grows on you.
-Good morning. I wonder if you'II do me a favor. I have a joint account with my husband and I'd Iike to fix it that nobody can draw the money out but me.
And eyes that smile Lisa! Get off my train!
That's right. Now, that's... Let's get inside.
Even if I call, pay no attention to it. Keep that door locked till dawn. Good night.
There it is, Paul. You can just see it through the trees. Dear old Falden.
I've won! So you've seen this monster before? Yes.
Yes. There was something grotesquely familiar about it. Then it suddenly struck me.
Nick, what'll I do? I know I had it. Don't worry, darling.
We are busy. Where'll I put this ice? - Lay it down and don't bother me.
All right. We'll come. Nickie, I'm sorry.
We'll start the New Year right. - What is it, Henry? The telephone?
- Have you made up your mind? - All right, I'll give you the money. Tonight?
How do I know you'll keep your promise? How do I know you'll really stay away? And, even if... Selma does decide to get a divorce, how do I know you won't fight it?
- What was the shooting? - I guess it was me. Did you get him?
Then, what? - Yes, I mean it. - Of course you're right.
- Yes, I mean it. - Of course you're right. She didn't do it.
- You took what? - I took this picture. I found it in Pedro's apartment.
- It was traced from another check. I still say, so what's it to me? Just a minute, Lieutenant.
You'd only have to show it to prove your innocence. Yet he threw it away. Ask him why.
I had a much nicer voice till I ran a nail through it... You ran a nail through it! Let me hear you sing that again.
You should know the British never surrender. Yet their guns will be useless to them, if I may advise Your Highness. I suspected you had a plan. If Colonel Campbell accepts our terms and he would be exceedingly unwise not to it would be very simple.
Believe me, madame, even at that price... I am not in the habit of bargaining when I see something I want. And I want this necklace.
2,200,000 francs. Tell me, M. Duvalle, exactly how did you arrive at this figure? Dr. Pauquet, I can show you my books.
100 pesetas fine. There's something wrong with my car. I wonder if you can help me.
I'll be through in a second. Don't you like it? Of course.
Don't you like it? Of course. But do you think it goes with those trousers?
But you intended to. I did not. You had it in your eye.
In my stomach? That's what you think. It isn't. It's in the inside pocket of your coat and it isn't chicken anymore.
You know, that's marvellous. I can scarcely believe it. But you're right. It is in my inside pocket.
Do you intend to buy another one? On the contrary. You see, the necklace that you sold mademoiselle is really very beautiful but too expensive for us, and I'm afraid we'll have to return it.
You see, the necklace that you sold mademoiselle is really very beautiful but too expensive for us, and I'm afraid we'll have to return it. - You have it with you, dear? - Yes, darling.
- You have it with you, dear? - Yes, darling. Would it upset you too much if I would ask you to take it back?
Death. Hurry. Hurry, it's almost daylight.
This story is on every wire in the world right now. Yeah, yeah. Now he's innocent. Yeah.
They'll get a legal sentence and a legal death. But I can't do it myself. You'll have to do it for me. You see that? I tore it out of a law book.
But I can't do it myself. You'll have to do it for me. You see that? I tore it out of a law book. My husband says it would be a blessing if the community would forget what happened.
I don't dare sign this, or I would probably get lynched myself. A citizen of Strand." I now draw your attention to this ring.
Hello, Ferryman! Hello! The shortest road to the village is over the moor.
Bill Chandler? Yes. Now, you fired him, the best man we ever had on libel. - You admit it, and you fired him.
- Take his arm. - I'm taking your arm. Yes.
- What is it? - Read it. - What does it say?
Give the gentleman a cigar. I don't quite seem to get it. It's your wrist, sir.
Once and for all, I am not attending the bazaar. Bill, what is it? What is it?
I don't believe it. I won't. Now, Connie, please.
- It's nothing, Bill. - Yes, what about this? I can explain that thing.
- No, but I will get the power of attorney. I asked him what he was going to do with the money. Know what he said?
We lost that much? You see, Mr Deeds, the opera is not conducted for profit. - It isn't? What is it conducted for?
- It's wonderful. - To most people it's an awful let-down. Huh?
- What do you know about that! It's a beautiful little town, too. Grove poplar trees right along main street.
It's about you. Sometimes it's kind of hard for me to say things, so I write 'em. I'd like to read it sometime.
- Stuff, sir? - That goo that tastes like soap. Yes, sir.
- What? - Don't come and ask any of it back. You listen to this - when we make an agreement, it is an agreement.
I got some presents for ya. See? See the pretty feather? Sure. Sure.
Bill, what's in that watch? Bill! Bill, you got my picture. You kept it.
Let's try it again from the beginning. - I'm getting it, aren't I? - Yes.
That's very sweet of you. I'm anxious for Mr. Gordon to see this. It's an interesting experiment. How did you say that last step went?
As if it were all meant to happen. It's quite an experience. It's more than an experience.
Otherwise, the bugs get the whole million. And if you succeed in bringing this good news to your cousin you hope to profit to some extent. Well, I've staked every penny I've got on it.
That's too bad. ─ What? My assistant, Bailey, had his appendix out last night.
That thin line of blood indicating an almost vertical cut. It matches completely the cut on your hand, Lewis. Why, the wound on Dearden's hand is an inch shorter and horizontal. That evidence is going to hang you, Lewis. Unless it was self-defence.
- It's supper after the theater. - Thank you, I'll come with pleasure. And bring this book as a present.
Your grandfather's legacy mustn't be touched. However, I have a few thousand francs I can spare. - You mean, you'll give me the money?
Oh, there you are. Isn't it the most beautiful day? Is it so beautiful?
Well done, well done. Let it stand. - You'll lose it all.
Armand, he's not to blame for what happened. That I swear. Then how could you do what you did? I'll tell you. Because your heart is a thing that can be bought and sold.
I accepted her favors because I thought she loved me. I let her make sacrifices when there were others who had more to give. But bear witness, I owe her nothing.
I let her make sacrifices when there were others who had more to give. But bear witness, I owe her nothing. Take it.
Because I'm dining with her at a quarter to nine. You are a friend of Captain Buckler's. What a lovely song.
What a lovely song. What's the name of it? It has no name.
Why? - A telegram. - Was it so important? - I didn't open it, it was for you.
- Oh... Just... just something I made up. That's nice.
Well, I don't know. The beginning is so beautiful, I wonder if the end matters. It's an old tune, but it's still good.
- All I remember is... - It was glorious, wasn't it? - And what a hotel.
- Let's forget it. Oh! Oh, no.
If I may say so, sir, my favourite opera is Cavelleria Rusticana. It's only one act, but it has everything. Love, jealousy, hate, murder, and all in 35 minutes.
Now, I hope that little story of mine hasn't worried you. It's an unusual story. I shouldn't mind reading it in a novel.
It may be more than love, or less than love. Well, man, make up your mind. What is it?
Well, man, make up your mind. What is it? It's...
Don't be afraid. I won't play it. I shall never play it.
- Didn't you tell me Mr Hamilton is going? - I've changed my mind. Oh, I thought it was only a sub-committee meeting.
Sounds like a description of you. It does, doesn't it? It annoyed me that there should be another woman who looks exactly like me.
It doesn't matter to me whether you go or stay. I was just trying to make it easier for you, that's all. Did you have to throw that gadget away?
And I would be most happy, dear baron. Because I would not be who I am today were it not for you. - I will never forget that.
- I will never forget that. - I did it for my country. Besides...
Did you say I was a sissy? I said some people might think eating off of trays was sissy. Well, let's get something to eat anyway, huh, Harvey?
Well, let's get something to eat anyway, huh, Harvey? You heard me order it. Go ahead, Charles.
It's the very first way anybody ever saw Treasure Island. Gee, it's very valuable, huh? Sure.
- What? I don't know what to do with this. He gave it to me.
You went to the dentist and came back late, and I didn't get a chance to tell you. - I had no idea it was from you. - You kept it, though.
Kind of funny about Eddie stopping where he did. Yes. Yes, it was.
Why, he owns the boat I fell off. - You mean the liner? - Yes, he practically owns it.
And you can go row your old boat all by yourself. I wouldn't go out in it for anything. By golly, that's smart kid.
We have good times together, eh, little fish? We laugh, we sing, so you smile now. Come on, smile.
May I examine this, please? Do you actually give those to your patients? Isn't that awfully large for a pill?
I've got it someplace. I know it's someplace. Here.
Don't look at me. What do you think I am, a peepshow? Get away there, will you? It's rather a strange-looking sight.
No, it's no apple dumpling. No. No.
See he doesn't get on. Put a man at every gate. If that nag slips by you, it means your job. Here. Keep me posted.
With a coal shovel, old cans... We should come up in a garden... behind those buildings... It's open country. Slow work.
Perhaps... I admire your care of your geranium. Not because I have turned botanist.
A party three days and three nights? That's splendido, splendido, magnifico! It isn't a party.
Nick, stop them. It's awful. Please stop them.
So you don't get indigestion. Turkey Morgan's been shooting his mouth off to get Kid Galahad into an early match. You birds said it would draw a million-dollar gate.
I'm dumping my fighter. The more McGraw cracks him up, the better I'll like it. The old wheeze that he double-crossed you, eh?
Not while there's a chance of getting that title from McGraw and Morgan. - You don't think so? - No, I'm sure of it.
They wouldn't be taking us so far on such a dangerous trip. No sense to it. What do you make of it, Bob? You must have some idea.
They must have deliberately brought us here. What reason could they have for doing a thing like that? That's what's on the other side of the hill.
Centuries. Where did you get the money to pay for all these treasures? We have no money as you know it.
What have my books got to do with it? I saw a man whose life was empty. "A man whose life was empty. "
Can you tell me why? Maybe 'cause you've always been part of Shangri-La without knowing it. - I wonder.
- You think it's nonsense? You've been hypnotised by fanatics. I wouldn't believe it in England.
What do you think of his talk about Shangri-La? Do you believe it? Yes. I believe it.
-Not long at all. We met them here on the train. And who did you tell them you were? Spit it out!
Thank you. is it him? -Obviously it is... not!
Give it all up? -Of course! Or don't you understand it yet? -No, I understand everything perfectly.
We didn't do that a single time! Quite the contrary, we contradicted it, right Macky? We denied and repudiated.
- Quick! - Give it to it! Don't let it get away! Hold on there.
- Give it to it! Don't let it get away! Hold on there. It's only Dopey.
Hold on there. It's only Dopey. - Did you see it?
It's only Dopey. - Did you see it? - How big is it?
- Did you see it? - How big is it? - Was it a dragon?
- How big is it? - Was it a dragon? - Has it got horns?
What was it doin'? He says it's a, a monster asleep in our beds! - Let's attack.
He says it's a, a monster asleep in our beds! - Let's attack. - While it's sleeping.
- Hurry, men. It's now or never! - Off with its head. - Break its bones. - Chop it to pieces.
- Jiminy Crickets! - Gosh! - Gee! - What a monster!
- Gee! - What a monster! It covers three beds.
I... I hope you'll accept my apology. Oh, but think nothing of it. Promise me you'll think nothing of it.
Pity? I've a faint suspicion it's more than pity. What a nest for a honeymoon.
Darling, what's happened? Read this. What's this got to do with you?
Alright, bring him to the hospital, immediately. Prepare for a transfusion. Will it be necessary to postpone the execution?
- Robin's right. - Aye! Now, this forest is wide.
Does my lady find it interesting? Lady Marian? - Oh, I'm sorry.
Well, my lady, I have had a nip of ale of a night, just now and again at a place in the town and I won't deny as some of the others were there. Where was it? Oh, Bess, please tell me!
I know, but it's a nice kind of not sleeping. Yes, and it affects your appetite too. Not that I've noticed it's done that to you, except when he was waiting to be hanged.
A blood pressure on yourself? - Yes. Unfortunate that interruption in Mrs. Updyke's boudoir would have been a perfect moment for a blood pressure during the robbery.
- Never mind the alibis. Where's the stuff? - We never laid eyes on it, Jo. The papers carry a big story of what's missing.
This loft has been cleaned out perfectly. How about it, Rocks? You got it?
- Yes. They're covered extensively. - Suppose the cops get hold of this book? - It's very unlikely.
Paradol chloride isn't effective for headaches, if that's what you mean. What's it used for? Well, chiefly insomnia, in minute doses.
- Got any? - Why, certainly. Every doctor has. May I see it?
Clitterhouse, are you stating a hypothetical case or has all this actually happened? - Assume that it has happened. - Well?
-I know. You said it before. -You don't have to worry about it. -I'm not worried.
I took the rap, three years. You took the dough, made connections built it up. For you and me.
I didn't stop him. Well, he got in deeper and deeper. One night, he tried to shoot it out with the cops.
What's up? Is he holding you? -Tell him yes. -Yes.
Sure, you'd like rough stuff. Why, when you can do it nice and legal? No trouble, no fuss.
It's twice as much as I got. -You wanna make something out of it? -No. No.
Why you starting trouble? You pull in your ears. What are we gonna do with it?
But don't forget, I've known that face for a long time. I know you forced Frazier to get you $ 100,000. Everybody knows it. What's the difference where the dough came from?
I know you forced Frazier to get you $ 100,000. Everybody knows it. What's the difference where the dough came from? First place, Frazier owed it to me. It's mine.
Sure. Don't you use it over here? Why, of course we do, for puddings. Oh, we use it for weddings.
Nicole. What happened? You bought it?
Mr. Morris, do you know who broke your window? - Yes, Your Honor. - Pardon me, but does it really matter? It was a free-for-all.
Of course. Do you think it would roll if it were square? I have reference to a mark on the ball. That proves it's a CrowFlight. That's mine.
Maybe for you, but I've got to get to New York. Now one thing's settled, you start worrying about something else. One of us should worry! On top of all this, we've stolen a car!
Now one thing's settled, you start worrying about something else. One of us should worry! On top of all this, we've stolen a car! That's all right. I'll send it back. I don't like it, anyway.
It would go something like this. I'll just prepare for it. Now, let me see.
- No. We've only just left it. But don't you think it's a good idea to go back? No, I think it's a good idea to continue our walk.
Yes, sir. Terribly anxious because I am sure Sorgues was hypnotized. Someone here has the evil eye.
I was counting on your honesty, your loyalty... I see I was mistaken. I swear, Sorgues said nothing.
I wrote it down on the back of an envelope for you. But it's enormous. I'm overcome.
Play it, Neddie. Johnny and I can bear it. Can't we?
Julia was a girl and it seemed hopeless. The next year Mother had me and there was much joy in the land. It was a boy and the fair name of Seton would flourish.
I was going to give a party tonight. I had it all planned. I was going to....
I had it all planned. I was going to.... Well, it was a good idea.
He needs it. Needs it? No, I'm wrong.
I'm not sure I do, Johnny. You wish to occupy yourself otherwise, is that it? Please don't make me feel guilty about it.
You wish to occupy yourself otherwise, is that it? Please don't make me feel guilty about it. Even if it is a fool idea that people dream about and then go flat on.
No, I'm not and that's what scares me most. I feel alive and I love it. I feel at last something's happening to me.
Yes. You think that's right, don't you? - I don't think it matters a bit what I think.
Please, sit down. And I believe that its path that is to say the course of true love, contrary to the adage, should run smooth. I am a man of 58 years and speak from a long experience and observation.
- Yes? If that position at the bank is still open I'll be glad to take it. I'm still not convinced.
- I don't like the color. And does it have to be so tight here? - It binds. And the skirt...
It's no joking matter. Looks mighty serious. More cases than you hear about.
Pres is coming home. Of course. Did you know it?
- We're all very fortunate to be up here. - Are any gentlefolk taken down? Major Crandall's dead with it, for one.
Major Crandall's dead with it, for one. Ned Warrington's got it. No telling how many others.
Oh, admirable, I suppose. It just seems to me there are other things more interesting. I imagine Buck finds it so.
I scared of them gators. I just kind of found me a double-end boat. It ain't like I stealing, Miss Julie.
I knew I was right. But your husband said he didn't see her. He didn't notice, but as soon as he mentioned it, I remembered at once. You win. This calls for action.
If she does not rest I will not answer for her. It will be best if you persuade her. She likes you. I'm as popular as a dose of strychnine.
I'm glad that's over. Heaven knows what the government will say about it. -Nothing at all.
There's some rainwater outside in the bucket. As you wish. Are you an artist? I wish I was. I love the arts.
I was ashamed of the grocery. The grocery should've been ashamed of me. Come on, it's not such a drama.
Orange-blossom crown. Worm in a jar. Veterinary syringe. I'm thinking of it now. I'll dream of it. By noon tomorrow, I'll have found, rented or bought it all.
We should call them Saint Molière and Saint Charlie! But laughter itself. It's an absurd, vulgar convulsion. Don't speak ill of laughter.
Oh, lordy! Here's a new one, Ed. Taste it.
Who said so? Everyone's talking about it. Somebody's buying up everything here.
She hasn't either. I can still hear the tinkle of her thin little voice and see her eyes laughing. That's the reason I've lived in this house so many years and could never move out.
She likes literature and good books. No, because eight years ago, a typewriter was delivered to the house by mistake. If it had been a plough, she'd have taken up farming, huh?
- So is necking. - How much is it? - Ten cents.
- Please don't. It's in my throat. It's fighting to get out.
It's in my throat. It's fighting to get out. I can't hold it back any longer.
- All right. - Tell Donald to hurry. - Yes.
Kind of funny, isn't it? - What's funny about it? The idea of you engineering this thing and being caught in your own trap.
I should have stayed in my own backyard. "Don't worry about me, Mother. I'll get over it. "But, my darlings, I'm so lonesome for you.
- You ought to know it. - Polly Wolly Doodle? We drove you almost crazy with it once.
- Polly Wolly Doodle? We drove you almost crazy with it once. You know it, of course you do.
Lady, that ain't the half of it. This little thing is one of the wonders of the ages. It's a screwdriver, a bottle opener, a cheese slicer, ice pick and vegetable parer.
You're supposed to be a very dangerous character. They told me that a man with your record would never go straight. I'm glad that you proved them wrong. Keep it up, kid.
Well, I get crazy when I think there was another guy, maybe, or... or something, or... Well... Let's skip it, huh?
And the screws wouldn't answer no questions. And then, after lights out... Yeah...
You mean you didn't know it? She's been making a sap out of you all this time? I didn't say nothing, Joe.
And what is the Star of Delhi? Probably the largest emerald in the world, a gift to her majesty from the Maharajah of Rapur. Oh, I shouldn't worry about this, Sir Ronald.
It's a watch fob. Looks like a rabbit's foot. No, no, no.
- Who's life? - Now, Nickie, this is important. This is your responsibility.
- Could be the one that was tossed at me. Not much chance of fingerprints... after the dog's been playing with it for nobody knows how long. I'm apologizing.
All right. - Well, I guess that does it. - Does what?
- That's very nice, but I... - Lois should get some sleep anyway. - Well, thank you very much.
A glass of water. - I'll get it. No, Mrs. Bellam, you stay here.
Look, Nickie, it's smoking. It worked. Give me that rod.
I got sick of playing Little Red Riding Hood to that old guy. When Phil was trying to get money out of him... I found we spoke the same language. I'm not sorry for it.
I count it. What happens? Punchy, what's the matter for you?
Santa Claus, it looks like a white Christmas. If he wakes up, I pity us. Here, hold that.
- Get goin', son. I'll be right with ya. - How 'bout me handling it?
- Don't let me interfere with your dinner, ma'am. It's breakfast. Breakfast, huh?
You should've seen the parasol that came with it. - About the size of a pie. - Ohh! It must've been darling. Make the most of it today.
- Miss Frenchy, honey, you know that blue dress? Well, you can't wear it no more. It's got beer on it.
- I sorta gathered that. - You liked it, huh? - Yeah, it was all right!
- That is, if you don't mind. Please? - It's a mighty fine thing when a man realizes he's wrong... and tries to correct it in a nice way.
Well, how about a nice cold drink? That's great. It will just put me in the mood.
I saved it to wish Ashley a merry Christmas. But you mustn't drink it all at once, because it is the last. I meant it, my dear.
Katie Scarlett! It's over! It's over!
I should've committed robbery to get that tax money for you. I couldn't let you do anything like that. Anyway, it's done now.
You know, Scarlett, I think you're on the verge of a crying jag. So I'll change the subject and say what I came to say. Say it, then, and get out!
What are you thinking about, Scarlett? I'm thinking about how rich we are. I can keep the lumber business too?
Wake up! You were having another nightmare. Rhett, I was so cold and hungry and so tired.
Hold your reins properly in a firm hand. Up! That was fine.
You know it's yours. I don't want it any more than you do. No woman would want the child of a cad like you.
What's the matter, honey? Did you call somebody, child? It's no use.
I wanted you. I wanted you desperately but I didn't think you wanted me. It seems we've been at cross purposes, doesn't it?
- Give that to me! It's awfully dusty, sir. I'll see to it for you, sir.
- Look, over there. - It's a cloud. - Searchlight's got it.
Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound! A hound? Why didn't you report it? Not a soul would have believed it.
I found this: This old document. Legend of the hound of the Baskervilles. Let me read it to you, Mr. Holmes.
What are you doing, Barryman. Oh, nothing sir, it was the window. The window?
I go around every night seeing that they are fastened. Sir Charles always insisted upon it. Well that sounds reasonable enough.
Come on get some clothes we'll find out. It's still there. Yes
Fertile? That's the great Grimpen mire. One false step means death While only yesterday one of the moor ponies wondered into it.
Turn me sick with horror to see it struggling and the sound of its screams... What's that? Oh, that.
Oh, now don't be silly Good night, Beryl. Good night, dear.
And so strangely? What's the matter with the Hunchback? You see?
I didn't know there were women like that. I only told you all this so you'd understand what happened today. I'm glad it happened. Changes a lot of ideas I've had about you. I'm glad, too.
But Maida, darling, I do hope your going abroad at this time won't be a mistake. A mistake? To go away and leave such a fascinating husband around loose. I don't like to tell you this, dear, but... Then I'm sure I won't want to hear it, darling.
That's all any of us can do. Wait, wait. We've been waiting, it's been four months and we're just where we were when we started. Look, dear, do you think I like it? Don't you think it means as much to me as it does to you?
Wait, wait. We've been waiting, it's been four months and we're just where we were when we started. Look, dear, do you think I like it? Don't you think it means as much to me as it does to you? I don't know whether it does or not.
- Not yet. About time we came up with it. - Look to starboard.
So you talked it over, huh? Without me. Well, I don't like it, and it ain't the way I aim to have things.
What? I said is there an armoire in that room? Of course there is.
Spray painting, lead painting. Lead painting's no good, just like the sand gun. When I couldn't fight it anymore, I just gave in.
Thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. - Beautiful, isn't it?
I've never seen this before. - Beautiful, isn't it? - Yes, it is.
I feel very sorry for you. But you must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles. Look at it.
I see a house. Looks like any other house. - What's remarkable about it?
- It's not the structure. It's the spirit that dwells within it. It has three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
"Is it true that a lot of people live on the moon?" The other one says, "Sure it's true, about 500 million." Then the first one says:
- Yeah. Maybe it's in here. - Just a little knob.
- Ever since you've been back from Paris-- I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
Yes, there's no doubt of that. Just look out of the window and there it is. And it's great.
Can you blame them? At least the May Day parade is over. That's another thing.
Isn't it wonderful? - Tell us, Ninotchka. - Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski--
- Tell us, Ninotchka. - Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski-- Now, please don't start figuring it out in cows.
- It may step out of a bazaar. It may be waiting for you in a corridor. It may hide in the shadow of a minaret.
- By the way, I almost forgot. I brought this for you. Funny.
You did, didn't you? It's in her family, isn't it? I thought everybody knew that too.
You adopt Tina? If she has my name, the Ralston name and part of the Ralston fortune... - Why haven't you mentioned this plan?
That's the most wonderful thing I've ever seen. Yes, reminded you of a great, beautiful bird, didn't it? It didn't at all.
Yes, reminded you of a great, beautiful bird, didn't it? It didn't at all. That's why it's so wonderful.
But one night when I was lost in a fog and was glad to get back down, what do you think the welcome-home speech was? She'd hoped I'd crashed. - What? - She couldn't stand the gaff.
She'd hoped I'd crashed. - What? - She couldn't stand the gaff. Said she'd rather see me dead, have it over with.
- That was a million years ago. - What's the matter with your foot? - I slipped on the porch. - Don't walk around on it.
Stop it! No. No, go on.
He shall be recalled. I don't know how to thank Your Majesty. But it's doubtful if he'll come.
Well, they may. I'll put an end to it. Not another man goes to Ireland.
You're even more splendid than I'd imagined. Even in my retreat, news came of that silver armor of yours. -I was ill.
I promise. Now we must go and talk of Ireland. This deficit has grown to alarming proportions.
Give me the men I need. Put me in command. If I fail to crush Tyrone, take my sword.
They couldn't have done it without my help. Essex, thinking himself forgotten turned against you, but it wasn't his fault. He didn't know.
You spoil me for death. Wouldn't it have been kinder to have left me with my thoughts? Are you so set on dying?
I'll try too. The Minister couldn't be here but he wishes to express his admiration and sincere congratulations. It's mainly a matter of equipment.
I can well imagine how it went. He was going to risk his life. How could you have refused him this small mark of loving friendship that he must have been begging for?
-They're nice but very damaging. Here, look. How beautiful!
A gun bullet. Does it surprise you? -Christine has disappeared! -She disappeared.
Don't let it fall. That's the way they teach you in dancing school. I don't know.
Now with me. You must be very fond of that piece. They've played it every time we've danced.
I'm awfully sorry. Honest. I won't do it anymore. Please don't stop dancing.
But he's afraid that if the Indians see him coming, they'll- - I have to see Mr. Big Eagle somehow, before it gets dark. - It won't do any good, Sue. It will.
Okapi? Never heard of it. A very rare animal.
Never heard of it. A very rare animal. The old-time hunters used to think it was a cross between a giraffe and a zebra.
Thank you. Whenever it's convenient. We shall be about here for a day or two.
Established custom? If it's ivory the party's after... the hunter in charge usually gets 10% of whatever they bring out. Very well.
I hear a beat How sweet! Just to register emotion Jealousy, devotion And really feel the part
What'll we do? Help! Help!
And remember, my sentimental friend that a heart is not judged by how much you love but by how much you are loved by others. It ticks! Listen!
That's all it is. But that's so easy! I should've thought of it for you.
Remember me your old pal, Hunk? And me Hickory? You couldn't forget my face, could you?
Go on. This manicurist, she's perfectly divine, she said to me: "I know something about rich Mrs. Haines." But, Sylvia, suppose Mary should hear about it? Wouldn't it be terrible?
- It's divine. - Don't tell me, but how much is it? - Two hundred and twenty-five.
- It is a nightgown, isn't it? - Yes. I'd be glad to wear it for an evening gown. Isn't she naive?
Mary, you poor darling, I could die for you. What's the matter? I don't want it.
I brought the inventories of the furniture. Mr. Haines wants to know if he can have the portrait of Little Mary. - Oh, yes, but it's in storage.
I'm going to prepare the supper with my own little hands. - Lucy, any mail? - Here it is, my lady.
You can't light it but it looks awful cute. - What turns into a fireplace? - This gig in the corner.
- Or anything. - You said it. When you've got it right in your mitts, they leave you with your tongue hanging out.
What is the meaning of this demonstration, Mr Waterbury? I demand an explanation, and it had better be good. It is very good, sir.
The crank fits on here and when you turn it it... Makes into a full-size double bed at night. Guy said it works swell. What did you go get that for?
Guy said it works swell. What did you go get that for? Well, we kinda hoped that it might make up for the... phoney telegram.
Some scientists think that great droughts and earthquakes turned the whole world into a gigantic dustbowl. In any case, the dinosaurs were wiped out. That is where our story ends.
They'll blow his head off if he goes out West with that flea incubator. What's the matter with that hat? It cost a lot of money.
- No, it wasn't a pigeon. It was green. Must have been a frog.
Joseph Panello. That's rich and rare. A business transaction, Joe.
You can't miss it. Say, you can do me a favor. I got a telegram for Dan Wilson.
I got a telegram for Dan Wilson. You can deliver it and save me the trip. Sure, we'll deliver the telegram.
You promise? Right. All right.
Some say I am. You wanna hear how it happened? That's what I' asking you, ain't it?
Yeah, but you don't understand, son. This is my land! Used to be.
- What's so funny about that? What's so funny about it? I've just been out there.
I know, ma'am. Only, it's for an old lady. No teeth.
How's it feel? Busted my cheek, but I can still see. - What did you hear?
I didn't know what I was doing any more than when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was going to do it. Oh, it's all right, Tommy.
I look over behind the eight rock, and do you know what happened to the eight rock? Come in. Come in.
they wouldn't believe it. That's right. Even if it was true, they wouldn't believe it.
That's right. Even if it was true, they wouldn't believe it. Here it is, Miss Catherine.
Even if it was true, they wouldn't believe it. Here it is, Miss Catherine. It took them a little longer than...
What do we need it for? This one is falling apart. Look.
in a dark chamber my heart is awake it sleeps and waits, wondering where the dream may carry it do you hear, my heart? do you hear, my heart? it finds the way by the power of the stars it finds you and happily laughs my heart
councils take place without me documents are signed without my name am I the king or am I not? you're the queen's husband and your son's father, Maria, you seem to have forgotten you never think about me, everything else is more important to you, this and this and that why do you look at me like this?
I have sung, I wrote poems, and nothing has remained but you are here, Maria you are the life life? doesn't it pass us all by? and we watch it go by? one can catch it no, no!
I have become ugly you won't be able to love me any more it's smallpox does it hurt?
Yes, yes, right now. All right. Just a minute.
Did you see her when that bell went off? It must be pretty nice to be able to walk out of a place and quit. I had a publicity job offered to me last year.
And it wasn't exactly mine. It's Bruce's money and I want it back. Bruce's money?
My wallet? This is my wallet. Say, there's something funny going on... What are you doing?
- I am looking at you, you murderer. If it was my own grandmother, I'd carry on. - You know I would, for the paper.
If you were out joyriding plastered, or got into a scrape, why don't you admit it instead of accusing innocent people? You ruffian! How dare you talk like that to me! He's just crazy, Mother.
Surely nothing would have been said to you... ... iftheownerweren'tquiteprepared to sell it. That's true.
Who has the letter? Hammond's widow. And she threatens to turn it over to the prosecution. Well, what if she does?
I had nothing else to do. It appealed to me. It must take enormous concentration...
It appealed to me. It must take enormous concentration... ... andpatience. I find it soothing.
He wants the money to buy the estate. -He can't. He hasn't got it. -Give me time. Where's the letter? I have it in my pocket.
If only there were some other way. Tell him and have done with it. Now, this is really a handsome estate.
Yes. I'd almost forgotten about that. -You were going to... ? -l had to pay a great deal of money for it. Well, if you thought it necessary, I'm not going to grouse.
Darling, you've done something to this sleeve. A cigarette burn. That's what it is. And your new coat too. Never mind.
(CHUCKLING) So, this bird killed the black-breasted red? - Yes, Your Excellency.
She's been at me night and day to take her there. This should do it. This should suit that maniac.
I think that's queer, indeed. - It's queerer than that. It's paranoiac.
A nice story for Spy, incidentally. Too bad we can't supply photos of you. The fuss you made over that childish episode!
An understanding heart. Without that, you might as well be made of bronze. That's an awful thing to say to anyone.
And remember, Mike with the rich and mighty... Do you know what time it is? It's after 4.
- You. And some clothes. Wasn't it funny?
- You seen Kidd? - I left a copy of it at my house for him. - And?
You're in great shape. Tell me, what did you think of my wedding present? I like my presents at least acknowledged.
- Not necessarily. - You keep out of this. You forget I am out of it.
And if we don't, maybe we ought to. Liz... You see, it really wasn't Tracy at all, Mr. Kittredge.
-I protest! Capt. Thorpe, you will at least show the proper respect for my ministers. So you have taken it upon yourself to remedy the defects of Spanish justice? Insofar as it lies within my power, yes, Your Grace.
No, thanks. I'm on the grape-juice wagon. Antro.
A baby? Does he laugh by the hour, or is it piecework? You had a good laugh the other night too, didn't you?
- What's that? - Oh, that? Uh, nothing. Uh...
When he thinks of all the years he's been in the Navy and all he's worked for has gone by the board, he's gonna hate your insides. You can't get the Navy out of your heart and your blood, honest you can't. If he didn't kill you, you'd do it yourself.
I think it's great. Well, open it. No, Mr. Matuschek, it's not for us. But you haven't listened to it.
No, I'm not complaining. It's quite a bit of money. Yeah, all right.
Sir, for several days your attitude toward me seems to have changed. - Has it? - Yes, Mr. Matuschek, it has.
On one side... Here, I'll show you. On one side, I put a picture of my wife and on the other side, my little baby.
Ain't for me. Hey, Red, this steak's tough. You can't send it back now.
Don't get hot. - I'll give you a check. - What'll we do, use it for a tire patch?
Sure you can. It's our new house. I want you to see it.
- That door it opened. - Of course it did. We broke the ray.
The doors made me do it. The doors made me do it! - Matron, remove the witness.
- How can a dog tell bad from good? - See for yourself. Now, by the wonder of Allah -
If Your Highness would wind it yourself. What's it going to do? Hmm? Move its legs, or arch its neck? Or - Or wag its tail?
I am a bird! I'm the king of birds! No! Oh.
No! Oh. Mmm, I want it! I want it. I must have it, and I'll give you anything you wish for it.
Always Jaffar. It was in my house you were cared for, to sleep your sleep... and dream to its end... your first dream of love. It was I who woke you. No.
- Go down and tell them. - All right. When you're through with that, I'd like to have it back. I'd like to keep that particular piece of paper myself.
I'll call Mr. Bernstein and have him put off my appointments till noon. What time is it? I don't know. It's late.
You're a success. Look! A peanut. Come on, eat it.
Look! A peanut. Come on, eat it. It's got lots of vitamins.
The southern part of Trinidad. Pardon me. Thank you.
Give it to me. - I'll give it to Madame. - No.
- No. I have to give it to her personally. This way.
I have to give it to her personally. This way. Are you noticing how it drapes?
- We won't take no for an answer. - Charles. - I order you to sing, my dear.
- It's very important he gets it. - Why? Have you read it?
And spirits of spinach. Go on, it's good for you. No, boys, I'm going to eat food.
- See? It's all tarnished. Won't that make a pretty souvenir after it's polished?
Hey! That's Private Meeley's tobacco! So it is.
That's Private Meeley's tobacco! So it is. I'll take it outside and sift it.
I'll never forget it. That was terrible. - Say, Ollie. - What?
I know the song. Anyway, what's money? - Mere scraps of paper.
How do you like that? He ain't even a first-class private. I think he is.
I've been taking a lesson in photography. Well, you seem unusually happy about it. I am.
But I have a date with Ginger. Daniel, you shouldn't go out with girls. It's dangerous.
Daniel, you shouldn't go out with girls. It's dangerous. It might affect your heart.
It's dangerous. It might affect your heart. It has already.
- What? I feel like a mouse. We had to do it.
All right, come on. Pile out of there. - What will we do?
They've got no money or insurance. It's murder. Tough luck, Pfiffer.
Then straight to Mrs Tossal the Shop, for that toffee which you could chew for hours, it seems to me now. And even after it had gone down, you could swallow and still find the taste of it hiding behind your tongue. It is with me now, so many years later.
You will come to no good end. At least I am not sitting on it, talking rubbish in chapel. - Look here...
Our son is a scholar. What is it, Huw? I can't make sense with it.
No, thanks. I'd rather pay 32,000 than lose a really large amount. This is very embarrassing. Just make it out to cash.
I'll probably talk like a cockeyed duchess the rest of my life. It won't even take six weeks. One day about two weeks from now, we'll be riding in the hills, past waterfalls and mountain greenery, up and down ravines and around through vine-covered trails... till we come to a spot where the scenery will be so gorgeous,
I'm sorry, Eve. He won't do it. I thought it was a pretty fair offer.
He won't do it. I thought it was a pretty fair offer. As a matter of fact, I think you're a sucker to make it.
Can I hide behind the sanctity of my client's identity secrets and whatnots all the same, priest or lawyer? But Dundy's getting a little rambunctious, and maybe it is a bit thick this time. What'll it cost to be on the safe side?
I shall be able to have the money for you at, say, 10:30 in the morning. But I haven't got the falcon. I'll have it in another week at the most, though.
You. It's you who bungled it. You and your stupid attempt to buy it! Kemidov found out how valuable it was!
[Brigid sobs] Listen. This won't do any good.
Is it real silver? Better. It's chromium.
- There you are, sir. - One pound, 20 shillings. I give you change.
If you don't mind, we'll check the amount. No, no. I'll just take £500.
And, uh, Saul, you can instruct her how to deposit it. - Very good. - I don't want it.
Mr. Stokes, care of the post office at Lyme Regis. - Lyme Regis. - Uh, have you got a pencil?
I have no desire to enter a cave after a trapped animal... even though I know you have no weapons. I admired your stone door so much that I imitated it... by wedging another stone on the outside. You're sealed up, as in a grave.
- Now you're being sensible. - Have you got It? - What Is It?
Certainly. It's on the stick. Pull It In.
Hand it out through the venthole. Your time Is up. I'm waiting.
Your time Is up. I'm waiting. And be sure It's signed.
I'm waiting. And be sure It's signed. There It Is.
Mr. Smith, it's me, Sammy, from the office. Mr. Custer says you'll have to sign this. We can't keep postponing the case.
Mr. Custer says you'll have to sign this. We can't keep postponing the case. Push it under the door.
Your nose is bleeding. Are you sure that stuff is good for a nosebleed? Best thing in the world.
Can you give it to me? No, I gotta give it to him. I'm going away, see?
- A camellia doesn't have any fragrance. - It doesn't need any around you. I'm glad you like my perfume. It's new.
While I was there, Miss Porter came in. She'd been there before. That's a lie!
Well, gentlemen and ladies we have our murderer. Nicky, I can't stand it! Was it me?
Nicky, I can't stand it! Was it me? Yeah, Nick, is it her?
Well, he won't have to no more. Please don't go thisaway. He'll get over it.
- Tom says I was to give it to you. I'd be scared to hold all that. I ain't never had no money.
Ain't I always told you the truth? Ain't I kept money for you? I ain't gonna touch it. Keep the money or throw it away.
How come? I couldn't stand it if you got down on me too. Is it something you done?
It's like a box, and you can hear music and voices coming right out of it. You mean the box can talk? Not really.
There's lots of it on the bottom. Lots of it. What do you do with it?
It's a new drug that works wonders in cases such as this. - Elliott's already sent a runner for some. - Where?
- Supper? What about that wood? Well, there it is, can't you see it?
What about that wood? Well, there it is, can't you see it? How come I can still see it?
You're the craziest old fool I guess I ever did see. That's the fourth time you've taken that same load to town and brung it back. Ain't even had it out of the car.
How much rent would it be, Payne? Hundred dollars for the year. Hundred dollars?
I told you you could do it, Dude boy. Oh, ain't this a pretty automobile? Oh, I knew you could do it, Dude boy.
- But he ain't here. - I know, but it don't seem just right. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. I ain't stealing it. I'm just figuring on selling it and giving Henry half of that money.
- Did you hurt the car much? - Oh, not the running of it. - And the horn wasn't hurt none.
- This one? - Yeah, it's brand-new. It ain't been hardly broke in yet.
Why, you made a mistake. This is my place, boy. Maybe I did, but I had to do it.
So much so that this morning I was walking down Fifth Avenue I saw something rather beautiful that reminded me of you. I wanted you to have it very much, and so I bought it for you. This couldn't be a diamond bracelet, could it?
The funny thing was that when my wife found that in my pocket she thought that I was the one who bought it for you. How could you possibly think such a thing? Because I know Martin.
Because I know Martin. Do you like it, Sheila? Like it?
That's bracelet talk. Sure it is, but not the way you think it is. That bracelet happens to mean an awful lot to me.
Sure it is, but not the way you think it is. That bracelet happens to mean an awful lot to me. It brought us together.
That bracelet happens to mean an awful lot to me. It brought us together. Well, that's one way of looking at it.
What are you doing here? This happens to be my apartment. I'm sorry. I didn't know.
Honestly, Maggie? You telling me the truth? It's better than that. I think it's great. May I take it with me?
You telling me the truth? It's better than that. I think it's great. May I take it with me? I wanna read it again myself. Sure.
We are not amused. Bert read me his play. It's superb. It's not just a play by a newspaperman.
Bert read me his play. It's superb. It's not just a play by a newspaperman. It's really superb, cries out for Cornell.
- Darling. What? Darling, why do I have to come there?
Oh, it's just a trifle. But I wanted you to have it. It's a picture of me as I used to be.
But I wanted you to have it. It's a picture of me as I used to be. It was taken on another Christmas Eve many years ago.
- Inflato? - Yes, the name of this little device. Inflato, taken from the word "inflation."
Let me try it. Wait a minute, maybe I... Let me try, see if I can't get this thing...
Well, what happened, sir? - Somebody slugged me. - Oh, well that's too bad.
A gentleman inside has won 20,000 francs and the cashier would Iike some money. - I'lI get it from the safe. I'm so upset. You know-
Play "As Time Goes By." I can't remember it. I'm a little rusty on it. I'll hum it for you.
That's the way it goes. One in, one out. - Sam. - Yes, boss.
- I don't. You played it for her, you can play it for me. - I don't remember-
You played it for her, you can play it for me. - I don't remember- - If she can stand it, I can.
Can I tell you a story, Rick? Has it got a "wow" finish? I don't know the finish yet.
Back home most of us would kill rattlesnakes whether there was a bounty on them or not. But you're protecting your home. This is not our home. It's not our fight.
You're on. Take a bow. So this is Holiday Inn. Yeah, will be if it ever opens up.
Well, here's what cooks. Oh! Why, this is darling.
Yes, come in. What's that? Well, I thought it over, and I believe our number would go better in blackface.
Well, that was before I... before I thought it over. I'll look terrible in the stuff. No.

For heaven's sake, be good. What'll I do with the coat? When you're through with it, send it to the police.
Now, you get back in that body. No. I didn't like it.
Tax payments have been coming up against the old Timberlake-Fitzroy Corporation. There's no sense in throwing money away on a dead company. This statement says the corporation's dissolved.
Are you going to let them...? I'll never stand in their way. Craig's a lawyer.
Peter, I've got a surprise for you. Where'd you get it? Ask no questions.
- I quite understand, my dear. Besides, it is Stanley's car. It's just standing idle in the garage.
Life and death happen. If it hadn't been for me, he'd still be alive. He'd still be alive.
- Good night. What is the matter, Stanley? Stanley, what is it?
Craig, I've got a favor to ask of you. Would you explain this to me? It's Peter's.
- You see, he was going to wash it, but... - Oh, Stanley, it wasn't. It couldn't have been.
- Well I hardly think it would be fair to give names. - Look here. One of your best friends is that mother of Charlie Johnson's across the way. - Has she ever mentioned this to you? - Well she may have intimated it...
Such a little short strength it would need. don't strike my life down twice, dear. This time I've not deserved it.
- Get up, aunt Fanny! - It's not hot, it's cold. The plumbers disconnected it. I-I wouldn't mind if they hadn't!
George Amberson Minafer had got his come-uppance. He got it three times filled, and running over. But those who has so longed for it were not there to see it.
It's later, making it happen, that it's difficult. What's that? Leave it. I took it from a friend with dark thoughts.
Gloria... I won't say it again, Gloria. Sorry.
- At your service. I had the photos. One of them in particular hurt me.
I was still kidding myself. For a moment, I thought she'd tell me everything. She'd actually pawned her bracelet for money.
And they're trying it on. It's only human. They're going back tomorrow.
A bird is nice, it sings, whistles, preens itself, but you're not sure where it will land. Oh, shit. I can't do these baby clothes.
- No. That's impossible. It's impossible. It's despicable.
It was you. Gloria, please. Gloria, open up.
She locks her door. Make a note of it. Significant, isn't it?
- I've been thrown out of better places. This morning I referred to a quotation, remember? Yes, Walt Whitman's.
I should have this morning. Isobel gets nervous. Of course.
- We promised to meet Deb for dinner. How much farther is it? Don't look, just listen.
Lisa and I bought it in New York. Outrageous. Where's the black and white foulard?
Give me Longacre 56599, please. You see, it's strong and safe. It's simple and practical. It lets the light and air through and it's practically invisible from below.
Every municipality, every town, every city needs one. My patent is basic. $99,000 is a lot of money.
Just like that. I mean, sex didn't even enter into it. Oh, but of course it did, darling.
Really? This is very illuminating. Well, you don't have to get rigid about it.
In cash. So I won't stop the check, the scoundrel... I don't mean me, I mean that whoever's... Well, I don't think he'll ever get it.
My sister and your brother. It would be nice if something came of it. Oh, yes, wouldn't it?
It would be nice if something came of it. Oh, yes, wouldn't it? It would be wonderful for him.
I didn't realize it was so humorous. Did you really want to put me through all that? I'm afraid I'm...
Did you really want to put me through all that? I'm afraid I'm... There's no use trying to conceal it now.
Snoodles is going to build your airport for you. Why should he build it? I'll build it.
But what about the $99,000? He didn't want that, I wanted it for him. But...
You'll get over it. You know about Gerry's decision? Yes.
I wanted to prove that you could look Pittsburgh in the eye and laugh at him. That he could take you in his arms, you could still laugh, and mean it. We did prove it, didn't we?
Nobody'll ever like or trust you again. We'll see about that. I'll make 'em like me.
Go back? It is best, Smithy. You need care, and you need doctors that understand your case.
Isn't it wonderful? Sam's all right. Now you have nothing to worry about, nothing.
Aren't you ever going to tell me what's in it? I can't believe it. It's fantastic. Darling, please, I can't stand it another second.
I can't believe it. It's fantastic. Darling, please, I can't stand it another second. It's from Liverpool, from the editor of The Mercury.
My word. Do you like it? My dear, you look adorable.
Oh, no. Would it be too incredible? - It would be fantastic.
Would it be too incredible? - It would be fantastic. - Then it is fantastic.
But now, I'm rather losing my nerve. Why? Is it so startling? It may sound outrageous to you, but it's not a sudden impulse.
Come on. It's port. That's larboard to me.
Heave him over. - Jack, that paper has your name on it. - What?
Jack. Was it Drusilla? Yes.
Yes, and Romulus doesn't like fish much, either. Bolt the faceplate home. The wreck moved!
Ken said, "Don't I get to play too?" He was kidding. I handed it to him. Fry was right there with us, I'm sure!
Maybe you'd like to come inside and get dry. Did you leave your car down on the road? Put it in the shed.
Why not? You think they got the place spotted? I'm making sure. You'll have to find another place and store all this stuff. It's not gonna be easy.
I'm making sure. You'll have to find another place and store all this stuff. It's not gonna be easy. If you can't handle it, I'll have to get someone else.
Okay. Just keep in touch. I'm glad we came this way. It adds a few miles, but I've become a little sentimental. I want to take a last look at it.
I never get a chance to get out. I just sit around all day, and I never see anything. So I said, the first vacation I get, I'm going to see the Statue of Liberty. This must be a big moment for you, huh? Oh, it is.
Yes. This is Miss Eberli. Why...why someone must have stolen it.
Now I can be frank with you, Mr. Holmes. Dr. Tobel has disappeared. They found my car on Richmond Bypass wrecked.
Well, I expected you but not with my revolver. You realize, of course, when I was brought into the room blindfolded - I heard the mechanism of this door. - Of course.
Tell me what Christopher means. Well, don't anybody know? Its got to mean something.
This calls for action and lots of it. There's something curious about this broadcast. He said tomorrow.
- Percentage is with the house. Pretty hard to beat. But it has been done, hasn't it? So they tell me.
- My uncle must have signed it. Which doesn't make it so funny. - Why not?
And what's that? - It's the coffee boiling. - Take it off.
Beet soup with sour cream. It's a Polish dish. With an egg in it.
- We must have some, Miss Shelley. - Of course. As soon as I finish my course in American cooking...
- A quart. - Yes. With an egg in it.
Why can't 100 policemen find one man with a bad ankle? What the dickens is that to you? Nothing.
Will somebody listen to me? Bracken's alive. Why should Dilg go to jail?
The way it suddenly shot up above the clouds? Another couple of feet, we'd smack right into it. - Still looks like Africa to me.
Sweetheart, darling, I love you. Don't you know that? Don't you feel it? If anything happened to you...
Don't you know that? Don't you feel it? If anything happened to you... You think I can do it?
Kate screamed and dropped the lantern. Then I-Then it-it-it closed in on me like- like a blast from a furnace. Only it wasn't hot, it- it was-
Then I-Then it-it-it closed in on me like- like a blast from a furnace. Only it wasn't hot, it- it was- It was simply horrible.
Only it wasn't hot, it- it was- It was simply horrible. Kate screamed again and... then I was fighting it.
I'll run along. I'm sure by tomorrow the police will find out what it was. I've done it, Bob.
If you want to know more about it, there's a family history in the library. Thanks. I'll have a look at it.
- I'm not convinced it is a man. - A woman? Animal, vegetable or mineral?
Well, Inspector, that blows up your spook theory. What's happened? It was sealed in this tube and vacuum.
There was no reason for mentioning it. Had no bearing on the case. She didn't die from the venom.
Had no bearing on the case. She didn't die from the venom. - But you did inject it into her veins. - No.
- Christy! - Oh, Bob. For a moment I thought you were the monster. Quick.
Oh, so you were the one who stole it. Yes. Yes, I'd hoped to keep you from finding out. That their ancestors were balmy?
Yes. Yes, I'd hoped to keep you from finding out. That their ancestors were balmy? Well, let us say, rather, that their ancestors... handed it down from father to son throughout the ages.
That's wonderful! Oh, don't take it wrong, Mrs. Craig. I'm just so excited.
You gotta stay off your feet, you know... Tess, I hope it's a boy. - Oh, you sweet...
Tess, I hope it's a boy. - Oh, you sweet... - It is a boy.
Be not moved in your devotion. Believe in the ideal. You saw it once.
We're not leaving without it. I've had experience. Hand it over. Tell you where his money is if you're so anxious.
Send a man forward to secure the bulkhead. All hands to the cargo winch! Bring your guns to starboard and hold fire.
No! - And finally, maybe we could be Marines? But did that discourage them?
- That's nonsense. It's true, that beast came to hurt us. It's an innocent animal.
A bluebird used to come here, it brought joy and sincerity. And a toad that made us feel compassionate. Mother St John's cat ate them.
I loved the world I left. You don't know how much I loved it. I ripped it from my heart to come here.
What's it called? That is called the "Dance of the Pelican" my own original creation. Now, girls, we'll try some bar exercises. Right over here.
Mickey, you draw Chambersburg. You can take Jasper along as your croaker. Croaker?
He had some money in the bank, and he wouldn't draw it out. And you know what? He lost his job.
This is really something. All ready? Now, we'll dirty it up a little.
Not before the attack, they'd rebuild it. It must go the minute the attack starts, no sooner, no later. So the bridge is nothing.
If a Gypsy catches rabbits, he says it's foxes. - If he catches a fox, he'll call it an elephant. - And if I catch an elephant?
If you see soldiers, throw a stone for a signal. Wait a minute. - If you see one soldier, raise your rifle like this.

- I thought you were guarding it. - I slept with your things! - You slept well!
I've been politically disconnected for over 15 years now. You tell it to A... A entrust it to B, B confines in C...
No, my friend... let's have it just as it stands. Fellow patriots, there's work to be done. Raise the invisible torch and pass it along... Keep it burning...
- Something to wear. - Let's see now. ls it a tie? - l'm not telling. I'll give you a hint.
Mother, I want you to look at this. - Do you think Martha will like it? - Oh, it's beautiful.
I don't know. It's a hard decision to make, but yours is only a technical responsibility. Technical responsibility. Real responsibility. The question is, will she live or die?
A missionary's widow? Isn't very likely, is it? I don't mean believe in it like believing in a religion.
Isn't very likely, is it? I don't mean believe in it like believing in a religion. I mean, do you believe it has power?
It was never out of my sight until I put it into the safe. He's even used a copy of the Daily Planet. He never dropped it on the floor?
That money belongs to Miss Cowan. You know very well you stole it from her mother. Why, you.
Claudio. No, no, no, it wouldn't be there. It's a large manuscript in a portfolio.
You don't understand, mademoiselle. It's the only copy I have. It represents two years' work. You heard what the lady said.
It represents two years' work. You heard what the lady said. But it was brought into this office.
It's not from an opera, Raoul. It's a lullaby. A lullaby.
I think he's gonna fight us. Give me something white to wave. Make it snappy.
It's going to waste! Waco, get some cans and some ropes from the tank. Heads up. Here it comes.
We must get water. How's it coming? Very good, Sergeant. Very nice.
How's it coming? Very good, Sergeant. Very nice. Any way to squeeze it out quicker?
Very good, Sergeant. Very nice. Any way to squeeze it out quicker? It takes its own time.
Let me take your place for a while. No, it isn't necessary. How's it coming?
- What kind of cheese, Frenchie? - It is from my village. Never heard of it.
Here we are. Here are the Germans, and here's what happens. You hit it right on the nose.
I look at it this way. Because it is a 100-to-1 shot. Because there's so little chance of any of us coming out of it.
I like to travel. It broadens the mind. I wish you weren't so cocky about it.
Go ahead! There it is! Drink all you can find! Go on, take it!
There it is! Roll in it! Swim in it!
I think tunes jump from head to head. Do you know whatit is, Uncle Charlie? Uh, no.
OK? And you tear it down here. And you tear it there. You fold it over here at the side. Fold over the other side here.
Because Captain Vickery will be much safer in the local police station tonight than he would be in this house. Oh, Mr. Holmes, what am I going to do? Watson, get your sedative.
Just what sort of formula? Oh, it's some meaningless words, Musgrave ritual, they call it.
Yes, that's right, I did. Let me see now. "Who first shall find it were better dead
"Who first shall find it were better dead Who next shall find it perils his head. The last to find it defies dark powers."

When Miss Sally forgot the lines today you were the one who prompted her. Well, sir I memorized it. Obviously but why?
Her mind. We must search her mind. Obviously, she took great pains to hide that paper.
She must have packed that paper under this cushion. She must have changed her mind. Obviously.
She must have changed her mind. Obviously. Well she could have hidden it anywhere here.
It's a burial crypt. Up with it. I say, there's somebody down there.
Up with it. I say, there's somebody down there. Who is it?
I don't know. Stay where you are. Who is it, Holmes?
Yes. We told you, you were taking an awful risk. Well we had to have a confession and these egomaniacs are always so much more chatty when they feel they have the upper hand. Shall we go?
Obviously Watson, one of 'em died before passing on the meaning of the ritual to his heir. The words remain but the sense was lost. I wonder why he left the grant down there where he found it.
What's this? Watson this microscope was last used for examining microfilm. I'm beginning to see the pattern.
Message? What do you mean? They want us to believe that they found the document and therefore have no further use for Grayson. Well if that's true then we're done for.
I'm not so sure that it is true Watson. If they have the document why they wasting time sending me this? No.
This blanket has had a most varied history. It's been on a many a sea voyage. The latest not six months ago.
Mrs. J. Wellington, Junior, Duponte Circle. Good night.
Interesting piece. Spanish isn't it? Moorish. Oh, my error.
Look at that tree. Yes, it bows in sorrow. No, in longing.
Yes, it bows in sorrow. No, in longing. It grieves over us.
While I hum for him a song about us two. Isn't it lovely to think about? Yes.
Yes. It is only a dream. What does it matter?
You asked if I ever wished you were dead. I have wished it hundreds of times. I wished it when you were with me.
I have wished it hundreds of times. I wished it when you were with me. I wished it when you left me.
Repulsive. Well, sir, there's nothing ratty about it. Perhaps you're right, doctor.
What's the row about? A registered package for Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Oh, he'll sign for it. Thank you, sir.
Oh, how simply breathtaking. You like it? Why I'm mad about it.
Why I'm mad about it. You must let me take it back to the jeweler, have it properly marked. AS or just Andrea?
Don't be cryptic, darling. Look at that. What of it?
Thank you. Yes, isn't it? I picked it up quite by accident.
Yes, isn't it? I picked it up quite by accident. Wasn't a mark on it except some negligible fingerprints that the police couldn't identify.
You got something to tell me... You're wasting your time. - You know what's going to happen to him?
Mortimer, don't be so inquisitive. The gentleman died because he drank some wine with poison in it. How did the poison get in the wine?
This is Mortimer Brewster. I'll tell you why I called you. It's about Teddy. I've got to come over and see you right away.
He doesn't live with us. I can see the headlines now. Please. I'd like to see the room.
You have the word of the President of the United States. Cross my heart and hope to die. Now, let's see.
A little higher, brother. Thank you very much. Don't do that, please. That won't have any effect. I've tried it before--
Sometimes it goes on like that all night. - Really? - Yes. Maybe we'd better go to your house, huh? No, dear.
- Here, hold this. I'll climb up and I'll see. - Never mind, I'll climb up.
Now, there, you'd hardly know there had been a spot on it. Gee, that's swell. That's a wonderful machine.
What do you want us to do with it? I don't want you to do anything with it, except to guard it with your lives. The utmost secrecy must be observed.
I don't want you to do anything with it, except to guard it with your lives. The utmost secrecy must be observed. If the wrong people learned what I have in mind and it was discovered, it might alter the whole course of the war.
That's just what I'm working on. Good night. He must have given me the wrong key.
He must have given me the wrong key. - Let me try it now. Maybe I can fix it. - All right.
- Yes. Come on. That's deep enough.
At a deserted airfield, about two miles away there is an obsolete plane equipped with radio control and a robot plane. It will be flown directly over this battery and you will attempt to blow it out of the sky. All right, sergeant, start the plane.
Never, ma'am. I made this myself, Mr. Cody. I hope you'll enjoy it.
Indian! What is it? What did I say to offend you?
What is it? What did I say to offend you? Please, I'd rather you kept it.
What did I say to offend you? Please, I'd rather you kept it. It was so becoming to you.
Bill! Diphtheria. What's that?
Where does it come from? From water systems. From sewage.
That's all, brother. This is where you live, beautiful. Not me. Lend me your car for a while?
You were pretty good in there for a while, Keyes. You said it wasn't an accident. Check.
You said it wasn't an accident. Check. You said it wasn't suicide. Check.
- I'm crazy about you, Walter. That perfume on your hair. What's the name of it? I don't know.
Maybe he was a little better than he sounded. But right then it gave me a nasty feeling to be thinking about them at all... with that briefcase right behind my head that had her father's signature in it... and what that signature meant. It meant he was a dead pigeon.
But we can't wait. I can't go on like this. Look, we're not gonna grab a hammer and do it quick, just to get it over with. - There are other ways.
When your mother died? We were at Lake Arrowhead. That was six years ago. We had a cabin there.
X is equal to negative P half plus or minus the root of P half in square minus Q the tangent one half ( Alpha plus Beta )... If the cocoa is not sweet enough for you... It's fine, it's fine.
On one end it goes back and forth, and on the other end it goes around. That is the connecting rod. Sometimes this kind of steam engine has two cylinders.
Well, you sure put us in a spot, didn't you? - Me? It was your idea.
Goodbye. Come and see me if you're ever in London. My name is Thwaites, Miss Thwaites. I'll point out the window of the room in Number 9 where it happened.
- Yes. With the sun rising, lighting your hair as it is now. I don't know how it ends.
All her trunks are up there and all her costumes. Then we'll put all these there, too, and then we'll board it up... so you'll never have to see it again, never even think of it. That piano traveled with her everywhere in the great days.
How sweet of you to give me this. I'm afraid the pin is not very strong. - No.
Nancy, did you turn the gas up in there? Turn it up? No, why?
Turn it up? No, why? I thought it went down in here, as if you had.
- Why has it been taken down? - Why indeed? Why was it taken down before?
- Why indeed? Why was it taken down before? Get it from wherever you've hidden it and put it back in its place.
I swear I haven't. Why should I? Don't look at me like that.
We shouldn't have come tonight, but she was so anxious. I'm so sorry, Lady Dalroy. I think it's the most...
- Why, yes. Then it really happens. I thought I imagined it.
I know it. I know it. But he was here.
I saw him. You see how it is, Elizabeth? Yes, sir.
If I ever meant anything to you, and I believe I did... then help me, Paula. Give me another chance. Look, in the drawer of that cupboard there is a knife.
Be quick, Paula. Get me the knife. Cut me free. Would you get it, Paula?
Get me the knife. Cut me free. Would you get it, Paula? Would you get it for me?
Would you get it, Paula? Would you get it for me? Yes, I'll get it.
And I have lost it. - Paula... - I must look for it, mustn't I?
- Paula... - I must look for it, mustn't I? If I don't find it, you will put me in the madhouse.
- I must look for it, mustn't I? If I don't find it, you will put me in the madhouse. Where could it be, now?
If I don't find it, you will put me in the madhouse. Where could it be, now? Perhaps it's behind this picture.
Perhaps it's behind this picture. Yes, it must be here. No. Where shall I look now?
Look, you keep out of this, will you? Go on. This is between him and me. O'MALLEY: Honestly, I'm sorry about the window.
This is between him and me. O'MALLEY: Honestly, I'm sorry about the window. Yeah, but being sorry don't fix it.
It's all right. It's not charity. It's a loan. Thanks.
It's not charity. It's a loan. Thanks. I can use it.
Said they were loaded up. May I see it? - So you're still in trouble.
May I see it? - So you're still in trouble. - Wouldn't even look at it?
- You mean to talk business? The money? Don't let that embarrass you. We love it.
It doesn't say enough. It hasn't got that... Well, it's just not for me.
If I lose it, I'll swear off. I'll quit. Take 50 cents. No.
"A great number were taken prisoner and brought before the consul. What is this? Using prohibited aids, Mr Widgren?
I forgot to erase it. "Forgot to erase it"... But of course...
You see, I... Do you see that star? It seems to be hanging far below the sky on an invisible string.
- I want to help him. - You do love him. But he doesn't know it.
"She phoned and canceled our engagement at exactly 7:00." - After that I... - You "ate a lonely dinner," "then got into the tub to read." Why did you write it down?
Afraid you'd forget it? I am the most widely misquoted man in America. When my friends do it, I resent it.
As a matter of fact, I was just lying down here. My hotel room was so hot, and then all the people and reporters and telephone. You know how it is, Lieutenant.
Laura, take a look at this. Do you like it? Do you think it'll make people want to bathe more often? It should.
I believe you presented him with a cigarette case on his last birthday. Rather valuable, isn't it? Where did you get it?
You're being fantastic, McPherson. You took a bottle of Black Pony to her house Friday night. I took it there over a week ago.
Why did you tell me the radio at your country place was broken? - Because it was broken. - Not when I tried it.
Shelby was scared, so he ran out as fast as he could. Then Waldo came back and placed the gun in that clock. I knew it.
- I hope so. It's lovely. I've always admired mink.
They're nothing but H2O with a trace of sodium chloride. He likes you, but he hates the bracelet. You will have to get rid of it. - The bracelet? - Mm-hmm.
He likes you, but he hates the bracelet. You will have to get rid of it. - The bracelet? - Mm-hmm. I've worn it for 15 years.
- The bracelet? - Mm-hmm. I've worn it for 15 years. It's brought me nothing but good luck.
I've worn it for 15 years. It's brought me nothing but good luck. He hates it.
Perhaps countess Rubido will be offended because we did not attend that famous premiere of theirs, but as the president of the Musical Institute, I cannot afford to support dilettantism. I am surprised to see the countess engage in such a frivolous undertaking.
With the third act already completed, and having broadened his musical knowledge immensely during his stay in Prague, Lisinski returned to Zagreb full of hope. Gentlemen, please, just a few moments longer. We have come to the last item on our agenda.
You do like that tune, don't you? Oh, I love it. It's the Notre Dame victory song.
Stanley, we've got to uphold the rights of human beings. That beautiful sirloin steak is enough for at least four people. And he's hoarding it.
That beautiful sirloin steak is enough for at least four people. And he's hoarding it. Mrs. Hawkley needs it more than that lion.
Ladies first, I always say. Stanley. Get the meat. - You mean, me get the meat? - Of course.
It's working. Pretend you're a lady lion. All right.
- Look. - Look, the steak. Good boy, you got it.
- Look, the steak. Good boy, you got it. How'd you get it?
Stanley, a sharper knife, please. This one is very dull. The shortage of steel, you know.
Stanley, you wait here and I'll go and see if I can get a bed here for Chris. You seem awfully fond of that thing, Chris. I am. Knute Rockne gave it to my father.
You seem awfully fond of that thing, Chris. I am. Knute Rockne gave it to my father. Put it under the pillow till morning.
I ain't kidding. I give you my word. Will you do it?
- Are you sure this is the largest one? - Of course it is. I picked it out myself.
Leave it alone. And put that down. Now look what you've done.
Come, come, gentlemen, please. I'm a very sensitive man. I find this quite painful.
What luck? See for yourself. I stuffed it with paper to stop it from rattling.
Reach into the inside pocket of that coat that you're about to throw aside. What do you find there? Pocketbook.
Well, most of them but why? This Hogarth etching for instance, - is it connected? - Most certainly.
That's funny. I had it here a moment ago. Extraordinary thing.
Where can it be? I lifted it. Oh, what would Holmes do? I know, reconstruct the..
Look at that, Lestrade. That china was broken after her dead body was flung there on the floor? But why, why was it done?
Oh, look. Bird. Matter of fact I had thought of it myself. Oh, did you really?
This is where I nabbed him. He was beating it along here like a frightened rabbit when I come up from behind and made the pinch. That isn't true.
Here, here. What have you broken now? I never saw such a one for breakage. You aren't even worth half the wages you earn.
Page. Yes sir. Lord Penrose. La Morte Rouge is on the telephone.
I will recall a short story by that brilliant author G. K. Cheston in which the murder is committed by a postman I refer of course to the invisible man. A brilliant bit of deduction on the part of Father Brown. I'm a postman.
This is what's left of the De Port Hotel Mr. Holmes. Tanner sleeps here when he's in La Morte Rouge. Spooky old place.
Tanner sleeps here when he's in La Morte Rouge. Spooky old place. Villagers call it the Wolf House.
Why all this fuss about an old photograph? Watson have you ever stopped to think that the science of detection is very much like stringing a hand full of beads? I can't say that I have.
- I don't like him. - That's a pretty good reason. Besides, I need boat fare to get out of Martinique.
There was no money on him or in his wallet. Only some American traveler's checks. Was that customary with him?
Sure. So it goes. - That's about as far as it goes.
- I got a refund on that ticket. Here. That's gonna help a lot.
- Chloroform. Get over by his head. If he comes to while I'm probing... pour some of it on a hunk of cotton and give him a whiff of it.
- Goodbye. Just what is this, my dear? Well, it said coffee on the bag.
Jean. Let me put it to you this way, supposing you knew the saboteur? Supposing it was your brother or someone you loved?
Your records are old. Don't listen, then! You're rich now.
- Is your line ready? - I don't know... I think it'll be grand.
Listen. There are things I never told women. They thought I loved them, or not. But I never said it.
Hurry up! This isn't all fun and games! - Is it going well? - Yes.
- That's funny, neither did I. - Why, something happen? - Nicky, what is it?
Oh, Nick, here's the bullet. I don't know about such things, but I imagine it was fired from a.45 or something in that general field. - Well, give it to Mac.
Cut it out, will you? Come on. Give me the police department, please.
She was out cold. Somebody had conked her before I got here. - What about the painting? - It's gone.
Everybody wanted it. Draque offered 500. Mrs. Draque got it. She got conked.
Draque offered 500. Mrs. Draque got it. She got conked. Let's see, now, who else wanted it?
But your old man wasn't in the audience watching you. That's it, isn't it? Or part of it anyway.
I'll just make some cocoa to quiet their nerves. Cocoa? What a break.
- Sure, and it's probably trailing' us. There wouldn't be if she hadn't sicked it on us. Are you telling me that there pretty lady is a skunk?
When I'm done, I'm gonna throw it away. When I throw it away, take care of yourself. Some friend of this belly-bustin' gunman, I take it.
- Where's what? - The money. Stop stalling.
That's the way the law says it. If they've got a corpus, you're delict. Before this, we could have proved there was a mistake.
Come on? Try any monkey business and I'll blow you clear outta this house. Where's that money?
But I ain't gonna help you with it none. I'm gonna make you ask about it. All right.
No mortal cold, Sally. It's a cold from beyond the grave. What are you talking about?
What are you talking about? Believe it or not, this house is haunted. - I don't believe it.
- Thank you. Doctor, I'd hoped you'd be able to explain to me a happening which, to put it mildly, has always puzzled me. I shall try.
'They always seem to have everything they want.' - Oh, hello, darling. - Hello, sweet.
Take it through, will you? - What on earth's that? - Just a little birthday present.
What do you mean, "wrong"? Well, it wasn't my room I was seeing, it was some other room. - Darling! - I told you it sounded silly.
Well at first, if I made an enormous effort of will, the reflection used to change back to what it ought to be. But lately, however hard I try, it doesn't change anymore. The only thing to do is to try not to look in it at all.
I hope your husband was satisfied with it. Yes, very. - How odd you should mention it.
Sounds to me as though you're completely stumped this time. Joan saw the room in the mirror as well as Peter. The witness I couldn't supply you with.
Another pillar of salt. Ah, love! It cheers the heart. - Same old story? - Same old story!
Are you sure you don't want the second-floor flat? No, really, a small room is fine. What a shame!
We found the door open, so we came in. How did you get that cut? I bumped into a man carrying some baskets a little while ago.
Where could I have got this? - I'll throw it away. - No.
Well, I guess I could. Well, then you could... bring it over after a while. But I think it'd be awfully late, Netta.
It wouldn't matter how late, George. - Who is it? - It's I, George.
- Who is it? - It's I, George. I've just finished it.
- It's I, George. I've just finished it. You said to bring it over.
May I come in and play it to you? Well, it's... it's awfully late, George.
But you said it didn't matter how late. Well, darling, I've just been asleep. I'll just look at it.
Well, darling, I've just been asleep. I'll just look at it. But I've... I've worked awfully hard to finish it.
Thank you. Blimey, but it's hot. I'm watching out for a load of gas pipe.
She says he threw something round her neck. It was probably a cord with a knot in it. That's what caused the bruise.
It acted like a thuggee cord. Thuggee? What's that?
What's that? It's a method of very swift and silent murder. - But what could...
I won't do it. But I must have it, dear. - I open next week.
That's not the right tempo. Darling, it would be for my song! You can't have it.
You can't have it. It belongs to the concerto. Oh, George.
It belongs to the concerto. Oh, George. It's such a little thing.
Play it once. Waltz tempo. Go on.
Breathe aflame This is our moment For gay love
- Fifth of November. - Remember the fifth. - I'd forgotten it was Guy Fawkes Day.
Why haven't you told me about it before? - I tried to, George. - My dear fellow...
Mrs. Monteith had no opportunity to deliver the envelope. Yes of course, quite obvious. Where'd you find it?
I'm afraid, Mr. Holmes, if you don't go with the sergeant there's no way to get back to the village tonight. Oh but Mr. Holmes, there's no need for you to stay at the inn. It's such a dreary place.
He couldn't have got far. My men will soon apprehend him. You know this rather reminds me of a very similar account when I brought about the undoing of the notorious Professor Moriarty.
The most silent service of the United States in peace or war is the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Bureau went to war with Germany long before hostilities began. No word or picture could then make public the crucial war service of the FBI.
TECHNICIAN: There's something coming now. Yeah, it's in cipher. This stuff is fugitive.
I've got to put this in code. It'll take time. Orders are not to be questioned.
I was told to take it to a house on 92nd Street. -And who told you to take it there? -I don't know.
That's the one that was used to copy the data. Then Roper is the man who's been getting it out. -Shall we pick him up?
-Yes, I believe you can. LANGE: Are you looking for a particular book? Yes, but I can't find it.
Make sure that he sends it... ... becauseeverything depends on you getting that through. -He'll send it.
- Of course, if you don't like flattery-- - But I do. On second thought, it won't be flattery.
- You poor thing, you must be famished. Mrs. Robie told Emily to leave you a tray. Good.
- Ever hunted them? - No, I haven't. It's tricky shooting. They're sort of scary, but they're so big and clumsy, they hate to take wing.
You know what the doctor told you. Come here and sit down. What have you done with Father's lab?
Ellen! Shocked, aren't you? If you were having the baby, you'd love it.
Please come over at once. Something terrible has happened. Well, we couldn't save the child.
A little daylight's coming through, and you start to wonder. Is it getting lighter? Is it getting darker?
Is it getting darker? Is it dawn or is it dusk? That's a terrifying problem.
- The checks must've gotten mixed up. - Maybe they did. Find my coat.
You know you did. Where did you put it? You're not crazy. Where did you put it?
That's what started most of these guys off. Now, be a good boy and drink this. - I don't want it.
That's when you start seeing animals. You know that stuff about pink elephants? That's bunk.
I was the only one that really understood you. I knew there was a core of something. Well, there is.
All right. Now, go. No fuss, please. And don't call the neighbors.
About nightmares, horrors, humiliations... all the things I want to forget. Put it all down on paper. Get rid of it that way. Tell it all: "To whom it may concern."
How does that little tune go? Let me see, I'll think of it in a minute. Incorrigible.
All right, now, well, let's see. Did any of you ever hear of the Giant Rat of Sumatra? No, but it sounds terribly gruesome.
Oh, so he likes something you wrote? Listen, Pinkers, you're being paid To play Remick numbers, not your own. Do you mind? No, we don't want to publish it!
This one. What, again? Do you know it?
Yeah, it has bounce- A diminished ninth, too. Little unusual for popular music, isn't it? Oh, I guess it is, Mr. Dreyfus,
Hey, that's a good title. Not bad. Blue Monday Blues. Let's go down on the stage and run it through.
Ira is doing the lyrics. What a combination. Play Embraceable You.
But it isn't. You can make up songs, but you can't make up life. Please go on with your painting. All right.
And the last stop is heaven. Quit it, will you, Max? I thought you'd finished your portrait.
With daddy and mammy Most of the audience loved it. What did the critics say? Some of them said it wasn't opera.
Most of the audience loved it. What did the critics say? Some of them said it wasn't opera. Why wasn't it opera? Just because ordinary people liked it?
Sure, but there's only one I want. Yeah, and he's making a tramp out of you. You wouldn't know love if it hit you in the face!
Are you blind? No. Didn't you... didn't you like the radio?
I thought I heard the doorbell. I didn't hear anything. Say, is this all you've got?
I'm sorry you have to go... Bye-bye, Dear. - Don't forget the money!
I tell you the old boy's a phony. His money isn't phony, is it? He could borrow dough, or have it stashed away...
- Chris steal? Jeepers, Johnny, he's not the type. He wouldn't have nerve enough to steal!
The insurance? 2000 dollars... on your life. Adele collected it.
2000 dollars... on your life. Adele collected it. It's really yours, isn't it?
Adele collected it. It's really yours, isn't it? She keeps it right in her bedroom.
It's really yours, isn't it? She keeps it right in her bedroom. Now I wouldn't touch a penny of it, Mr. Higgins, but... if you took it, it would be perfectly legal.
What if she don't go out... and I show up... Your goose is cooked, isn't it? Yes, but...
It's got your initials on it, but it's her blood. Here's 140 dollars that was taken out of her pocketbook. That was mine.
I'm a citizen, I got my rights! This belongs to you too, huh? It's got your fingerprints on it.
Because something has happened to us. But it doesn't happen like that, in a day. It happens in a moment sometimes.
It strikes rarely. I don't understand how it happened. - What is it?
There's a lot more to it. Go on and try to recall the details. The more cockeyed, the better for the scientific side of it.
We can call a travel agency and check all the resort names. It wasn't Angel Valley. I remember it.

What do you mean? Say, look, I usually charge for unpleasant work like this. - Oh, I get it, I get it.
Very much so. Well, that's also unfortunate. I wanted a couple. Something in the nature of superior caretakers for this place which I intend to offer for sale furnished as it is. I'm sure I could show it off to the best possible advantage, ma'am.
Yes, that's it. I got to thinking maybe you're right. It is stupid of me.
I got to thinking maybe you're right. It is stupid of me. It is selfish.
Be kind of a pretty name. Don't think I didn't think of that. How's it feel?
How's it feel? - How's it feel? - Feels fine.
- How's it feel? - Feels fine. How's it look?
Let's try the oxygen valve. Doorbell. - Anna's gone out.
Often? Does it really happen to you often? Well, not anymore so than is good for me.
Hey, what's that? Oh, this is a little invention of mine. Hello, Diz.
That window in the empty house across the street, first floor front. Oh, what's wrong with it? It's open.
Oh, what's wrong with it? It's open. Why shouldn't it be open?
Strange, isn't it, how the light is reflected. Little specks of light that move and move. It's restful here. It's peaceful.
Let's walk a little, Mr. Holmes. It's so pleasant here in the garden. Just step up here onto the terrace.
It seems like we'll never get out of this hell. It'll be over, Pina, and spring will come back, and it'll be even more beautiful because we'll be free. We have to believe in it.
- And it still hurts? - Not for some time. But to be sure, you always carry it.
But to be sure, you always carry it. I wanted to return it to the dentist. That explains it.
Burn that face, that picture, into your memory... because the success of your mission, and subsequently... the destruction of the target, is linked to that man. - Duclois. - Duclois. - Duclois. - Well, what is his connection with the bomb depot?
I have a good heart, but i am a monster. There are men far more monstrous than you, though they conceal it well. Besides being hideous, i'm not quick-witted.
Look over there, belle. Do you see that pavilion? It's called diana's pavilion.
It's belle! - Belle? Impossible.
Someone I love very much. Alex, I implore you, don't take it like this. But I can't help it. How else could I say it?

What's it mean, Holmes? You on to something? Perhaps. I don't know yet.
Presumably, these are the first and second portions of the message. And this gang has the first and third parts of it. - Precisely.
My wife isn't just a "woman". - I could've made a mistake. - You did. Don't make it again.

You're making it very difficult for me. I'm sorry, darling. I wouldn't if I could help it.
They advised me not to play cards with you because you cheat. - Do you think it's true? - Yes.
Sophie. - Yes? - I saw the most divine wedding dress at Molyneux's.
- Yesterday at the Ritz was tough going. - I know, I saw it. Did you?
Did you? Did I show it? Only to me, I think.
Vanished unseasonably at shut of eve My advice is that you go and have a good dinner. I have a card here of one of the best restaurants in Toulon.
It's only a temporary indisposition. I'm lunching with a duke on Sunday and I've told my doctor he must put me to rights by then at all costs. It's too bad this should have happened just now.
You know you love me. You know that you've always wanted me. Say it's true.
- Maybe you oughta ask there about your pal. - What time's it open? How do I know?
That was some drop- two million bucks. How's a thing like that happen? Well, it's a long story. Don't ask for details, but here's most of it.
And then before he could come over after it... he got knocked off by one of the fellow members of the lodge. And here was this big chunk of dough floating'around loose in this country... like a pair of dice at a firemen's ball. It moved east to west.
It moved east to west. Each time it moved, it left a stiff behind it with his fingers stretched out. The boys play rough for that kind of lettuce, you understand.
I got a note that said Larry Cravat was at 42111/2 Summit. - I don't get it. - From whom was the note?
What kind of trouble is Taylor in? It won't make any difference to me. Maybe it will.
Michael Conroy. My daughter, she'll worry. Will someone- Her name is Elizabeth.
My back - Now my back's beginning to hurt. Conroy, the other night, a couple of nights ago, maybe... a man was murdered on the dock. - You saw it. - Yes. I saw it.
Conroy, the other night, a couple of nights ago, maybe... a man was murdered on the dock. - You saw it. - Yes. I saw it. Do you remember who did it?
- It could be. I don't know for sure. After all, I only met him once. I'm Larry Cravat. You can take my word for it. - I do.
- What about Christy? - She goes too. - You won't get the money! Yes, I will.
- She goes too. - You won't get the money! Yes, I will. I know where it is now.
Bring them right in there, Mr Peabody. What does the law say about this kind of murder? is it the same as killing a man?
Charles. Listen. it's striking. After 100 years.
- Mr Potter asked me to deliver this. - Good. Sara's waiting for it.
No sir. Was the key ever out of your possession? It never is, sir.
Might even be an accomplice. Oh well if I were a policeman I'd take you and charge this very moment. I didn't do it sir.
He's got Johnny. You are lucky. You get the cell with the gramophone. It belonged to barry, Him who chopped off his uncle's head. Oh.
Please don't do that. You know, it gets on the prisoners' nerves. I imagine it would. It's very simple. I'll show you.
I must have it! Make her give it to me, Mr. West. Make her give it to me now! Or it will be too late!
I'll get your money. It's a 500? Yes, I just sold it.
It's a 500? Yes, I just sold it. It's a great machine.
The Ace of Clubs. Is this one any good? I don't know. Take it.
I don't know. Take it. It helps me pass the time. I don't want to take it out now.
139 800. Block it. Say you lost it. Then no one else can use it.
But I'm not buying any pipe dreams. It can be done. It's been done before, and it'll be done again.
Oh, Tom, darling. Here, put it on. It's beautiful.
At "H" hour, we attacked uphill. The Krauts turned all their guns to stop us. That was exactly when the other gang attacked from behind.
The plan's a flop. You're on your own. It's a million-to-one. He's trying to ram the gates!
Tell me about the Indies, señor. That word sets your imagination on fire, doesn't it? Well, why not?
- Girl. Have the boy bring my animal too. - Sí, señor. And, uh, here. - This'll fetch you a new dress. But it's gold.
- Oh, no, no. - Take it back! - No. Keep it till tomorrow.
That's odd. This has been filed. The Indians have no steel.
Far from it. It has to be timed to the very split of a second. Had I removed the iron too soon, the wound would not have seared.
If we fail, it doesn't matter, as history will forget us. Sir, this is not an attack. It's a peaceful mission.
Sir, this is not an attack. It's a peaceful mission. - How do you know, de Vargas? Maybe it's a trick.
- The cops may be on their way right now! - I can't travel with this face. It's plastered all over the papers.
- That costs money. - I've got plenty. A girl named Irene Jansen gave it to me.
- Have you got the money? - Yeah, you want it now? Sam said you could afford $200.
Now, just close your eyes. I've got a fine anesthetic. Used it in the last war.
It's time for the bandages to come off. I know it's awfully early... but you said you wanted to get away before it got light. How does your face feel?
Don't let it give you any ideas. - What kind? - Don't change yours.
If you want to walk away from here, tell me if it's the same car I think it was. I haven't got a thing to lose. Not a thing.
That's no evidence. That's just the way you figure it. That's why you're after a confession, isn't it?
Sure. You forget everything. I was up for the Navy cross.
Well, well. - I was wondering if you'd mind talking about it. - Not at all. Not at all.
Better you put that coat on, liebling. Coat? Thank you, I'm not cold.
Mine. - Nothing can change that. - Never mind that nonsense. How did you find out about me and the escape and the rest of it?
- Let them. And if they searched me, would they ever suspect this, uh... piece of money? - Let me keep it.
Here we stand under your beautiful old plane-tree by this small avenue which branches off from my street and leads only to you. It's early morning, it's cold, and we're reaching a decision. And it all seems as if it were meant to be so.
This morning I said no. Then perhaps it was a happy day, if a bit different. No! Don't scratch it out.
It's not a pleasure trip. Quite the contrary. And this time it'll be a hard-fought battle.
That's all people need to know. Don't act dumb. Everyone knows it's been signed over to me.
- No. No water. - Is that dangerous?
Well? I can't keep it in my head. Illingenworth!
I can't keep it in my head. Illingenworth! May I write it down?
I published it in November 1940. Yes. 1940... That took some courage back then, to risk yourself in such an adventure.
Good thing we haven't any servants. It's perfectly safe tonight. Should have been left where it was.
Peter, don't pull the cat's tail. You have a cruel streak. Where do you get it? I'm only playing with him.
Then this happens and you want to believe all over again. This is a ruthless world and one must be ruthless to cope with it. That isn't true.
- Why, of course. - We can go to the lawyer's now. - Today?
How much cattle range do you control? I've heard it runs into a million or more acres. I've never counted them.
To me, it's land the way god made it And wants it to stay. And I may be wrong but I've got a hunch That he wants me to help him keep it that way.
And wants it to stay. And I may be wrong but I've got a hunch That he wants me to help him keep it that way. I know it's too soon to expect you to see it that way, lutie
And I may be wrong but I've got a hunch That he wants me to help him keep it that way. I know it's too soon to expect you to see it that way, lutie But you will see it some day.
I'm awfully glad she doesn't seem lonely. Did you expect her to be? Well, this is the place for it. Hardly a woman'country. It could be.
It figured to happen. This tough country, lutie. This country, I'm sick to death Of talking about this country. You really think it's more important
And men like chamberlain, they want to farm it. They want to dig it up and draw the water out of its veins, Let the sun get at it, way down deep. It would curl up and die then, lutie, It would be dead, and so would the whole country, It would never live again.
- No. I haven't gotten to it yet. But, I do know that...
You're right. It's an oldie. A very old oldie.
How did that dinghy get there? Not very neat of the inspector, was it? What's the excitement, boy?
What's the excitement, boy? It's just a razorblade. Oh, no.
There it is. Thanks. If it was any bigger, it'd bite you.
At the Charity Ball? Remember, when you dropped your necklace? Yes.
Yes. Why aren't you wearing it? You're wearing the earrings.
Live a little, Ziggy. Live a little, man. My body needs lifting.
I don't feel it. That's it. Yeah.
We'll join you as soon as we finish. - Who gets the bone? - I do.
- Eve's Fifth Avenue, I think. - I mean, is it yours? - I only steal cocktail napkins.
- I don't like it. - Sorry, but that's the way it's got to be. - She isn't.
- Sorry, but that's the way it's got to be. - She isn't. - And Mrs. Talbin is wearing it.
I'm very interested in murders. Forgive me if I seem inquisitive, but where'd it happen? -At Murcia.
-At Murcia. -How'd you do it? Now, let me guess.
-How'd you do it? Now, let me guess. You did it with your hands, didn't you?
You just killed him for the fun of it? He was a Franco spy. There was a war on at the time.
Before you write that novel, you'd better learn something. You've been travelling the world too much to find out about it. That's good, Arthur.
He talked about suicide. I've thought of that sometimes. Suicide?
Everything's bad, Michael. Everything. You can't escape it or fight it.
Is that foolish enough for you? My husband wrote that thing and got you to sign it for him. It's one of those famous Bannister tricks.
And you have reason to believe that Michael is innocent? I hear that Galloway is going to say that Michael took George's corpse into the city in our speedboat. -We can prove he didn't.
-We can prove he didn't. -George couldn't have taken it. -Why not?
-Back where? -To the yacht, naturally. The speedboat couldn't have driven itself.
Tonight I'm showing my face and I'm talking, this is superb! Tell me about your adventure. Take this.
- Don't tempt me! - In a few seconds it'll be too late... Alright, kill me!
You seem tired. Sit down. Next to me. This resemblance might be useful to us. If we disapproved of it, it might create a scandal.
- Look at my neck. This morning my medallion seemed to strangle me. Death who imprisons me, shouted to me "So you want to live, girl?
Nature went mad that day, Boris. You have not been around since you sent me this Joan Madou. Why? What is the matter with her?
Oh, what's the use? What is it? Why is it that way with us?
It was my fault, Joan. No. It was...
I don't know, Your Majesty. I want my stag! It must be a band marching down the highway.
If I might be excused, Your Majesty. What is it? What's happening? She's run away.
Powdered egg omelette, probably, and a little Spam. - Can I carry that for you? - No, thank you.
That used to be the largest department store in Berlin. It was 12 storeys high. Later on it became headquarters for the storm troopers.
They had their first free election in 14 years. It had been so long they didn't know what to do. It was like handing the village drunk a glass of water.
Those aren't teardrops. I was washing my hands when he asked me to give it to you. All right, I'll put it right there.
Tell me what you make of this. Well it's better than no whiskey at all, sir. - Strike a match.
But as a noncommissioned officer, you are aware of the barrier between your class and mine. - I am, sir. But Michael's an officer. Not that it makes any difference.
Aye, madam, it is common. If it be, why seems it so particular with thee? Seems, madam?
- Did you not speak to it? - My lord, I did, but answer made it none. Yet once methought it lifted up its head as it would speak.
- I would I had been there. - It would have much amazed you. Very like. Very like.
This skull hath lain in the earth three and twenty year. - Whose was it? - A whoreson mad fellow's it was.
Hurry up, Bruno. It's almost 6:30. I can't clean it good because it's still dark. Daddy, did you see what they've done?
I can't clean it good because it's still dark. Daddy, did you see what they've done? It's dented.
Excuse me. This man here stole your bicycle? Yes, and I want it back.
Yes? - I did. Haven't I repeatedly told you not to cut up the paper until I've read it? I'm sorry, Father.
You understand, Mr. Smith, we're just window-shopping. Oh, perfectly all right. Not a bad-looking house.
You buy it with your heart, not your head. You don't ask, "How much was the paint? The canvas?" You look at it.
You don't ask, "How much was the paint? The canvas?" You look at it. And you say, "It's beautiful. I want it."
If a lilac can live and be so old, so can the house. It just needs someone to love it, that's all. It's good there are two of you.
This isn't a train. I just saw it move. It's stood since the second year of the Continental Congress.
Any small changes would have to conform to the character of the countryside. And still be functional. What is your professional opinion?
For $ 1300, they can live in a house with three bathrooms and rough it. - Why, Bill! - Hello, Muriel.
I think I'd better have a little talk with Mr. Tesander. - Yep? - How's it coming?
I know all about it. Its succulent goodness. - Its sugar-smoked tenderness.
A little warmer, but still, not to suggest any other color but white. Now, for the powder room in here, I want you to match this thread. And don't lose it.
Now, for the powder room in here, I want you to match this thread. And don't lose it. It's the only spool I have and I had an awful time finding it.
Twelve dollars and thirty-six cents. Why be a piker, Mr. Tesander? Here, take everything I've got.
Is it true? - You're not gonna use it? - Certainly. Take it on, Gumbo.
- You're not gonna use it? - Certainly. Take it on, Gumbo. Oh, it's like a graveyard out there.
Excellency, I await your permission. No. No.
- We'll talk about that later. - I don't see any "M" on that brand. I'll put an "M" on it when you earn it. That's fair enough.
I'm sorry for you-- How about you? You want some of it?
Right there. It's all right, Buster. It's me, Matt.
- I didn't hear nothing. I heard it. It was nothing I ever heard before. Hey, they're yelling down on the point.
- Yes. - Good. You better put those away in my chequebook drawer behind the box. Now...
It's a museum piece now. We really should preserve it for posterity, except, it's such good crystal and I'd hate to break up the set. Out of this, David Kentley had his last drink.
And the lock's too old. It won't work. I wish it would. I wish we had him out of here. I wish it were somebody else.
- Why? - Why? Yes, why?
With all these lights on? Answer it, Phillip. Who is it?
- Gonna leave the car here? - Sure, it's okay. Some shack, eh?
Well, thought maybe I could fix you up with a car. Maybe. Party I know took in a new convertible today. How long will it take?
We got a lot of blankets. It gets kind of chilly up here. It freezes, but it never snows.
He'll find it. Bowie... I'm gonna have our baby.
You see, I have a similar appointment in an hour. That is, if I survive this one. No, just as you say.
I don't understand you. That's a very beautiful ring. Yes.
My terms are simple. First, there is a certain estate in the vicinity of Lille, a barony. It was renounced by its owner quite some years ago.
Richelieu gave you a certain paper, a carte blanche. Since I cannot kill you, I must at least have that paper. No.
Okay, you guys, get aboard. Take it your way. What's the matter with you two?
That's exactly what I say. Gold don't carry any curse with it. It all depends on whether or not the guy who finds it is the right guy.
What else could it be? Only gold shines and glitters like that. We've struck it, Curt.
It's just like plain sand. It don't glitter. I thought it would. It will when it's refined by some other guy.
Open the sluice gate. How much do you figure it to be now? About $5,000 worth, I reckon.
Brace yourself. I'm gonna kick you in the teeth. You won't like it right at first.
- Gold! Well, where'd you get it? - Off our claim.
Do not write that much. You are very good. married up. -With the French?
We'd be very grateful if you'd tell us what all this means. It means that the prophecy of the two birds... of the fairest color has been fulfilled. It is a very old one.
If ever there was a place to stash away a limping car with a hot license number. There was another occupant in that garage, an enormous, foreign-built automobile. It must have burned up ten gallons to a mile.
Yes, sir. And that kid out there he had a perfect ear for it. He could hear it, and he could feel it.
For that foul-smelling rabble. It's so hot today. This heat of Rome oppresses me.
I know. But if I took any notice, how insulting it would be. If I hadn't come back, I doubt you would have lasted the year out. Think of this, a sword is like a bird.
Remember, I'm not in the same league with you, financially. Take my car. If I'm wrong, it's yours.
Your cocoa is nearly ready. Ten o'clock! Oh, darling, this is a surprise! I made it myself from a new recipe.
- Yes. I think you'll find pressure all around our defences. However, it seems to me that this hill, Ed Duda, is a key position.
- Since what happened? - Every evening of the voyage, a star appeared above the bow, standing bright and steady in the sky, as if sent to guide the ship home. In my illness, I thought you had sent it as a sign.
Well, have you? - Yeah, I got a plan. - Well?
It was a stroll through a thousand memories. The post box is still there. - It'll outlive us.
- What do you mean? At times I think this music is a monstrosity. My friend BüIow believes it could send a person mad.
- All right, Steve. Science is science, but a girl must get her hair done. You'd better hurry though, if you're going to catch that bus.
- We are honoured, monsieur. May I compliment you once again on this most beautiful palace? There is no other like it in all of Europe.
Oh, to be a painter! What a beautiful turkey. Where'd you get it?
Oh, wait a minute. I thought you said this machine can't evaluate. Can't. Can't.
And if it won't speak to me, it won't speak to anyone. A magazine must be like a human being. If it comes into the home it must contribute.
Deep, Marion. Profound, Marion. You have come across this statue.
Each one having to do with its feedback system. The thing's forebrain. Now it's achieved true thought. True personality.
It lives. Life, consciousness, a machine? An intellect enormously more powerful and efficient even than yours, professor.
No, thank you, Papa. Ariane, is this yours? - Yes, Papa.
Take cover! Here. There's a mine shaft at the end of these cables.
I'll guarantee you of that. See that cockroach? Tomorrow morning, we'll be dead and it'll be alive.
Once before we went like this to Yagodnoye. Only our bundle was bigger and we were younger. Why do you carry your rifle?
It's bit bulky though. It's more suitable for a glove compartment. In any case, it's pretty impressive.
Well, how'd you come to lock yourself in? I was working last night and I jammed the key in the lock and then I turned it and broke it off. You can find it down there under the lock, I think, on the floor.
- I exaggerate, and you know it. But Anne's way of living is better than ours, and I have to face it. Good, then face it.
I thank you for this... For this great gift. I can't... I can't... Jen-ai, accept my gift.
I'm just about ready. All I've gotta do is find my lipstick. Where did I put it?
This is not uncommon. For example, in combat, some of the more remarkable heroics take place in this state of mind. Is there another name for this state we might be more likely to recognise?
- I see. I think you'll find a candle burning near the window in that room. Do kindly extinguish it.
- For how long? It could be some time. Then I have to remove the detonator.
The Tingler? Why not? Since we don't know what it is yet, we can't give it a Latin name. Tingler.
First, I'm going to put The Tingler back where it came from. So that if it can die, it will. And then I'll call the police.
I think it's the ignition. Must've gone out when I went through that fence. How sad.
Love! Not the carnal love, but the divine love. And where does this great love come from?
Do you recognize this baton? - Yes! - You should!
Your beneficence. This ? .... This gross piece to be worn on the altar of Chemosh? It's heavy and dead.
This ? .... This gross piece to be worn on the altar of Chemosh? It's heavy and dead. It lacks luster.
The cloud again. The dark cloud. It covers everything.
The dark cloud. It covers everything. It's stronger than I am.

There is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man. It is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity.
No, that hope is now fruitless. Gone is the fear of losing that bond, that confinement, that falsehood. That entire story is now over.
- Did you like it there otherwise? I was homesick. But I wasn't coming home until I'd finished the novel.
Your next stop, the twilight zone. This road is the afterwards of the civil war. It began at fort sumter, south carolina, and ended at a place called appomattox.
I was given a pearl necklace. You could pawn it. Thank you.
As miserable a hovel as this is, your landlord will be inconvenienced if you do not return. And without someone to retrieve your remains, your soul will wander aimlessly. I suggest you leave a note.
- It sure would. We have this major who makes us stand reveille every morning, rain or shine, which gives you an idea... If we kept it on the move, it'd sound like a lot of jeeps.
The misdeeds of our elders keep us fed today. I sit there all night, betraying the Republic of Venice. You see, I am writing a novel instead of doing historical research.
I was cleaning the cage. The bird got out. But where is it now?
Where did the angel fiind the crown? I trust God. I don't know where. Did the crown smell good?
Is this your gun? - Yes. I thought so.
Yes, he will. I promise you he will. Your tongue is old but sharp, Cicero.
Then let Caesar destroy Rome. Antony has just come from a meeting of my friends with good news. Tomorrow at the Senate, Lucius Cotta will move that I be made king.
It will pass. But I don't understand. King and emperor.
Which was at Actium, in Greece. Action begins with the rise of the sun. Your plan is brave and simple.
Be happy." My letter? Throw it away.
Don't let me go! Theo, stay with me! You won't believe this, but five minutes ago I left this door open... so you could find your way.
Over there! This island is a ship's graveyard. Maybe it's the current.
Pardon. They told me you had a letter. It's from him?
Upstairs? What's with the door? It won't open.
It won't open. - Is it locked? - It can't be.
Yes, sir. Loud and clear! They've got to know we're on the level!
Once the population, including the military, has been immobilized, my task force, which Mr. Strap had his people smuggle across the Rio Grande from Mexico, will approach Fort Knox in motorized equipment along Bullion Boulevard which runs past the depository here, and intersects with Gold Vault Road. This fence surrounding the depository, as Mr. Strap reminded us, is electrified.
The mask won't come off! Why won't it come off? Why won't it come off?
A glorious age. Gracious, leisurely, orderly. A time for many things. A machine was a thing ofjoy then, built to last a man's lifetime.
We have to start from scratch. The only information we have concerns the organization's structure. Let's start from there.
I'm staying here. No. You're going. I have to send you off to your flea- bitten war.
What does that matter? You could touch an H bomb and say, "l know what's in there, uranium and stuff... that is all."
and somebody's got to do a check. - Was the letter anonymous? - Yes.
Are there? - Have they opened his suicide letter? - They're photostatting the original.
I mean, just having met like this. Of course, it would be different if you cared for me. Do you want me to manufacture a lie?
You think it's more of a young person's art. I think so too. Let me tell you something. I have been thinking a lot... I've written a film that I never made.
The Spider was here. I told you I was here. And I know how to cross the River.
- Don't know who I am? - It doesn't matter. What matters is the flower.
After destroying lnawashiro Dam, Guilala is now heading for the Pacific coast. Commander, it's from FAFC. What?
It destroyed the Atomic Research Center and power plant? It absorbed all the atomic energy and is stronger than ever? It's turned into a ball of energy, bouncing from place to place.
You've got it. You think this Companion can do anything. I said it was very powerful.
You've tried heat... radiation... What other qualities or properties does the sun have? It exists physically.
What other qualities or properties does the sun have? It exists physically. It occupies space.
It exists physically. It occupies space. It has mass, therefore gravity.
- Mr Spock? - Unable to locate the radiation. Why not? You spotted it from the Enterprise.
So it is to sterilise. And for "sterilise" read "kill". And it has the power and the sophistication to do it.
And for "sterilise" read "kill". And it has the power and the sophistication to do it. It's powerful, it's sophisticated, but it's not infallible.
And... now. I've seen old photographs of this period. An economic upheaval had occurred.
The creature must still be around. Captain. What is it?
I envy you. You have a marvellous garden, Makino. I'm glad you like it, my Lord.
After all, what have you got to lose? You can always fall back on the firing squad. Klink, I have just come from that mine.
But what I can I do? Sir John isn't here. - In any case you've got to do something! The hypo that I gave him should last for about one hour.
We don't believe in going on a mission totally blindfolded, Mr. Jones. The film came out of a camera... - mounted in a Russian satellite.
But it writes black. Deceiving appearances... It's a very common pencil.
Deceiving appearances... It's a very common pencil. It has a point like a pencil.
I would like to see the computer in action once more, please. I don't see why not. Turn it on.
- Webster killed George Corley for a piece of jewellery worth $10 million. What, this crown thing? This crown thing was worn by the Empress Theodora in the fifth century.
What, this crown thing? This crown thing was worn by the Empress Theodora in the fifth century. Six months ago, it was stolen from the Athens state museum by George Corley.
They had them both. And the word is spreading only now. A philosophy of total love and total brotherhood.
- I've got bad news, captain. The entire dilithium-crystal-converter assembly is fused. No chance of repair.
If nobody claims it, you can keep it. Now get out. Wait a minute. Where did you find this parachute?
It'll mimic all the symptoms of Beck's bacteria. What about the pill? I'll attach it to the seat of the chair.
Look, my lad, I've had just about enough of this. That parrot is definitely deceased. And when I bought it not half an hour ago you assured me that its lack of movement was due to it being tired and shagged out after a long squawk.

This wall is non-load bearing, so we can rip it out. And the safest, quickest way, is using a claw hammer. And to handle our debris, we'll be using this trash chute.

What makes you think I'm not? I should go. For physics, Montinoff is having me write this essay - the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.
My friend has been in bed for 6 weeks... In the tank, a lobster eats itself slowly from the inside. You have to weigh it when you buy it.

What? But it's just a little cartoon pirate! Was.
My Vombrator... is this! A 100% French tractor! Those English pieces of junk don't even have a patch on it. Sadly, it's given up the ghost.
Oh no... Oh yes. A rugby team... is like the Foreign Legion.
- Was it on TV? - No, no, no... Not here.
From the couch, I'm guessing, since he was stoned. So the bullet should be here. 9 millimeter.
You don't need a justification to kill. The code is more than that. It's kept me from getting caught.
If you weren't around... I spent so much money on you! I could've sold this shack...
I spent so much money on you! I could've sold this shack... It's Mom's.
Have we a problem? Come on! The worm!
Gateway computer. I haven't seen one of these in a while. Still works great.
Right. If you're still sitting in the box, then you will be serving on this jury. Now, I can see this trial going one of two ways.
Melody said you weren't in school and now I know why. - John: It's a gift, Regina. - Oh, this is going back.
I'm not going to be bullied by an ambulance chaser, no matter how nice the suit. It is nice, isn't it? Italian.
I forgive you. You do? So that means you're willing to give me another shot?
-Shut up. -Really. This ring is pretty amazing.
Your humanity is killing you. Turn it off. No!
It is, and all you have to do is sign on the dotted line. What a lovely quill! Wherever did you get it?
It's a movie? Okay, okay, so there's this guy in a wheelchair, and he goes to this alien planet to join a program... So you pick a dragon and get to keep it forever?
I think he might be one of your patients. I don't know, should I call the cops? No. Just... just keep the door closed.
Maybe I wasn't clear before. When I said I had Michael, I meant it. Right now, a predator drone is circling the compound.
We don't have any A.C. at home. I have an A.C. you girls can use. You have an air conditioner that works?
We've been tracking a computer super virus named the "Omen." Bring it back to me, Mr. Casey goes free. The virus is too dangerous to be released into the world!
Well, you're on a new path now. Oh, goody, a new path. Is it lined with credit cards and flat screen TVs?
I couldn't save you. You were the one, who saved me. My body...
We're gonna have to clamp the vascular supply proximally. There's too much blood. I need you to clear the field. Damn it.
Come on. Take the probe. Hold it still.
It draws those things to it. The force here in this house is larger than the many individual traumas. And it has a need.
The force here in this house is larger than the many individual traumas. And it has a need. It wants to break through.
And it has a need. It wants to break through. It wants to move in our world.
They call it the Room of Tears, named for the sublime mixture of joy and sorrow that he must contemplate at this moment. He is brought a key to this box. It has been said that this box contains the ultimate secret.
Gun, knife, beaten to death? We're still trying to determine that. Well, you can't tell by looking at hi we wanna see the body.
- Very nice. You'd think the laundry room would be closer to the dorms. It's not in the basement?
This is how I get to put Greendale on the map. You know, I thought this commercial was going to be okay. Well, guess what?
You shouldn't laugh. It's no laughing matter. But there's no need for you to take it all as a tragedy. This place is unbelievable.
Anti-inflammatories. We needed the data on that box. You shouldn't have destroyed it.
I have a favor to ask you. The past is a tricky thing. Sometimes it's etched in stone.
Daddy,I can't live with her anymore. It's okay. this seat taken?
I have the advantage over my adversaries in that I know what cards they hold whereas they are oblivious to my hand. Do you see this spider's web? Big, isn't it?
If you're a communist, join the Viet Minh. There are men there who fight hard for a bad cause. But if you're a patriot, fight for your country. This war is your war.
You're my only friend, Margeir. Won't you put a candle on it? Of course.
Neither the light of the sun nor the shining night stars ease my bleeding heart. How many times has the crescent moon become the full moon. But you are still not here. The marble balcony is cold.
How many times has the crescent moon become the full moon. But you are still not here. The marble balcony is cold. It is dark.
You are beautiful, my Sultan. You dazzle my eyes. Is the table ready?
What do you think, Lady B? This baby is fully equipped. Equipped for what?
He's got me confused with someone else. What is this peculiar liquid? There's no bouquet.
No. Our world is not more transparent now. It's more opaque.
And go where? Anywhere my hands won't be used to make tools that kill anyone. This place is not so bad.
A tiger with wings? Exactly. This is a tiger, who's fierce and sleek. But it's got wings, so it flies above the neighborhood.
No! You told me to! Look at my neck!
Reminds me of one that belonged to my mother. It can't be the same one because her pearls are in this safe the manufacturer clearly explained is uncrackable. Oops.
The rarest Winslow Homer the world has yet to see. I have it at home in storage. I came across it under the most unusual circumstances.
Give Dad a kiss? Okay. My cactus. It's dead. So we'll return it.
And I was scared. But then, then I saw the moon. It was so big and it was so bright.
But then, then I saw the moon. It was so big and it was so bright. It seemed to chase the darkness away.
Well, the Thneed sure comes in handy for that! But wait, there's more! Thanks to its all-natural microfibers, the Thneed is super-absorbent!
I'm Camilla. Noel. So what sort of a business did your mum have then, Noel?
Only a stem can turn someone. Is that the sweater Tepish knit you? Mm-hmm. It would be impolite not to wear it.
It carried it off to a corner to eat it in peace. I followed it. But the cat turned on me.
One last thing. You will let me build a round nuclear weapon. Never.
We are just days away from testing the new missiles. I have re-engineered the oxidizing ducts and the payload delivery systems. But you'll be happy to know, the missile is now pointy!
No! Thank you, Scott. Your donation was more than generous.
And I don't even have a uterus. I mean, I have it. It's in a jar.
The Soy Sauce chooses you. The Soy Sauce chooses you. If it can't use you, it kills you.
Do you have my ring? Well, may I have it? Pretty.
Oh, my God. There was a bone. A forearm, I think. Maybe it was a shin.
How do I eject? Why do you have flames on your laptop? It's a gaming laptop.
I didn't wanna listen to him at first, but I see what he means now. You're turning evil. There is nothing evil about wanting more. There's nothing evil about that teapot.
According to witnesses, I can find Barberis... Not bad for an office guy, huh? Sorry, not just the head works...
You need to go. You've already complicated things enough by being here. This whole thing was supposed to go off without a hitch.
The fever returns? It never leaves us, Catherina Sforza. But the smell of battle will be its own medicine.
The movie, the wine, no coasters. And this pizza is incredible. It's frozen from the Dixie Stop.
Local P.D.'s trying to bury the story and the body. Okay, um, so, uh, what's up with the body? Well, when it went missing, it was a perfectly normal grad student named Charles Durbin.
Now, give up the free will. I should have destroyed it, but I was too damn proud of myself. So I kept it around, never letting it out of my sight.
Ashley... What could be wrong with this idea? It assumes we're the end. Yes.
Let me guess. The missing control unit. I had this happen! I had this happen once with a garage door opener.
The aliens. Has anyone ever seen the sky like that? No.
Your hands are much more sensitive than mine thanks to your condition, so I'm more than willing to leave this to you. To see an old affliction become a cure, and your tender care for her, how can I not be moved? Ji Ben, let me see your tongue.
I cannot be a man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving. By this hand, I love thee.
Well, you're fortunate you have someone that loves you. I really am. Love, it's like a delicate flame.
This is your team. These are your brothers. Everyone, grab an ax.
And I have a way for us to both get what we want. My hat. I want you to use it again.
Voilá. What, honey? I can't find my tiger! Where'd you put it?
- A dead-drop. - The SUV was registered to the wife of a Turkish oil executive that paid for plane tickets used by an Iranian suspect in the bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires in 1994. The thinnest thread connects Kurzweil and his contact and the machine could see it.
- The SUV was registered to the wife of a Turkish oil executive that paid for plane tickets used by an Iranian suspect in the bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires in 1994. The thinnest thread connects Kurzweil and his contact and the machine could see it. It knew. And it was right.
You can't even handle a donkey! I wanted it to run faster, so I smacked its butt. But it was startled.
Your fish. You're getting rid of it? Well, I know how much you hate it.
- Nothing's gonna change that. Maybe we should just get rid of the body. - What?
Yeah. About the sex... was it normal? Hmm, it was on a washing machine.
Oh, my God, the anomaly, it opened. Toby! Dammit! Closed again.
No. When did this relationship begin? In the spring.
Come on, you were zigging and zagging like a rastafarian. A move like that needs a name, dawg. Like hell!
Okay. We're gonna go through consent one more time. This is your arm. Your tumor is right here, near the shoulder.
This is your arm. Your tumor is right here, near the shoulder. It's stage III. It's pretty big.
- He shot my dog. - It was running loose in the woods. Why don't you give me the gun? How'd you get it anyway?
Give it to me and you're free to go. Oops. Pick it up.
- Yes... - Thank you. But I have deleted the last sequence, and without it, it's useless. And that's yours, Leo.
You were just gonna let 'em fry me? I told you, I don't know who killed Tyler. But I do know one thing for certain-- the bloody hoodie they found in Lee Moran's car didn't belong to Lee Moran.
Excuse me, Ms. Nyholm, you have referenced proceedings that resulted in a sealed transcript. Yes, but Mr. Gardner can answer to his own testimony. This question requires your knowledge of the grand jury investigation.
- We've got Kane by the balls. - We? Yeah, you told me Rosebud was Stone. I did not.
The temporalis muscle is atrophied. Any idea why, Dr. Grey? Uh, lack of use?
Division agents only respect what they've been made to fear. They've been made to fear me. My fight was never with you.
Look! What a lovely sky! Look at it!
See this -- all this? It's not just any zombie movie. This the original zombie movie.
To me. All right, listen to me. When you were 4 years old, you came home one day with a cat.
! Let's just hope he doesn't see this. This hummus is wonderful.
What's so urgent? I got a little disturbing news the other day I wanted to... bounce off my Mexican brethren. It turns out there was this RICO case, right?
Sir? Sir? The abduction was unexpected.
Means it's brown now, but was originally painted white and blue-- a very distinctive white and blue as a matter of fact. Detective Bell. We are looking for a decommissioned NYPD van, presumably sold at auction, then painted brown.
That bloody case. Curse of my life. You need to find it.
So what's your point? You asked me if the machine was capable of learning human nature. I'm saying it already is.
You'll have access to all the camera feeds through your cell phone. And this alarm system, does it call the local police? No-no, no.
Because that's what an urologist is. Oh. So my penis is fine, right?
Now, Frank says you claimed to have seen... some sort of creature that was alive. Maybe it escaped on its own. I doubt that, Sister.
Ready. Bring me the cat. What's supposed to happen?
God knows those coins aren't healthy to be around. And we did a little more digging, found out Kimura is tied to a secret organization called the dragon's tongue. It was founded in 1901, connected to the Japanese imperial army.
There is a certain deliberateness. We degrade our national wealth to slander it after its degradation, and convince Greek public opinion that maybe a private company .is a far better solution for the Greek railways. In the name of rationalisation, the government further degrades the railways.
Most of these private companies feed off the state and earn instead of offering. The public power company was not built by the private sector. It operated for 60 years thanks to the public's money.
The public power company was not built by the private sector. It operated for 60 years thanks to the public's money. It brought electricity to the whole country.
James. James, it's gonna be all right. The barn saved you last time.
I really appreciate you taking the time to meet with me. Yeah, well, it's nice to have someone else asking the questions for a change. Plus Professor Peiser taught my favorite journalism class at Columbia.
- You feel that? - There's a stream. - Go on.
If it was because of the blood, I'd have done it in the morning. I did it much later. That's what you say.
And, uh, just FYI, pigeons nest under there. My car already looks like it's covered in mashed potatoes. I'll get it washed for you.
Like the "Mona Lisa" with a lot of expectations! You look pale... (Distorted voice) Like "Mona Lisa." (Voice echoing) This business is my namesake.
- You don't screw this up. - We won't. Dr. Ross, you'll make sure that the liver gets here?
See for yourself. Now, you can wait for the computers to confirm it if you like, but Wade Crewes lied to you about that murder weapon. He didn't dump it.
So what if he is my dad? How did you find out? My mom kept a diary.
And? And not one of the arresting officers was able to tell me where the tip came from. Maybe they didn't know.
Here's your ship certificate. The elders say, someone has cursed the sea. That's why it retreated.
Did you see it? I don't think so. Oh, you'd know so.
Something others were afraid to do. A thicker sound was a better sound. It had to bite you, get to you.
Nice, huh? I like this song. Me, too.
You think you could make Loki tell us where the Tesseract is? I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield.
Jay, you fool. I say unto thee, the power of Christ compels you! Does it?
No one... I mean, no one has ever been closer to me than this young man. I want to make sure he's taken care of forever... no matter what happens to me. The coat costs $300,000.
Okay, first things first, I need the armour. Where are we at with it? It's not charging.
His eyes were just like yours. The planet was Furya. I know what it's called.
It's a piece of ormolu. Did you ever hear of it? It's golden, French, 1800s.
That suits me fine. But you... You have a gift.
We say, "Gift from God." Kolyma, get up! The river is flooding.
Strange. After all this time, whenever I think about you, Xenya's ribbon. I found it in Aunt Katya's toolshed.
It's raised five foot since then. Mr. Wheatfield crossed it. If the bridge was just up.
This thing's huge. This is the biggest spider that I've ever seen, maybe the biggest spider on record, and from the look of the bite that it gave that mortician, I'd say this thing is highly poisonous, aggressive, fast, smart. It's strong, really strong.
I can't remember. When the ash tree was created... it made all the other trees in the forest jealous, because it was...
And what is the reason behind this embargo? T.S., do you know where this smell of those marvellous sausages comes from? It's from a smell factory, on the New Jersey Turnpike.
Mother told them to us as children. Their leader Malekith made a weapon out of that darkness and it was called the Aether. While the other relics often appear as stones the Aether is fluid and everchanging.
Their leader Malekith made a weapon out of that darkness and it was called the Aether. While the other relics often appear as stones the Aether is fluid and everchanging. It changes matter into dark matter.
The people at the hotel gave us a story about you and another man and her, all sexing together in a pile. It's disgusting. But to answer your question, the Lo-yack is an excellent product.
Let's go. Father. I'm going to pull out the arrow now. Don't touch it.
I fall off the ladder. The ladder? The ladder my soul must ascend to heaven.
With a snake around her neck. Snake in the grass. I had a snake once.
Bring me some cheese. The cheese will be served after the cakes, my lady. The cheese will be served when I want it served.
Where is the camera? Let me see ix. Later.
What're you all gabbing about back there? We were talkin' about the old library. Yeah, what's happening to it?
Yeah. Well, I'm switching you to buckshot. Yeah. Doesn't have the stopping power of a 12-gauge, but you seem comfortable with it.
If you are this killer, that identity runs through these events like a thread through pearls. Cassie Boyle would have been your first victim. You said her crime scene was practically gift-wrapped.
- 12 weeks ago. - 12 weeks ago? Lung cancer. You don't smoke.
Got your babysitting duty, huh? Yeah. You mind if I have a quick word with your prisoner?
They should also study my cock in science class cos it defies nature. My cock is hard. It's metal, it's steel, it's titanium.
My cock is hard. It's metal, it's steel, it's titanium. It does not break.
My cock can stand all day like a good soldier trying to impress his superiors. If my cock could win a medal, it would. If they could name a school after it, it should.
Wars should be won over it, kingdoms fallen because of it. My cock is lightning. It is fire.
[Groaning] Why did you even do the movie? It was such an epic piece of shit. [Chuckles] Crazy Little Thing made close to $300 million worldwide.
I love this place. Hey, to this... to this place. I don't feel it.
My agent sent it How did he get hold of it? What's the problem?
When we devised the plan to stop the invasion, you didn't think we could succeed. You doubted yourself. I knew the tulip would give you strength, as it had before. It was your symbol of hope and absolution.
How do we get them to 2167? That's what the magnet is for. It's used as a launch platform.
The bottle? What bottle? This old copper jug.
The head should pass through your body in three to five days. Unless you start vomiting or have severe cramping, it's best just to let the body eliminate this on its own. I'm gonna have to shit it out.
Unless you start vomiting or have severe cramping, it's best just to let the body eliminate this on its own. I'm gonna have to shit it out. If it made it down your esophagus, it should travel the rest of the way.
Thank you, This clock is broken. Yes, it's broken.
Adam is great. I trust Adam. I just, I just don't know if I'm ready. I can't stop thinking about this SD card.
I just, I just don't know if I'm ready. I can't stop thinking about this SD card. Why did it disappear when Markussen died?
Free. Of course. The Code noir a decree that dictated the conditions of slavery, did not exist on these grounds.
Can you trace the source of the email? - Alec? - On it.
You jumped to the other side. You put me on the other side. I had a deal that put your name right next to mine.
Yes, I'm sure he is a man who plays many roles. Luckily you don't have to worry about censorship with the show because it's so tame. Of course it's for daytime entertainment.
Beautiful, is it not? Unroll it like this, and the story flows out in the pictures. Yeah!
Of course! This robe is the genuine article! Placed in the fire, it will not burn.
Did he kill Norma Rivera? After a week of vetting him, I haven't been able to find definitive proof. But I'm sure, if I keep following him, the truth will become clear.
You jack that ring, too? - Yeah. Lyric was telling me about this blue ring her grandmother used to have. She would always try to steal it, but...
Light 'er up. Hey, if it isn't Jay Plunkett. It isn't.
Hurting the Indians won't make you white! I saw the zone. Pedro's work is disgusting.
You didn't know that that was a part of the plan, did you? Listen to me, Briggs, okay? That jawbone, it messes with your head, okay?
I lied. He gave me a disc to take home and watch. Thought it would persuade me to tell my story.
25 years ago. It's like Monty Python's parrot sketch. Eriksson suggests that the investigation is dead.
But I'm Chris Brown. Speaking of Chris Brown, I'm gonna start to batter. How's that stove?
Speaking of Chris Brown, I'm gonna start to batter. How's that stove? Warm, but it's really wobbly.
L-let me guess. You're gonna tell me the best pizza's in New York and I gotta try it, right? Actually, it's in the Kingdom of Damarian on the north shore of the Dragon Fields of Zorn.
The Dragon. The liquid in the bottle, it worked. It cured me, August.
It's all black. You fought for a machine that doesn't work. It's possible.
You scare me so much... that I can neither move nor flee. The wolf starts to circle around me. It smells me. It hesitates...
But will he be too late? He greets his young for the very first time. The coolness of the Benguela Current brought the penguins here but that very coolness is a great disadvantage, because it generates little rain.
And yet the vast desert it created is a source of life half a world away. The advancing Sahara vaporised the world's largest lake, leaving behind the silvery remains of countless microscopic algae. In winter, the wind carries away 700,000 tonnes of this mineral-rich dust every day.
I was hoping you could give us some guidance. He was a smartass kid. His armor was weird.
You show me where that computer is now. Let's go. Let's go!
- Where's the letter? - I don't know where it is. - Isn't it in the box?
Now... please join me in honoring her with 60 seconds of absolute silence. Okay, Neruda, this play is extremely complicated. Let me guess.
(Kurdish) What happened to your face? A dog attacked me. How did you get away?
A dog attacked me. How did you get away? I attacked back, it got scared and ran away.
Coast Guard is monitoring the waterways. We've got two choppers in the air, DC's sending more. Okay. So what about the Sheriff's residence?
Let's not keep them waiting. I know what I'm saying. National service, it has become worthless.
Busted up your ride, racing around town like you got a Mad Tyte JDM? I have no idea what you just said. Where's your car?
You were raised far from reality. You trust anyone. You recognize this ring?
May be? What if it doesn't work? If it doesn't work, there's another way. What is it?
You would just... leave everything? I found a town like the one yesterday. It's about two hours outside of Denver.
Yeah, I guess it is. Your mom really does hate change. Oh, I visited our fort today.
I'm sure it will. The Spear of Longinus? It has touched the very blood of your Christ.
The Spear of Longinus? It has touched the very blood of your Christ. You know where it is?
It has touched the very blood of your Christ. You know where it is? It sat deep beneath Jerusalem, buried, for centuries.
Like a black hole. Invisible, but powerful. So tell me, where did you move the machine?
So tell me, where did you move the machine? It moved itself. But who controls it?
I don't know about you, but I don't want to see what happens when an evil multinational becomes omniscient. But why you would leave it so vulnerable? You made the machine to protect everybody.
Maybe I'm a little picky. Can people really change? Is our personality genetically pre-programmed?
It's the military chip they put in her head, it makes her loco, you better watch that. Maybe you need to wake up, start thinking for yourself? This kind of tactic gets us nowhere.
- I'm not snapping. - Yeah, you are. I'm sorry I asked the question.
Yes, but it doesn't breathe. Like a fish. A fish doesn't breathe? Like an oyster.
Like an oyster. So, when it's washed up, it's dead? Yes.
What's that? I have two of them, from a surgery I had to correct misshapen cartilage I was born with. I had a bar put in when I was 14.
Well, it's... Yeah. And look at that view.
Friends don't call friends names. I know what the mirror does Jordyn. Look into it and gain your deepest desire.
They wouldn't even let him see the body. Somebody called for a... I want his body.
I am looking for the owner of a hubot. It is a 400 TwinX. A female.
Where are we going? We're leaving. I packed your suitcase.
But no matter what they call it, it won't bring back those men, or my family. Damn sure won't change who I am. You're refusing to sign the statement?
Excuse me. Did you find that book in this box? Yeah.
That's what you get when you ruffle feathers. Mrs Blunt said the library door was locked when she came back to the house. Well, obviously someone locked it when they left.
You dropped your gun. It was empty. You only fired one shot.
I believe El Cucuy wanders from place to place. And waits until it is called by voices of women who have suffered from evil. If enough voices cry out, they become one voice that cannot be ignored.
Must be an electrical fault. You saw it. - I don't know what you're talking about.
Ooh, Chicago! There is this pizza place called Gazzola's. It's fantastic.
Does the spearmint lose its flavor On the bedpost overnight? If you pull it out like rubber
How many mermaids could they summon in an emergency? You might be in some trouble, mate. That trident's mine.
I can't stop it in the middle. It will completely destroy the model. Just because I printed a fork does not mean my research is a joke.
Something I never intend to do again. There's a junkyard in Tarrytown with an industrial car compactor. I've seen it turn an SUV into an ice cube.
Anslo Garrick? Listen to me. If this intel was disseminated, it was done so directly to you.
Well, it is possible to stop it. - What? - By using the scroll itself.
what, did somebody call in a missing doughnut? uh, actually someone reported they couldn't find your head. but we found it.
You stay over my place for the weekend, And there's hair all over every pillow, and a bra on every door knob. You got a bra in my silverware drawer. - Oh, which one?
- Why? Last week, there was a young boy here with a crust of bread he'd spread with honey. He threw it, but his aim was bad.
And you still can change everything. Oh, we got a hugger. Be careful.
Two cars we haven't tried yet. - The minivan and the green SUV. - Yeah. Okay. I'll head for the SUV, draw the mimics to me. You go for the minivan.
And the engine? Where is the engine? - It got wedged in.
The phones are going crazy. What happened at that reading? Well, it was a really good crowd.
I can't do this, I'm so sorry. Ben's been through all this before. His grief isn't new.
Ben's been through all this before. His grief isn't new. But it's new for me.
His grief isn't new. But it's new for me. And it'll be new tomorrow.
The rest is up to us. The Box? Yeah.
I'm fucking with you, Joshy. Your thing is gonna be totally brilliant. I remember when this song was just considered bad.
It's not a question of being rusty. I can flip the switches. I can turn the knobs. But my power comes from here. It comes from...
You sure? Yes. The storm cannot be stopped.
There it is. This tornado just touched down. We can see it from here.
Come on. Let's not argue, okay? We came up with an awesome plan. It is smart.
You're really keeping this? Er, yeah. Sure?
That carriage vanished, so it must be somewhere. But why, though? Why detach it in the first place?
It needs to grow. To advance. Right now, it's settling somewhere it thinks it's safe from outside threats. Somewhere its massive appetite for power can be met.
Somewhere its massive appetite for power can be met. But it will want more than that. After a while survival won't be enough.
He hung himself in his jail cell with a sheet. Before he died, he revealed that my mother's body was in the freezer, and that he'd taken it out during the night while I was sleeping. He buried her up in the mountains.
I mean, great, great. Well done, Dominic. Hey, I have an amazing idea for an act.
Balin, if Thorin... had the Arkenstone... or if... it was found... would it help? That stone crowns all. It is the summit of this great wealth... bestowing power... upon he who bears it.
Would it stay his madness? No, laddie. I fear it would make him worse.
That frog is not poisonous. What? We're not dead?
- What are you doing? This plant needs to be pruned... in order to grow right. So, I was...
What do you mean? The Death Wolf isn't a demon. It's meant to go after wicked folk.
It's a big deal for us. Listen, could you take a look at that tablet? There's something wrong with it.
Yeah, you can run, but if you leave those gates... I swear to you, your hideous doppelganger... who looks a lot like the lead singer of the Counting Crows... will get it! Dada. That's right.
You know, our machine. The Shadow. When you sold it to Robbie, how'd you get it back? I didn't.
I know a man, ex-member himself, very useful at sorting out our scrapes over the years. I don't give a shit about the club. Smash it.
Are you concentrating yet? You broke my arm! No, I sprained it.
What happens if I use the card now? It still doesn't work. But it doesn't read as the wrong card now.
- It ha... it has night vision. - They have night vision? That tiger has night vision goggles?
- They have night vision? That tiger has night vision goggles? It doesn't have night vision goggles.
- This. Yes, exactly. So, the needle, you have to secure it. Good.
We used to fuck for hours. His cock was like a battering ram. It was like it was made of liquid metal.
As we all know, this could hardly be a more threatening moment. We meet at a dangerous time when a setback in the financial markets has been misrepresented as a crisis in the engine room of capitalism itself. We all remember how quickly the Berlin Wall came down.
MPs took it. Check the data on it. It'll have all my keystrokes logged, back up what I'm saying.
I have a bad connection. I'm listening. I have a... I have a message for you.
Oh, and one last reminder. The weapons' rack is stocked with the latest and the greatest. And my personal favorite is the Mauser Elite SSX Double Barrel. It has a delicate trigger, and smoothest discharge.
Bye. The Burguesinha is well loose. More Than in Cheers.
I told you. You told me a lot yesterday. I like Marie-Colette's magazine.
Are we clear? The exchange is tomorrow held in Luxembourg. I do not know where I should at Jacob Sturm wait with the expert.
Corporal Joseph De Castro. He fought for the Union. Linda, I don't know what to say. It's clear the President sees you as a friend. I've never been that to him. But his job is bigger than friendship.
We call this "proximity overlook." Yeah, well, the rest of the world calls it stalking. What you're seeing here is aerial surveillance footage of the Bawri Tana marine combat outpost -- or what's left of it.
They actually live in gamer houses. So it's set up to be a thing all year long. I think their approach to practice is that it's like a day job. The fan base is immense.
Anything, mosaic works, as well. This lamp is perfect! But that's not for sale.
Well, Henry. Henry Renard, the only son of Harrison Renard. So, tell me about this company, Delphi.
Or find someone to do it for you. You said you were worried about the bird. Thought you might like to see it.
This way. My boy's wound won't heal. It never heals.
There will always be people with a need for companionship and... and connection. If your board had let me finish, I would have told them that filling that void is way more important than building a more empathetic service bar. I'm sure you understand that the future you're proposing raises great moral questions.
That's great. Your plan worked. Yeah.
She's just gone. After that, that's when they found me. I mean, I knew they were bad, but they had a code.
Can't you see that? Norman, stop it! He can't help it!
I am a dungeon master. I create a boundless world, and I bind it by rules. Too heavy for a bridge?
Yeah, me too. Hey, quick, turn off your car. Why?
We can put a stop to that. There is a bone in the back of your ear. It's the stapes... or stirrup.
People want this. We have to...? That chair in front of you, we are very proud.
Put this on and remove your chain. - It's a lucky charm. - Put it on later. I can't take it off.
At high tide, we'll have two, three feet clearance. That canal is so narrow, we won't have any margin for error. And then there's the coral growth.
That's not all we found. I've got research here, something about a Bible-- the Gutenberg Bible? The Gutenberg Bible?
I've got research here, something about a Bible-- the Gutenberg Bible? The Gutenberg Bible? It's on a world tour.
The Gutenberg Bible? It's on a world tour. It's leaving New York tomorrow for Venice, Italy.
Let me explain something to you. The sun throws a certain amount of energy onto this planet. We turn it into food, clothing, shelter, et cetera.
You see? Do you like the rabbit? You like it?
You know, the ones we'll need in order to put out any fires at the parade? The plan is constantly evolving, Sue. It's alive.
Tell me. Tell me who it is I'm touching. So much pain this body has seen.
All I see is a dumpster. - Yeah, it's my apartment. I converted it, and I live inside.
Did you hit him? No, the sex was fine. Actually, it was better than fine.
I found your Mustang. Looks like it's been abandoned. I'm going to check it out.
He kept it solely to remind Pardillo of their mutually-assured destruction. Well, it won't be much use to a DA, either. I stole it from his office.
This rosary he mentions. Valuable, is it? It's reputed to have healing powers. You don't say?
What? You're fired. The address calculation code. It's too long.
I call you the facts, The U,S, government is funded by the rich, It keeps the people on the intellectual level of children,
People like Snowden or Assange, which provide valuable information, be prosecuted by the U,S, government, It is funded by the rich, She wants the people ignorant and hold the intellectual level of children,
I learned that the day you kicked out the crate from beneath me. I think I found it. Get outside.
If he has the poison, just treat him. I'm sorry, but not without knowing the species. I need a sample.
But we have two problems now. First, the lichen is not a cure. It'll wear off in a matter of days.
No rhyme, no reason, right? Meaning what? Our enemy is not a killer.
Yeah. You had a few of them, if I'm not mistaken. What about the Hess case? What about it?
What's going on up there? Then the Aswang would flick its long black tongue and eat the baby. No... uh, actually, no, not at first.
On our microwave. We have the same microwave. Oh, I didn't buy it.
Sling is over there, nipple clamps on the bedside table with some erotic oils and handcuffs. Dildos and toys are on the wall. Oh, I got that strap-on in Zanzibar in the 19th century.
I wondered if I might ask you a few questions about the man that mugged you. Did you get it? Did the file open up all right?
And I might have a lead on who's doing the shooting. The solicitation Ms. Groves gave me is visually identical to an image commonly sent out as spam. But digitally someone has hidden a message inside the image.
I broke the encryption. All right. Look up her internet searches.
Just say it. A submarine went down... the Belomorsk. We lost 160 men... a... a catastrophic propeller malfunction of some kind.
Besides the fact that I have bone cancer, I'm great. Seriously. Look at this polish.
It's a small town, big of heart. Let's swap sides. My right side is...
- Is that your gut? No, my gut says that whoever ran away is our killer and that Lily Greene is a completely innocent schoolteacher who just had the worst night of her life. Would you like a cup of coffee?
I want you to take your name off. I already did. This case was never for me.
"This is super awkward." This is super awkward. You know, I bet you if I stayed in Poland, my sisters and I would have had our own show.
He was coming after me, so I just... I shoved him into the hallway and... and closed my eyes, and I swung as hard as I could. You always keep a machete in your room? It's not mine.
But it's gone too far, and it has to stop. Please, who built the machine? How does it work?
Did you find the mouse yet? No, I just finished setting the traps. Don't worry.
Ask me that question when you have earned the right. The day of my marriage, a secret contract was slipped in amongst the others. The French arranged it with my mother.
I've smoked so much pot, it's in one of those hospitals learning to walk again. What was the Great Compromise? You mean besides you moving in with me?
In 21, we'll turn on each other. The time to act is now. How'd this virus get inside the dome?
Quarantine the healthy animals. This is what Rebecca was messing around with in her kitchen. That pig virus is their extermination plan.
Popular choice in decorative office greenery. Thrives even when neglected. The Ficus is an aggressive grower;
My right. Damn it, Ginsberg. Put it back.
See? You forgot about Andy already. Why, you're... You're a freak.
You know what the trick is? You throw a noodle up on the ceiling. If it sticks, you know it's perfect.
You throw a noodle up on the ceiling. If it sticks, you know it's perfect. It's still on my ceiling, isn't it?
I don't have anything yet. The idea I had wasn't great. It wasn't great.
You finally looked at my paper, congratulations. I looked at it when I rejected it from the Physics Review a year ago. But that line wasn't a line from your paper.
You're never going back in there. You should not make promises you cannot keep. My freedom is temporary.
- I said settle down! Oh, I found it! They dumped it in the basin.
We need to make a decision and commit to it. So if someone has a better idea, say it now! Heads, we get the body.
You don't need to be liked. You've got all the guns. A moleculon nanoscaler! You know what it does, then?
It has to be. I'm gonna call Neal. Hey, we opened the file.
To free him would reveal what you are to him. You think he could love you then? Do not lose his love.
And now my heart is filled with a different pain. Before I forget, um, in my bag, there is a file I meant to give you earlier. There it is, in my purse.
But who's looking out for Marvin? Claudette. How was your drive?
What? I saw the ticket in Mrs Hughes's hand when she found it in the coat. It hadn't been torn in half.
How long does she expect to keep going if she keeps giving her rations away? The rest of us are dehydrated, aslee-- It came through the brush.
This isn't just physical strength. There's an alien life-form fusing with your human DNA. It -- it wants to control all of you.
So, why the hell did you interrupt? ! I have been deconstructing the Espheni whistle you brought back. You are correct.
Before his untimely death, my brother implemented a safeguard. That triskelion she wears -- it doesn't mean "peace." It never did.
You were lucky to have that transgender person to help. Thanks for what you did. Bates's gear is not all it's cracked up to be. There is a bad stash of gear coming into the prison.
Last night my printer went off by itself. I couldn't turn it off. I hit the cancel button.
No. I don't think you're gonna be taking me anywhere. I can hear the recorder in your pocket.
Ladies be crazy, Javi. The card's rfid architecture is like nothing I've ever seen. Yeah, but there's got to be something else that you can tell us about it.
Bazooka rockets. He called them shaped charges. But a nuclear core is no rocket.
You could've left him in the building, you know. I'd be tempted. Can you get anything from your computer?
Turn the noise down! Turn it the fuck down, you motherfuckers! There are other people in the fucking world!
Thanks to you, Constantine. What do you want with the acetate, Midnite? There's no money it in.
I drew on the disc's own dark magic to send it back to hell where it belongs. It belongs to me. It's mine!
It was a necklace that Stefan had given me. I'd lost it, and Damon knew what the necklace meant to me. My necklace.
It's up to me now to make sure his sacrifice wasn't in vain. What will you do? You told me you wouldn't help me fight a war, John. Well, sometimes a war comes to you.
- Honestly... This is the last time I give you a plant. - Why? Look at it.
Tell me what you're feeling. This couch is terrible. It doesn't match anything.
Ho, ho, ho! Well, that sucked. So the letter was actually from her parents?
It's good to meet you, too, Caleb. I guess the first thing I should do is explain your pass. Now, it's simple enough.
Off we go. I'm seeing stars, my foot hurts so much. It could be broken.
You're absolutely positive? His solution was correct. He'd had it for years.
I'm Reese. It's me, Sarah. All right, listen, the terminator's not dead.
I am not a great writer. I am not Hawthorne. But from my first hearing of it, this tale has haunted me.
Yeah! And I love my Ford Flex. It treats me to a smooth ride, and you know what?
It tracks subprime mortgage bond value. Go back to sleep. The ABX is at...
Mark, hey. It's a bloodbath up here. Morgan stock has lost half its value. It's down to 23. 10.
I was jumping all over the place. I was so excited. Felt weird pointing a rifle at you even if it weren't loaded. Oh, I always keep it loaded.
It was time for goodbye. You understand that it is too far? I cannot carry this body with me.
Oh, hell no. Where is my purse? Have you seen it anywhere?
Oh, no! I don't have the page! Oh, no!
♪ It's true ♪ Old friends are just such a waste ♪ The coach was heading to London.
Look, the big companies, they pay me for my shelf space. Maybe you can sell one of your mops to those big companies. And maybe they'll put it on my shelf.
I know what you're thinking, but not yet. Hold it. How is this jackass stuck?
It escaped capture... aboard a stolen Corellian YT model freighter. The droid... stole a freighter? Not exactly, sir.
That happens when you're being hunted... by a creature in a mask. Tell me about the droid. He's a BB unit with a selenium drive... and a thermal hyperscan vindicator.
I thought you said the dog was dead. I left it out there on its own. Thought it would perish in the cold.
What happened to your hand? I actually... I dropped a couch on it. Was it heavy?
Our parents brought that on themselves. What are you talking about? The box?
Just like a woman to wear jewelry into battle. Although, this is the ugliest fucking necklace I've ever seen! Yes, it is.
I'm not gonna kill you. I have a job for you. And a gold coin if you get it done.
Good night. - What about your jacket? Keep them.
I can't tell you the number of people I talked to who say, "Well, but if we became less materialistic our economy would tank." Well, they're right in some level, because our economy is based on materialism, it's based on these kinds of values. That's what it needs in order to survive.
- You gotta show them your panties. And you idiots! Tell her to shake it.
If there's anybody leading a resistance in this town, it's not Harold, so who else is involved in this group? This group is the only thing that's kept me sane here. How long have you been active?
- Is he sick? It's strange, it comes and goes. But he's doing well now, the fresh air will do him good.
It's strange, it comes and goes. But he's doing well now, the fresh air will do him good. It does everyone good.
I don't care about that game. I want you to cut off my arm. - Why not keep it?
That was awesome! Hold on tight. We're gonna give you an even closer look at our Mosasaurus.
We have no time. There's a western tunnel. It leads to an elevator. I know the code.
A violence initiated by these evil men... will be brought to justice... in the name of decency... and in the memory of Luis Carlos Galán. We will extradite. This decision... will not come from fear.
One skin cell, one strand of hair, that's all I need to grow a piece of Aleister. There is no getting used to this. What will this spell accomplish?
There were so many, we gave them to all the neighbours. This plum tree's getting old. I think Grandpa planted it the year mum was born.
You're a genius, you shit gold, and Oscars are made of gold. But this film is different. It's humane, you know?
The Verbis Diablo, the Devil's Tongue, has roots as old as Aramaic and likely much older. It was an oral tradition for the most part like most now dead languages. We haven't entirely lost it, we've just forgotten it.
Disguise it as you might try, Sir Malcolm recognised your picture. Perhaps he's just a fan from my theatrical days. Do you know of the medical neurosis called the phantom limb?
Begin. This fruit is defective. How so?
This fruit is defective. How so? It's all nasty and bruised up.
How do I put this constructively? This piece of writing is".obscene. It's pornographic.
There now... Did you hear that my boys paid the locals a visit? They bought a goat and are calling it Preben.
So relax. It isn t complicated. The truth has no need for ploys.
It isn t complicated. The truth has no need for ploys. It s naked, it doesn t say anything, it s obvious.
This bill, did you read it? Emergency room bill. I may have glanced at it.
Oh, you guys are very sweet. So, Penny, listen, I saw your movie. Oh, wow.
Hans Peter? My husband? The Camino robs you of all of your strength... and gives you three times as much back. And to all those who cannot walk the Camino, rest assured, this Way is only one of an endless number of possibilities.
In the meantime, I think we found a way inside. We've been combing through the employee records, looking for a shell. - I'm cooking the ID now.
The plan's perfect. Or we could also wait until we actually get into college and then figure out where to live. I have a vision, dude.
I swear, everyone I know has had problems with them. I had one. The computer in the engine, it locked in the middle of the Rockies.
You look so different. You look exactly the same. Good, you found my backpack.
It's going great. I can't hear you. Where are you? I'm at the library. Nice.
Said the guy who can't write a grocery list. - Shh, shh... - Ready whenever you are, sir. Today marks the 80th Anniversary of the Social Security Act.
Then I accept. Your Majesty has shown great wisdom and discretion. Do this, and you will never lay your hands on the cipher.
I think it's time for us to rebuild our family. Leave the light on. Note the effect on the pupils of a few drops of adrenaline chloride.
Excuse me. Everyone knew you were the famous Dr. Thackery. You say I fixed it with a gold earring?
Nothing to do with me? Our connection runs much deeper than a hand print. Deeper than hell shoes.
God you're beautiful. Famous words to a succubus. The last thing your mother said to me was your name.
My fellow citizens, this is your president speaking. I have news to share with you that will change all of our lives forever. For 97 years, Mount Weather has been our home.
You asked Dave if I had a blue ja... I saw a blue jacket in the woods with a bloodstain on it. I thought you'd want to know!
That smell, am I right? Smell? Oh, yeah, there's some sort of an odor.
I keep you because you're a serpent. Do not be a viper in my bosom. You know my decision.
Not even in your mind? Your memory palace is building. It's... full of new things.
It's impossible to avoid for what I'm trying to do. But I take no pleasure in it... in cruelty. But this city isn't a caterpillar.
Do you know the story of the bumblebee? The bumblebee is too heavy to fly. It has a very dense body and tiny wings.
I'm not so sure about that. Did you know that the bumblebee is unable to fly? It shouldn't be able to fly with its tiny wings.
Jessica DiLaurentis. Mrs. DiLaurentis saw Spencer in the backyard and told the police? Where's the statement been for two years?

The hurricane turned. It's due east now. It might hit Bermuda.
Are you satisfied? I lost my job because of you. You did not lose it. You know where it is.
But Devon is. So this office printer wasn't on the same network as the other printers? No, it was. Then why didn't it burn?
Their way is what got us here. - You started this war. This war started decades ago, when SHIELD was founded to guard the world against people like us.
Good night. And how do you plan to find it? I held on to the vita-ray detector from project rebirth.
Come on! Come on! This city doesn't deserve a better tomorrow. It deserves to drown... in its filth!
- You expect us not to fight back? - We need the violence to stop. If it continues, the peacekeeping mission will fall apart.
I found the truck. It has an eagle-shaped hood ornament. I spoke to a rest stop waitress who had seen it.
It has an eagle-shaped hood ornament. I spoke to a rest stop waitress who had seen it. It was abandoned three days ago.
I hate this. Now, even if you wanted to kill someone with a guitar, you would naturally grab it by the neck, not the body. But let's just assume that it was used that way.
Because tomorrow... This is happening. 4:00 p.m. sharp. I have a meeting at 4:00.
Anyone on blaine's trail will be in danger And we can't warn them. And if they do manage to catch him, Then there's the whole zombie-in-a-prison problem. And then there's the body.

You know about immigration law? Doesn't everybody? Okay, tough guy, what do you think about my strategy on this?
I wrote that letter thinking I'd never see you again. None of us are responsible for our hearts... only our actions. I do read Henry's bible.
That's nice, but it's not true. I'm having problems with the oven. It doesn't heat well.
What dream? I've had it here and there for about six months. I'm walking in the woods, carrying a body.
It's the disease. Remember what the dementia does? It gives you delusions.
- My son! - It's empty. - My son! - It's empty! The stroller is empty!
Blow it up! Blow it up! Blow it up! Blow it up!
Surrender now and Mary will live. Your plan relies on the cooperation of a fickle English queen who does not take kindly to the advice of others.
Get away! No! - Please tell me you have the camera. - What's wrong?
What do you mean, Harry? Two years ago, when the Machine moved itself, it didn't go to a data farm. It went into the wires.
Welcome to the family. How'd you like that drink? I liked it.
What changed everything? This pendant. It's not mine.

They've executed my men. Where are the Zygons? We need to bomb the hell out of this place.
$50 bill, key card, and a cash receipt. From a coffee shop in the city, dated yesterday. This card looks like a hotel key.

So maybe you're the reason why we're here, and maybe everyone will learn about the real Simon Asher once and for all now that I know they should, too, right? Eh, mahal? The new agent review board investigates any and every breach of the Nat code of conduct.
Any secret, no matter how small, can be used as a weapon by someone who wants something from you. This scar isn't a secret. It's a reminder of who I used to be.
That's not gonna cut it here, Liam. Whatever the FBI is doing, it's not enough. The real bomber is inside the Bureau.
It moulds itself into a humanoid form. It's adaptable. It's clever.
You know I'm a survivor. This ring is why. I've had it for many years.
- It sure was. The Quaken was just being defensive. It was scared and all by itself.
You don't have to remind me. I know exactly what they can do. This plan is insane. You know that, right?
What do you think of this color? It's great, actually, super vivid. It'll totally make your eyes pop.

Whatever deal you made to get your revenge on Gold, it's not worth it. The darkness is using you. It doesn't care what you want.
Which was the standard in Europe from the fifth to the 19th century. But the signature is fake? No.
You're scared, but you look tough. The human soul is corrupt. It only worships power.
The human soul is corrupt. It only worships power. It keeps searching for new things to worship.
How did a werewolf get a pilot's license? It's got the intelligence of a man. Yeah, but you'd think when it applied for a license... somebody would have said something.

She's the... What? Oh, that's what we call her over there... "The Machine."
What? Well, did you see this sticker? What is it?
I'm going to remind you of something, son, something you already know. The world ain't all Dilly Bars and debutante balls. The world throws wicked punches.
Work? Yeah. A body was found on parklands in western Virginia.
I know what I'm doing. You could possibly make 12 different shows out of this show. It's a very flexible frame in terms of tonality, in terms of action, in terms of mythology, in terms of subject matter.
This bird is no good. I tell you, no good! The priest won't accept it.
Complicated? The dark dimension is volatile. Dangerous.
"Then, he leaned in to kiss her, and finally said..." Oh, that's rich. How does the story end?

My family feels an unspeakable joy at the hope of Christ's return. We feel love, the love of Jesus. It...it lifts us up, it carries us forward.
I don't know why you would. This sweater goes with everything. It's a neutral.

This mission is cursed. It's not cursed. Shark head.
- Yeah. - That's correct, believe it or not. - Holy shit, a $50 shot of tequila?
As I gazed upon the quaint city streets, I found it hard to believe that in a mere 40 years, the French Revolution would turn them into rivers of blood. The last time I had been here was during the delirious celebration marking the end of the Second World War. I had hoped to climb to the top of the Eiffel Tower, but the Nazis had closed it during the occupation, and it had yet to reopen.

Whether it's a young man or young woman, they become a werewolf. A very large, very powerful werewolf the people of Gevaudan called The Beast. Every night it transforms, it remembers a little more of who it used to be.
I'll be fine. Because eating a cheeseburger is a better option? This isn't for me.
Until now. Today Palmer Tech is pleased to introduce the Power Cell, a 100% recyclable battery. It can charge an electric car for thousands of miles.
You're serious? This city has enough heroes with masks on. With Ruvé Darhk as mayor, it needs a hero without a mask.
He already is with the souls of all of those Argus agents that he just killed. Wait. I'm in. I'm through Cooper's firewalls.
You don't think that destroying the entire world is completely insane? The world is what's insane. It is beyond saving.
I've been lying to myself, trying to hold on. But the part of me that loved you, the part of me that hoped for your redemption... That part was human.
I wish I had another week to edit. I think I could make it perfect. Stop it.
That's a risk we'll have to take. The risk I won't take is being overseas if the president dies. We don't even know if Congress will approve the appropriation for the bailout.
Holy shit. Why are the Yakuza digging a hole? Give me the flashlight.
But this is Hell's Kitchen. Angel or devil, rich or poor, young or old, you live here. You didn't choose this town.
- This have a lid? - There isn't one. The Niffin becomes fused with the wood.
That was the answer. If only I had known that in the past. I love my new Maria Bamford Pepper Stepper Pepper-bot.
This is where we split up. The entrance to the tunnel is right over there. Yeah.
So I can concentrate. Wake up, man. This city is screwed up because of you.
And I, as your president, must confront the storm before us. That storm is terror. More dangerous and unpredictable than any hurricane.
That storm is terror. More dangerous and unpredictable than any hurricane. It has endangered us abroad.
So that's why you're hallucinating him? Because some faux version of your brother is upset with something that you did in a fake reality? The hellstone is trying to tell me something.
Hey, Marina's strong, but so are we. Nothing like that at school, huh? Protection charm.
I think that's pretty normal. Lydia, I need to talk to you about something. What is it? Valentine sent a Shax demon to track us on our mission today.
Come here. Can you see... Can you see that little yellow star at the end of that curve?
Mi amor... There was a tunnel under the barn. We never figured out where it led to.
But I'm guessing you don't know much about the quill, do you? The sorcerer bequeathed the quill to all of you, but it is not a simple pen. It is a magical energy. It is a living, breathing entity.
It is a magical energy. It is a living, breathing entity. It's alive? Oh, yes. And when you broke it, Henry, you sent it right down here to the Underworld, its purpose unfulfilled.
Response team confirms... It's gone. The terrorist took it.
Your past, your present, your future. Say, Iris, you look amazing. Thanks, Tony. His skin changed.
When I got there, I couldn't find it anywhere. Suddenly, I remember: I put it in the glove compartment.
It's him. Welcome to my cabin in the woods. It is.
We're lucky. This TV station is old. Not that old. Not old-old.
But, how did you get here? Time sphere. The Legion has only one that wasn't destroyed when Brainiac took over.
I want to hear about the second one. It was the end of last year. I'd gotten in late from a case.
But it is. You're holding it. Tell me about the film you saw.
I was asleep. You didn't think the war was right? I never really thought about it being right or wrong.
Son, y'all know y'all can't jump. I tracked the last package to the Midtown post office it was mailed from. However, there's no evidence on the security footage of anyone mailing it from inside the station.
Watch it. No, no, no! This road is not closed.
- Oh! And Lorelai... - Huh? The virus protection software I told you about. Want me to pop it on your computer?
I miss Doyle. Calm down. I miss the sex.
-No. I saw the show twice. The Stars Hollow Gazette cannot just go down. I mean, it's not Spotlight at the Boston Globe.
I know. Beppi wants me to come back, to go on tour, to do this concert, to be La Fiamma again, because of the money. How is the pasta?
_ JEN: I'm telling you, there's a rat in the attic. I can hear it.
Yeah, I got it. ‭Okay. We'll be right there. What about your surgery?
Really, like, you... are you sure that you're okay? You know, the surgery went well. I feel pretty good.
Uh, like I said, he was a senior board member. Does anybody else know the story? I hope not.
Oh, so did you go with the dark roast? Mm-hmm. It's great with the hazelnut cream. I really love that.
Angie, found the murder weapon. It's a high-end ice Axe. Yikes.
And? And... before he worked at the Gem Soc, he sold jewelry in Paris at the first shop robbed by the Marquise. We looked into Mr. Grey. You used to work selling jewelry, and the last place you worked was robbed by thieves going after historical knock-off jewels. That robbery is what made me want to help secure such items.
It's cool, it's cool. My product... I need it back. Don't worry about it.
Even from the rest of your team. The ATOM suit is made of and powered by dwarf star alloy. It's strong enough to withstand bullets, arrows, and explosives.
I've got him. That pod... It's identical to mine.
He's not much of a phone-answerer, in my experience. Once we plug in the machine, everything will become clear, I'm sure of it. You don't even know what it does.
You don't even know what it does. Well, I mean, clearly, it... clarifies everything? Show me.
Had us holed up in some rotted-out mansion basement, had us in some decrepit zoo building? It's so he could control it. The altar is sacred--
What for? I'd like to see your report. It's confidential.
- Hi. I love your movie. Well, thanks.
- Dad? - I love this town. I absolutely love it.
Here is a letter. I found it among Miss Bai's things. Sorry,
There are stages to a demonic possession, my friend. Right now, my guess... the demon's gone possum. Gathering its strength, waiting to show its ratty little teeth.
"I like a paper diary." This Mazda is a smartphone. It does everything.
My free will. I don't think so. That medicine wasn't meant for you.
I don't think so. That medicine wasn't meant for you. It's messing with your mind.
Trust me. It's okay. Cássia, I'm already fixing the alarm.
He called me to brag while we watched her burn. Scorsese, were you able to recover anything else from the victim? I found the SD card from Hannah's bag.
Commodus, the people of Rome, they're just like you. They want to see an end to this war. I've heard it in the streets every day.
This time, the focus is on me. This invention has taken the world by storm in just the last couple of years. You'll see it at any tourist landmark.
And I survived 'cause I took my mind away. I thought, "You can never, ever harm my essence, my spirit. My body is only part of me.
All those people down there believed the wall was dividing the world. That East and West were separating people into "us" or "them." But the real division, the only one that has ever mattered, was never horizontal.
One the bodies. Guardian, what is the Fel? A magic unlike any other.
Guardian, what is the Fel? A magic unlike any other. It feeds on life itself.
A magic unlike any other. It feeds on life itself. It pollutes the user, twisting everything it touches.
We have been surrounded by predators since the shipwreck. (INFANT CRYING) The jungle consumes everything.
(DOG WHINES) Are you adopting a puppy, Mr. Harding? Yes, yeah.
But that's not the point. I dealt with the problem. I just had no idea what the solution would do to me.
Which is a perfect match for Terence. Exactly. His liver will never go to the national list.
Doubt leads to death. Tell me the legend again. Why are you so interested in hearing it?
Including Nootka. Do we have a copy of the Nootka Sound treaty yet? Where perhaps our lawyers could pick it apart?
Is that not right? Not when you're robbing a bank. At the moment, my body is going to the bank.
Izzy, you been around long enough. You know what it is. I don't make the rules. The Brooks Innovation deal is changing the course of history in this city.
So all this is just a bunch of bullshit? Including the key? No, the key was real.
Listen, I was right. You were wrong. Remember my bigfoot?
We got a letter from Eileen. Eileen? She sent it four days ago.
- Wow. - Alex? Signal's gone. Well, let's go back inside.
I think I know who took one of the vibrators. And love it. There's no other way to say it.
- What's that? - Something found in bug saliva. I had to look it up, having never seen it before.
I will pass. If you're worried about a fight... allow me to even the odds. The stone is kyanite.
Now, stand up. Take off your clothes slowly. Don't be scared, Dilaver.
Most turbocharged engines are a bit wheezy at the top end, but because the twin-scroll turbo in this is mounted in the V of the engine... just like it is in a Ferrari California, coincidentally, the rev counter is still a blur This engine is... it's a masterpiece. An absolute gem.
This engine is... it's a masterpiece. An absolute gem. So, while this may look like a Wolseley, it certainly doesn't go like one.
Few things are more beautiful than destruction, but doesn't mean I enjoy it. So this mist, you hope it'll disappear again? Yes, of course.
You don't have to tell me, but... The mist came. It saved me.
Some cases end well and you can... forget about them. But some some become a part of who you are. This job is going to change you.
Yeah? The body adapts. It protects itself.
What about it? It said "dark". Yes, well that's why we're hurrying, because there's not much light at this time of day.
