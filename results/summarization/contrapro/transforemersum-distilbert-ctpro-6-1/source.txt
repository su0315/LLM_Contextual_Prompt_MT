I'm not saying no. Obviously, it would be great. Let's talk about it over dinner tonight. A friendly dinner. We'll talk it over.
-A popular Argentinean song. -It's nice. That's a costume I could wear. It'd be a change from feathers. They always cover me in them! This is too long.
It wasn't me! It's a horrible accusation! Why did you arm yourself with a knife before going to the victim's dressing room? I wasn't armed with a knife, your Honor. I had it on me when I left my dressing room.
How can I ever express my gratitude? - Oh, 'tis nothing. Nothing? You return from Europe with a masterpiece worth $100,000, and instead of displaying it yourself, you let me unveil it at my party for Captain Spaulding. You call that nothing? - Mrs. Rittenhouse, I...
My friends, I'm highly gratified of this display of effusion. And I want you to know... My friends, I'm highly gratified of this display of effusion... My friends, I'm highly gratified of this display of effusion. Hooray for Captain Spaulding...
It's Beaugard's "After the Hunt". The original? - Most original. Be careful. Where did she get that?
The original? - Most original. Be careful. Where did she get that? Is it very valuable?
Before I get married, I'm gonna sow a couple of wild oats. The Captain's so amusing. - Isn't he charming? That's the famous Beaugard, eh? Great picture, isn't it?
Listen. - What? - Mother's going to unveil it tonight. Yeah? Suppose when she unveils it, it's not the Beaugard at all.
Flash. Before the people are coming. What's a matter? You lose it? You gotta find it.
We'd all enjoy a few words from Mr. Chandler, who will tell us something of Beaugard's life and work. And keep it clean! Mr. Chandler! My friends, you are all familiar with Beaugard. This is perhaps his masterpiece.
- Hives! You give me the painting, and I'll take care of it. - Good. Good heavens. It's gone. - Gone?
- You've got to return that painting. Painting? What painting? The painting you changed last night. You mean the piksh? - Yes.
Let me see that a minute. It's signed "Beaugard". There's the criminal. No. Beaugard is dead. Dead?
That's a spinach. - It can't be. Where's the egg? It could be spinach. Look at all the sand.
This painting wasn't stolen. It has disappeared. Yes, disappeared. And you know what make it disappear? Moths!
But I gotta kill me a pair of skunks, back apiece on the road to Santa Fe. Hey, wait, wait. Friend, how do you find that valley? Wellmore here is sending a bull train clear through to old Tom Williams's trading post. First time it's ever been tried.
But I'm gonna tell you anyhow. It seems to me you're forcing yourself on this lady. Is that how it seems to you? How else can I take it? It's nothing to me how you take it.
Is that how it seems to you? How else can I take it? It's nothing to me how you take it. But it matters a heap to me, ma'am, how you understand. Perhaps not.
Seems like that's what he's driving at. Well, you tell him that you don't want me for your squaw. I've never told Black Elk a lie yet. He knows my tongue is straight. Well, what do you mean?
Bascom, you tell them pilgrims of yours, there's 500 miles of desert ahead of us and them that don't like what's comin' to them, now's the time for 'em to turn back. Yes, sir, that pork is nearly done right now. Shank me off a snack! Get out of there. Fine piece of beef. Ah!
Oh, I'd like to kick him into pulp. Oh, I'd like to break him in two like a... Well, why not? I don't mind fists or feet, or even a gun. It's the way he throws that knife.
Looks like Crows and Cheyennes, Zeke. Yeah. Now let's throw it into 'em! Stop shooting', everybody! Stop shooting'! They're ridin' off.
Aren't you going to ask God to take care of Breck Coleman? Oh, Zeke says that Breck Coleman can take care of himself. You overplayed your hand that time, Lopez! Zeke, this is old Ben Griswell's knife. Well, where'd you find it, boy?
Oh, Zeke says that Breck Coleman can take care of himself. You overplayed your hand that time, Lopez! Zeke, this is old Ben Griswell's knife. Well, where'd you find it, boy? Lopez just left it sticking in my bedroll.
Zeke, won't you stay over for the anniversary? Yes, gal, I'll stay. Aw! And I just recollected, I got a little present for you. Oh, Zeke, what is it? Well, a young fella named Breck Coleman left it with me, and he told me to give it to you in case he didn't show up. Where is it, Zeke?
Yes, gal, I'll stay. Aw! And I just recollected, I got a little present for you. Oh, Zeke, what is it? Well, a young fella named Breck Coleman left it with me, and he told me to give it to you in case he didn't show up. Where is it, Zeke? I hid it in the holler of the big tree at the bend of the trail.
I could eat something. Live well, I'm dying. Pears he has liked. Go ahead, read on, friend! The kulak Belokon sabotages our work, hides the seeds and kills the livestock..."
Live well, I'm dying. Pears he has liked. Go ahead, read on, friend! The kulak Belokon sabotages our work, hides the seeds and kills the livestock..." I'm not giving it away!
The tractor has arrived, the whole village witnessed it. The tractor can't be standing still. Go! Go on then! Go!
What's that? A letter. Who is it from? A friend. What's it about?
A letter. Who is it from? A friend. What's it about? It's about me.
I'm not interested in your affairs. Far be it from me to read your private mail. With me it's a closed book. Finis. Never bring up the matter again.
Far be it from me to read your private mail. With me it's a closed book. Finis. Never bring up the matter again. It's private.
- I want to believe you. What's that? What you got there, Joe? What are you doing with that? Can't you forget you've seen it?
- I'll be working New Year's Eve. - Now, listen, Joe. This is the joint where you're working. And don't you be forgetting it, either. Come on in.
I'll be in here listening. Happy New Year, boys. Say, there's a lonesome touring car down the street. I was wondering if you happened to know anything about it. How should I know anything about it?
Well, this was no time to be tight with money. Tony deserved a swell send-off. - Poor kid. - Yeah, but Rico's wreath beat them all. It was big.
Arnie you're through. You hire these mugs, they miss. Now you're through. If you ain't out of town by tomorrow morning you won't ever leave it except in a pine box. I'm taking over this territory.
Well, they don't exactly give it away with cigar coupons. Well, I'll tell the world. Boy, it sure look... Oh, look at that. - Do you like it?
- There he is, the dirty double-crosser. Give it to him, Rico! No. Shoot. Shoot, Rico.
Here. Think you can run home and rat on me to Franz? "Reinhold tried to kiss me, and I let him have it!" Let me go! You swine!
The Berolina Statue, the old symbol of Berlin, high above the Alexanderplatz ― they tore it down. It's no longer standing. Why? It was metal on the outside, but hollow inside. But... this little gizmo here ― this gave me the idea. They can knock it down and turn it on its head ― it always gets back on its feet. That's right.
It's no longer standing. Why? It was metal on the outside, but hollow inside. But... this little gizmo here ― this gave me the idea. They can knock it down and turn it on its head ― it always gets back on its feet. That's right. It has metal where it counts. Think about it, folks.
- Yes. Your own composition, eh? I don't use invisible ink. What do you call this masterpiece? I haven't named it yet.
I hope you will find this comfortable. Thanks. It looks very inviting. Oh, it's nothing serious. Just a small cut from that paper clip.
Oh, it'll be a relief to see light in those dismal old windows. It will, indeed. You'll excuse me, I'm wanted on the telephone. The Abbey could be very attractive, but I should imagine it would need quite extensive repairs. I shall do very little repairing.
I lay in bed for quite a while, reading. And just as I was commencing to get drowsy, I heard dogs howling. And when the dream came, it seemed the whole room was filled with mist. It was so thick, I could just see the lamp by the bed, a tiny spark in the fog. And then I saw two red eyes staring at me, and a white livid face came down out of the mist.
Tell me. He came to me. He opened a vein in his arm and he made me drink... What is it? Who is it, Martin?
Van Helsing, the distinguished man of science whose fame is known even in the mountains of Transylvania. Doctor, I beg you to excuse me, but your daughter had better go to her room immediately. Aren't you feeling well? I hope it's nothing serious. I had a terrible dream a few nights ago and I haven't been able to get it out of my mind.
You look like a different woman. Darling, you look terrific! And I feel terrific. But it's stuffy in here. And that smell.
Your eyes. They look at me in such a strange way! Eva, my daughter! It's all right, Eva, my love. The cross.
Take care now, Frankenstein. Shut out the light. Sit down. Go and sit down. - It understands this time.
Pardon me. What did you say? I said beat it! He said beat it. Gee, I wish I'd said that.
– At my aunt's At your aunt's? Full of holes My aunt thought it would do And what do you think?
At your aunt's? Full of holes My aunt thought it would do And what do you think? That it won't do
She gave me a present. – What? A petticoat. I've got it on – A petticoat? She opened her cupboard and gave me a petticoat
Oh, about two months, I guess. Gee. That's a month apiece. [ Ollie ] 'A month apiece'! You can take it from me. When I get out, I'm going back on the farm. Boy, there's the life.
Get back to your desks. Go back to work. Don't tell me you were drunk and don't remember. - Or is it one of Bingy's snowstorms? - It's true all right.
- What play? - My play. - About the Siberian bloodhound? Siberian bloodhound? No, it's been all rewritten.
- Yes. - Have you looked in the closets? - Yes, sir. - Found no skeletons? - No, sir.
- I gotta work, ain't I? - Sure. Listen, I was in a place today, and I heard somebody say something. - What of it? - Well, they were saying...
But that's not all. Sure, they stop at nothing. You either take their beer, or they put you on the spot. I tell you, Michael, it is a wicked business. Why, only last week...
Sure, they stop at nothing. You either take their beer, or they put you on the spot. I tell you, Michael, it is a wicked business. Why, only last week... - Got it?
You see, I came home from the dance with it hidden under my wrap... for fear someone would take it from me. Well, Joan, if we weren't such good friends, I'd say... You'd say what? I won't say it. Oh, Bill.
You'd say what? I won't say it. Oh, Bill. If you'd wanted something all your life and fate laid it right in your palm? What would you do?
Hello, Hank. Do you want me? Yeah, Billy. Here's that piece of cheese. They call it "The Stolen Jools".
Do you want me? Yeah, Billy. Here's that piece of cheese. They call it "The Stolen Jools". Take it away before the Board of Health gets here.
And some will do both. - Is that it? - I think it is, General Shubin. - May I? - Surely.
Would I have taken this if I loved him? What is it? Photographs of his dispatches to Russia. Doesn't that convince you? Yes, I'm quite convinced.
- Don't, please. - What? - I don't want to frighten you, but... What is it? It would be glorious to go with you but I may never be able to see all those splendid things.
Good evening. Like to see a ship we were once passengers in? I called you gordon. Why, that's a christian name, too. Yes. I liked it.
Thanks. What's more, keep up the good work, and who knows, someday you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk. Not a bad thought, eh? What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.
- Almonds to you. Say, listen, I just heard something that'll make your head swim. Listen to this, the bank was robbed last night. Yeah, over $100,000. Who did it?
I just heard it. Bank's broke. Hurry up. - Closing your account? - Yes, sir.
Listen, if I get them out of the room, will you tell me? No, I won't. - You're protecting somebody. - No, I'm not. It doesn't matter who it is.
I'm sorry, but I'll have to verify it. Hello, Parker. Listen. I need $1 million in cash, and I've got to have it quick. What?
Hello, Parker. Listen. I need $1 million in cash, and I've got to have it quick. What? No, tomorrow is no good. I need it now.
I don't care what you say. Sing Mother Machree if you want to, but call me up. Quiet down. Take it easy, folks. Everything'll be all right.
Sing Mother Machree if you want to, but call me up. Quiet down. Take it easy, folks. Everything'll be all right. But you said it was safe.
-Go on, walk. Okay, skipper. And then we came to a park. Only there was a tremendously large yellow moon up in the sky. It was altogether too big and too bright.
-Yes, she was here again. -She's living now with her sister, you know? -Her sister? -l thought it was her aunt. -Maybe you are right. Maybe it was her aunt.
You seem to be in an awful hurry. Well, I ain't exactly got a lot of time on my hands. I have. That's your bedroom? Yes. Want to see it?
I know the exact position of her room. I've made friends with her ballet master, Pimenov. Listen, Heinrich. I've taken all my savings, everything... and I'm going to enjoy spending it. All of it. It's terribly expensive here, Heinrich.
Yes. What? - Yes. - What's the matter? The child has come.
At least you could have cleaned them. - The trustees have a few suggestions. I think you know what the trustees can do with their suggestions. "I don't know what they have to say, it makes no difference anyway, Whatever it is, I'm against it.

This needs closer examination. In fact, it needs a nightgown. Baravelli, who did this? Is this your picture? It doesn't look like me.
In fact, it needs a nightgown. Baravelli, who did this? Is this your picture? It doesn't look like me. - Well, take it away and hang it in my bedroom.
I made myself perfect in the use of the Tartar war bow. Tartar which? Tartar war bow... That one up there. It's cute.
Let him come. Give me that knife. Come out, Rainsford. Why prolong it? I'll not bungle this shot.
It's adorable. I'll take it.
It's adorable. I'll take it. I'm glad you like it.
It's adorable. I'll take it. I'm glad you like it. It's the latest model.
Now let's get this piano downstairs. Get that piano out of there, while I'll find a place to put it. I'll get it out. Get out of here and get that piano out of that box! - What were you doing up there?
Why did you get off the boat at all? You know it doesn't stop here again for four weeks, don't you? Sure, I do. Think I'm overjoyed about it? But it's just got to be, that's all. - Well then? - I left the boat here for the same reason I took it at Saigon. - What reason?
Oh, gee, that's swell. He's such a nice kid. Say, what's this? Some new kind of an alarm clock? It doesn't seem to ring or tick at all. - Hey! It was a barometer!
Just pour in acetic acid. The more acid, the quicker the liquid rubber resents the insult, and stiffens up into an indignant mass. There. Crude rubber. Well, I can't believe it. But how does it...
I asked Dennis if you could go along, darling. He says it's an awfully rotten area, even for a man. Gary... - Yes? - Maybe I... Well...maybe I'd better go.
Cesca! - What for you take that money? - I want it, that's why. Give it back. It's bad money.
- That's the first time you've smiled. How do you mean I'm funny? You just are. What else are you doing with all your money? I hear you're getting a new car.
- Did Johnny send you up here? Johnny? How do you like this place? - Kind of gaudy, isn't it? - Ain't it?
We'll lick the whole world! Cesca! Let me lie down, Tony. I'm all hollow inside. - Cesca, what is it?
- Goodbye. Goodbye, Captain Harvey. I owe you my life and I wont forget it. Though, between you and me, it isnt worth much. - This is yours?
With me? I don't know. I haven't thought about it much. Will you? I thought I hated this country.
- Old man hyena sounds pretty lively. - Horrible noise, isn't it? Yet, I don't know. It's part of it all. - Love it, don't you?
Gaston! Read this. The description fits. That's our bag. Twenty thousand francs. If I sold it, I would get...
Neither do I. That's where I found it. I don't know how I could have lost it there. I was nowhere near that niche. Oh, that's strange. Maybe... Are you sure this is your bag?
"Saving it for the hills." Just a moment. - What'd you do with our money? - I got it in the saddlebag. You'd better give it to me.
Why, we've even gone without the necessities of life deprived ourselves of food. actually starved. But now we have our reward. We can settle down for life and live on the fat of the land. Keep your hands where they are. Hand it over.
At the proper time. I'll sing a certain song. Silence befriending, To aid us conspires Prudence attending, Vengeance inspires - You can remember it? - Yes, sir.
- You can remember it? - Yes, sir. - You're not gonna forget it? - No, sir. Do you remember it?
I do. You do? Well, I... I don't see it on you. Of course you don't. Though it's not very far from you.
Well, I... I don't see it on you. Of course you don't. Though it's not very far from you. Well... Well, let me guess where it's hidden. Is it in your bag?
Of course you don't. Though it's not very far from you. Well... Well, let me guess where it's hidden. Is it in your bag? It's much nearer to me than that.
Well... Well, let me guess where it's hidden. Is it in your bag? It's much nearer to me than that. Is it in your bodice? I know.
It's much nearer to me than that. Is it in your bodice? I know. It's hidden in the folds of your gown. - Oh, milord.
Is it in your bodice? I know. It's hidden in the folds of your gown. - Oh, milord. - ls it...? Is it very close to your fair white skin?
You're a busy man, but I must see you. Where are you? Oh. You can come in the back way, no one'll see you. If you think of it, bring some cheese. You must come over.
You're shooting your own men. - What? You're shooting your own men. Here's 5 dollars. Keep it under your hat.
I've got some luggage at the station. How can l have it sent? I'll get it dropped over tomorrow. Are you staying a bit? Yes.
You wouldn't, Kemp. It's never used now. I didn't know it was even made. It's a drug that's made from a flower that's grown in India. It draws colour from everything it touches. Years ago they tried it for bleaching cloth.
It draws colour from everything it touches. Years ago they tried it for bleaching cloth. They gave it up because it destroyed the material. - That doesn't sound very terrible. - I know, but it does something else.
- That doesn't sound very terrible. - I know, but it does something else. It was tried out on some poor animal - a dog, I believe. It was injected under the skin, and it turned the dog dead white, like a marble statue. - Is that so?
So much for you. Now then, about the bicycle. Where's the owner of the bicycle? Here, sir. It was pulled clean out of me hands, sir.
You must keep him calm and quiet for tonight. I trust you, Kemp. - Who was that, Father? - It was Kemp. It was about Jack.
I trust you, Kemp. - Who was that, Father? - It was Kemp. It was about Jack. I know it.
Well, anyway, neither beast nor man something monstrous, all-powerful. Still living still holding that island in a grip of deadly fear. Well, every legend has a basis of truth. I tell you, there's something on that island that no white man has ever seen. - And you expect to photograph it?
Still living still holding that island in a grip of deadly fear. Well, every legend has a basis of truth. I tell you, there's something on that island that no white man has ever seen. - And you expect to photograph it? - If it's there, you bet I'll photograph it.
Colossal. It might almost be Egyptian. But what's on the other side of that wall? Who do you suppose could have built it? Oh, I was up on Angkor once.
When did I ever let slip 15 thalers? To the kitchen! Imagine, in this icecap, finding someone who knows Spain. You understand I admire your country. It's rugged and strong and impressive.
There's friendship for you. The noble Waldow graciously steps aside... so that his old friend might renew his youth. Lily. Lily. Was this what you brought me down here for?
- There's a fire in the lodge! - What? There's a fire, milord. In the lodge. Fire?
- Why, that's not real fruit! It's imitation! It's made of wax! What has he been doing now? He's been eating that phoney fruit.
- Here's your long-distance call. I'll bet you can't guess who this is! Alright, who is it? It's your little brother Charlie. Well, for goodness' sake!
- I'll find out. Wait! They are probably asleep and didn't hear it. We sure were lucky. Do be careful.
Do you think a story like that could come from my mind if it wasn't the truth? It's ridiculous! - It's absurd! - It's the silliest thing I've ever heard. Well, it certainly is.
You'd better help me. They're heavy. We'll have them right out, Mr. Santee. You'll get the surprise of your life! Don't try to lift it. All you have to do is press the button in the back And it walks out by itself. Isn't it wonderful?
And I'll get out of the box, open the door and let you in. Then we'll get the mortgage. So far, so good. What is it? - I couldn't tell you.
That was a girl, not a man. Hello, Joan. Oh, is she a dream and you should see that dream walking. I'm sorry. I don't know where it is. And, now ladies and gentlemen, as I was telling... Said...
Wie geitz, my friend Or mazel tov Bon jour or any high hat stuff What a linguist! What a linguist! By now you outta know The Baron's gonna say hello! A gunna gunna A great ahorta
What? That? Oh no. Look at the measurements. Look at that. Look at that. That's the androgynous type.
I'll scream if I want to! All right, scream. Let me off this boat or I'll break every piece of furniture in here! Here, now. Have a nice piece of juicy steak.
I can't stand this any longer. In a pig's eye, you will. Listen monkey face, when you fired me, you fired the best news hound your filthy scandal sheet ever had. You wouldn't know a newspaper story if it kicked you in the pants. I got all your copy.
What's the matter, you not up yet? - What time is it? - 8:00. Here. It's a toothbrush, thanks.
Here. It's a toothbrush, thanks. My dress, you had it pressed. Come on. Breakfast will be ready soon. You sweet thing.
And I'll write a book about it. Call it "The Hitchhiker's Hail." There's no end to your accomplishments, is there? - You think it's simple? - No.
- The reward. - I'm sorry you read it. - Are you going to see him? - I suppose so. Certainly.
Julie's going to have a baby. Julie's going to have a baby! - Auntie! - What is it? When a woman... You'd know if...
You can give it a try with my fishing pole... but I can't guarantee anything. Do you... have a knife? Here, take this. Take it! - Listen...
"Number 5,673,210,109,212,003... Liliom Zadowski, here present... waives his right to return to Earth for one night." There's an error on the registration form of the man they sent down below. It's missing a stamp. It's management's fault.
Good day, sir. - We had a slight accident. - Oh really? You can fix it, can't you? No.
I'm really sorry. I didn't get it. You are a smartie. So this is your car? Okay.
You are a smartie. So this is your car? Okay. But from now on, it's mine. Get it?
Take note of this. Green Studebaker, at the Longchamp Hermitage. License plate number... 98 82 RG5. ...82 RG5. Let's get to work!
License plate number... 98 82 RG5. ...82 RG5. Let's get to work! It's a green Studebaker, at the Hermitage. The license plate number is 98 82 RG5.
The license plate number is 98 82 RG5. See how easy it is? Hurry up, for Christ's sake! It won't wait for you! Take that.
See how easy it is? Hurry up, for Christ's sake! It won't wait for you! Take that. It's a green Studebaker-- 98 92--
Great. See you in a bit. Where were we? Oh yeah... this is not a tea room. It's no tennis club either.
Do you know Marseilles? Nice place. He's being picky. In any case, you'll take that car to Marseilles. And quick.
I even wonder if he'll ever get there. I'm not superstitious, but I have a bad feeling. He likes speed and could be careless... and push that car... a little too much. Did you find it at an antique store? It was parked at the university.
Now you may punish me for my effrontery. I deserve punishment far more than you do. We must never do this again. It's disloyal to my future husband. Disloyal?
You can depend upon me, sir. - Hiya, Mr. Holt! - Hello, Edward. Where's Mr. Arlington? This is his luggage, but I think he's in his cabin.
Throw that down to me, Cheetah. Give that to me. Cheetah, that isn't funny. Throw it down to me, Cheetah. Can't you see I've got nothing on.
With Tarzan's memory. Answer me honestly, Jane. Would you feel better if we didn't take the ivory? If we carried it back? Martin, that's sweet of you... but nothing matters anymore.
It's blocked. We'll save ourselves first. Cheetah can show us the way after. Come back here, you! Pick up that ivory.
I don't want to get tough with you. I'm sure you don't want to either. Just one more question I want to ask you. Are you willing to swear to a complaint for this guy's plugging you? That's another one I can't answer now.
Come here. You're a fine watchdog. He's got more sense than you have. I'm glad you're not on this case. On it?
- What's the matter with you? - The mystery's all gone. - I was hoping you'd find out who did it. - Maybe I will. - If Wynant...
I figure it like this. Wynant went to Julia's apartment and found Morelli there. Sees she's two-timing him, there's a fight. He doesn't do anything because of Morelli. Lets his lawyer give her money to give to him so she'll think it's blown over.
He doesn't do anything because of Morelli. Lets his lawyer give her money to give to him so she'll think it's blown over. Then when she isn't expecting it, he lets her have it. - No proof? - Nothing as yet to cinch it.
I'll have to look that up. You needn't bother looking that up. I'm not going to get married, and I'm not having any children. From now on, I'm just out for the ride. I took it from her hand.
- Well, they do, don't they? - Sure. You won't get another swallow until you say. I happened to remember he had shrapnel in his shin. It bothered him.
That's the place for him when the trouble starts. And the little friend of Nunheim's, the frying-pan juggler, there. Nick, are you sure one of these people is the killer? Positive. Nick, I can't stand the suspense.
We're here because I have some very important news. What is it? Just this. Clyde Wynant did not kill Julia. He didn't kill Nunheim or anyone. What are you talking about?
When you're strong enough, we'll go away and forget this horrible experience. Forget? If only I could forget. But it's never out of my mind. I've been cursed for delving into the mysteries of life. Perhaps death is sacred, and I've profaned it.
Where, I ask you? Where will she be? A thousand crowns. It's beating perfectly. Just as in life.
Where will she be? A thousand crowns. It's beating perfectly. Just as in life. - Oh, if only I can keep it going until...
A thousand crowns. It's beating perfectly. Just as in life. - Oh, if only I can keep it going until... - It was a very fresh one.
What would you like done with him, Miss Bishop? Why, I don't know. You're extremely foolish. It might have cost you your life. It was fortunate for you that I was here to save you.
I told Nuttall we'd get to the boat by midnight. Jeremy, we must not fail tonight. What the devil have you been up to? Tonight will be a fine night, judging by the sky. There you are, Pitt.
Look at this beautiful grape. Here you go! Isn't she lovely! She swore she won't do it again. You won't do it again?
- Mr. Morrison, pipe the men. Change the boat crews. Dive in with your mess, lads. The boats are alongside. Mr. Byam, look at this bit of meat, sir. It's alive.
- I can't tell her that. - I mean it, Roger. But it's a dream, Fletcher. This island isn't real for you and me. It's the ship that's real.
A joke at the right moment. A glass of grog. A kind word would do more with seamen than the cat-o'-nine-tails. And this ship will be the worse if possible, for his death. Wonder if that's Defoe Island.
Oh, good morning, lad. Mr. Fryer, you say I was armed with a bayonet. - Did you see me use it? - By no means, lad. Address your replies to the court. Milord, he didn't use the bayonet.
- And you, Mr. Driftwood? - I'll join up with you later. Listen, Gottlieb, nix on the lovemaking, because I saw Mrs. Claypool first. Of course, her mother really saw her first, but why bring the Civil War into this? What are you doing in my costume?
- Sure, those five kids up in Canada. I wouldn't know about that. I haven't been in Canada in years. Go ahead and read it. - What does it say?
I wouldn't know about that. I haven't been in Canada in years. Go ahead and read it. - What does it say? - Go on and read it.
I haven't been in Canada in years. Go ahead and read it. - What does it say? - Go on and read it. - You read it.
Let's hear it again. "The party of the first part shall be known in this contract... "as the party of the first part." Sounds a little better this time. It grows on you.
Get out! Get out! -Good morning. I wonder if you'II do me a favor. I have a joint account with my husband and I'd Iike to fix it that nobody can draw the money out but me.
May charm awhile Hearts which are brightest And eyes that smile Lisa! Get off my train!
And it had better be the same with you. Now, I'm speaking to you as a sister to a sister. That's right. Now, that's... Let's get inside.
Lock me in. Don't open that door before sunrise. Even if I call, pay no attention to it. Keep that door locked till dawn. Good night.
Keep that door locked till dawn. Good night. There it is, Paul. You can just see it through the trees. Dear old Falden.
Off you go. Six, seven, eight, nine, ten. I've won! So you've seen this monster before? Yes.
I've won! So you've seen this monster before? Yes. There was something grotesquely familiar about it. Then it suddenly struck me.
- I didn't know you were married. - Yes, I'm married. Nick, what'll I do? I know I had it. Don't worry, darling.
We are tendering this little surprise party for the... Will you keep out of the kitchen? We are busy. Where'll I put this ice? - Lay it down and don't bother me.
Give it to me. Yes. All right. We'll come. Nickie, I'm sorry.
I'm going to get my things. We're going to celebrate! We'll start the New Year right. - What is it, Henry? The telephone?
It's his wife. See? - Have you made up your mind? - All right, I'll give you the money. Tonight?
Just a minute. That's a lot of money. How do I know you'll keep your promise? How do I know you'll really stay away? And, even if... Selma does decide to get a divorce, how do I know you won't fight it?
Lights went out. You want me to stand out there while Nick might be in trouble? - What was the shooting? - I guess it was me. Did you get him?
- It's there next to the salt. - Thanks. Then, what? - Yes, I mean it. - Of course you're right.
- Thanks. Then, what? - Yes, I mean it. - Of course you're right. She didn't do it.
- If we found out who took this place... - I took this. - You took what? - I took this picture. I found it in Pedro's apartment.
You know, that check of Robert's for $20,000 was a forgery. - So, what's it to me? - It was traced from another check. I still say, so what's it to me? Just a minute, Lieutenant.
Ask him why he threw your gun away, Selma. He knew that it hadn't been fired. You'd only have to show it to prove your innocence. Yet he threw it away. Ask him why.
Then we'll button this up to protect your little neck. So you won't get cold. Do you know that you've got a nice voice? I had a much nicer voice till I ran a nail through it... You ran a nail through it! Let me hear you sing that again.
Take my offer to your commandant. The decision is his. If my terms are acceptable, instruct your colonel to raise the white flag. You should know the British never surrender. Yet their guns will be useless to them, if I may advise Your Highness. I suspected you had a plan. If Colonel Campbell accepts our terms and he would be exceedingly unwise not to it would be very simple.
Four-and-a-half years of work, madame. Every pearl is matched and flawless. Believe me, madame, even at that price... I am not in the habit of bargaining when I see something I want. And I want this necklace.
Naturally. Of course. 2,200,000 francs. Tell me, M. Duvalle, exactly how did you arrive at this figure? Dr. Pauquet, I can show you my books.
- Not a thing. Socks. 100 pesetas fine. There's something wrong with my car. I wonder if you can help me.
I'm getting gooseflesh. I wish you would hurry. I'll be through in a second. Don't you like it? Of course.
I wish you would hurry. I'll be through in a second. Don't you like it? Of course. But do you think it goes with those trousers?
I paid you a few compliments. I told you how charming and how lovely you were and I'd still repeat it, but I didn't do anything. But you intended to. I did not. You had it in your eye.
It's gone. Where is it? In my stomach? That's what you think. It isn't. It's in the inside pocket of your coat and it isn't chicken anymore.
It's in the inside pocket of your coat and it isn't chicken anymore. It's changed into a string of pearls. You know, that's marvellous. I can scarcely believe it. But you're right. It is in my inside pocket.
We came to see you about the pearl necklace. Pearl necklace? Do you intend to buy another one? On the contrary. You see, the necklace that you sold mademoiselle is really very beautiful but too expensive for us, and I'm afraid we'll have to return it.
Do you intend to buy another one? On the contrary. You see, the necklace that you sold mademoiselle is really very beautiful but too expensive for us, and I'm afraid we'll have to return it. - You have it with you, dear? - Yes, darling.
On the contrary. You see, the necklace that you sold mademoiselle is really very beautiful but too expensive for us, and I'm afraid we'll have to return it. - You have it with you, dear? - Yes, darling. Would it upset you too much if I would ask you to take it back?
Sandor, look at me. What do you see in my eyes? Death. Hurry. Hurry, it's almost daylight.
I wonder what sort of telegrams we'll get when it's known that Wilson was an innocent man. Well, when I gave out the statement I didn't know that. This story is on every wire in the world right now. Yeah, yeah. Now he's innocent. Yeah.
I'll give them the chance they didn't give me. They'll get a legal trial in a legal courtroom. They'll have a legal judge and a legal defense. They'll get a legal sentence and a legal death. But I can't do it myself. You'll have to do it for me. You see that? I tore it out of a law book.
They'll have a legal judge and a legal defense. They'll get a legal sentence and a legal death. But I can't do it myself. You'll have to do it for me. You see that? I tore it out of a law book. My husband says it would be a blessing if the community would forget what happened.
Nobody knew it, so I was keeping it for a mement... Memento. But it is upsetting my conscience. I don't dare sign this, or I would probably get lynched myself. A citizen of Strand." I now draw your attention to this ring.
Yes. Come. Hello, Ferryman! Hello! The shortest road to the village is over the moor.
A guy that will beat anybody in the world... from Gandhi to Garbo. Bill Chandler. Bill Chandler? Yes. Now, you fired him, the best man we ever had on libel. - You admit it, and you fired him.
Goodbye. Good luck to you. - Take his arm. - I'm taking your arm. Yes.
Would you open it for me, honeykins? Bill. - What is it? - Read it. - What does it say?
- Low and close. Bull's eye! Give the gentleman a cigar. I don't quite seem to get it. It's your wrist, sir.
Stop turning my head. Now, for the purpose of the record, what time will you arrive at the bazaar? Once and for all, I am not attending the bazaar. Bill, what is it? What is it?
They've even met the woman. No. I don't believe it. I won't. Now, Connie, please.
Now come along... What about this? - It's nothing, Bill. - Yes, what about this? I can explain that thing.
The smartest thing I did was to make that trip. - Did you get? - No, but I will get the power of attorney. I asked him what he was going to do with the money. Know what he said?
The treasurer reports a deficit of $180,000 for the current year. A deficit? We lost that much? You see, Mr Deeds, the opera is not conducted for profit. - It isn't? What is it conducted for?
Grant's tomb. I hope you're not disappointed. - It's wonderful. - To most people it's an awful let-down. Huh?
- Really? - Probably as small as Mandrake Falls. - What do you know about that! It's a beautiful little town, too. Grove poplar trees right along main street.
You know what I've been doin' since I got home? I've been workin' on a poem. It's about you. Sometimes it's kind of hard for me to say things, so I write 'em. I'd like to read it sometime.
A smaller bowl. - Did you get that stuff? - Stuff, sir? - That goo that tastes like soap. Yes, sir.
Now everything is on the up and up. - lsn't that swell? - One thing I want you to promise. - What? - Don't come and ask any of it back. You listen to this - when we make an agreement, it is an agreement.
Don't be afraid. - I got something for ya. Look. I got some presents for ya. See? See the pretty feather? Sure. Sure.
Hickok, white man friend, speak with forked tongue. Now, you tell, which way soldier take bullet? Bill, what's in that watch? Bill! Bill, you got my picture. You kept it.
You might begin by taking that piece of lettuce off your necktie. One, two, three. Let's try it again from the beginning. - I'm getting it, aren't I? - Yes.
Miss Carrol, I want to show Mr. Gordon how much you just taught me. No, never mind. Thank you. That's very sweet of you. I'm anxious for Mr. Gordon to see this. It's an interesting experiment. How did you say that last step went?
It's funny how we met, and all that's happened to us since. The way we've been sort of thrown together and everything. As if it were all meant to happen. It's quite an experience. It's more than an experience.
- Bugs. The second half he left to Jane, providing she was alive and could be induced to return to civilization. Otherwise, the bugs get the whole million. And if you succeed in bringing this good news to your cousin you hope to profit to some extent. Well, I've staked every penny I've got on it.
It feels like a brief. Darling, I hope they don't ask you to .. That's too bad. ─ What? My assistant, Bailey, had his appendix out last night.
You see that neck? See the blood oozing through the cut in the glove worn by the murderer Left a distinct mark on the woman's throat. That thin line of blood indicating an almost vertical cut. It matches completely the cut on your hand, Lewis. Why, the wound on Dearden's hand is an inch shorter and horizontal. That evidence is going to hang you, Lewis. Unless it was self-defence.
Aren't you afraid you're not strong enough yet? Oh, I'm afraid of nothing except being bored. - It's supper after the theater. - Thank you, I'll come with pleasure. And bring this book as a present.
- I could use some of the principal. - You will do nothing of the sort. Your grandfather's legacy mustn't be touched. However, I have a few thousand francs I can spare. - You mean, you'll give me the money?
- She has some good reason, monsieur. - Yes, I'm sure of that. Oh, there you are. Isn't it the most beautiful day? Is it so beautiful?
Armand wins again. He drew nine three times. Well done, well done. Let it stand. - You'll lose it all.
You don't want to lose your rich admirer. I understand. Your own fortunes would fall with him. Armand, he's not to blame for what happened. That I swear. Then how could you do what you did? I'll tell you. Because your heart is a thing that can be bought and sold.
You see this woman? You know her? Then listen to what I'm going to say. I accepted her favors because I thought she loved me. I let her make sacrifices when there were others who had more to give. But bear witness, I owe her nothing.
You know her? Then listen to what I'm going to say. I accepted her favors because I thought she loved me. I let her make sacrifices when there were others who had more to give. But bear witness, I owe her nothing. Take it.
Mr Halton. Why do you want to know her name? Because I'm dining with her at a quarter to nine. You are a friend of Captain Buckler's. What a lovely song.
Because I'm dining with her at a quarter to nine. You are a friend of Captain Buckler's. What a lovely song. What's the name of it? It has no name.
- Oh, Graham. - At this time of the night? Why? - A telegram. - Was it so important? - I didn't open it, it was for you.
Hm. - What's that? - Oh... Just... just something I made up. That's nice.
- Oh, you must finish it. It's not so easy. Well, I don't know. The beginning is so beautiful, I wonder if the end matters. It's an old tune, but it's still good.
Hm. I don't remember the name or how we got there. - All I remember is... - It was glorious, wasn't it? - And what a hotel.
- It was glorious, wasn't it? - And what a hotel. - Let's forget it. Oh! Oh, no.
- You're going to the opera, sir? - Yes, that's where I'm going. If I may say so, sir, my favourite opera is Cavelleria Rusticana. It's only one act, but it has everything. Love, jealousy, hate, murder, and all in 35 minutes.
Thanks. You know, I've been thinking about you a great deal. Now, I hope that little story of mine hasn't worried you. It's an unusual story. I shouldn't mind reading it in a novel.
And I'm afraid you are a man in love. I don't know. It may be more than love, or less than love. Well, man, make up your mind. What is it?
I don't know. It may be more than love, or less than love. Well, man, make up your mind. What is it? It's...
- You must be very happy, Lady Barker. - I am. Don't be afraid. I won't play it. I shall never play it.
- Oh, good. By the way, I'm going to Geneva. - Didn't you tell me Mr Hamilton is going? - I've changed my mind. Oh, I thought it was only a sub-committee meeting.
- Very much. He said she had blonde hair, blue eyes, my figure and a slight foreign accent. Sounds like a description of you. It does, doesn't it? It annoyed me that there should be another woman who looks exactly like me.
Yes, you just thought that if I'd stay up there... you'd show me exactly how innocent a night in the country can be, didn't you? Are you still harping on that same old string? It doesn't matter to me whether you go or stay. I was just trying to make it easier for you, that's all. Did you have to throw that gadget away?
It seems, my dear friend, we shall soon become related, don't you think? I would be most honoured, Your Excellency. And I would be most happy, dear baron. Because I would not be who I am today were it not for you. - I will never forget that.
And I would be most happy, dear baron. Because I would not be who I am today were it not for you. - I will never forget that. - I did it for my country. Besides...
Who are you calling a sissy? I'll take care of it. Did you say I was a sissy? I said some people might think eating off of trays was sissy. Well, let's get something to eat anyway, huh, Harvey?
Did you say I was a sissy? I said some people might think eating off of trays was sissy. Well, let's get something to eat anyway, huh, Harvey? You heard me order it. Go ahead, Charles.
Move. This isn't the way my Treasure Island looks. It's the very first way anybody ever saw Treasure Island. Gee, it's very valuable, huh? Sure.
He says if we don't let him and Pogey Williams and Alvin Savage... join the Buffaloes... - I'll have to leave school. - What? I don't know what to do with this. He gave it to me.
I was going to tell you it was from me. I thought maybe you'd make the history exam easier. You went to the dentist and came back late, and I didn't get a chance to tell you. - I had no idea it was from you. - You kept it, though.
I know what he said, sir. Persons in Coventry do not speak after a class is dismissed. Kind of funny about Eddie stopping where he did. Yes. Yes, it was.
But he's rich. He can buy more fish than you ever saw. Why, he owns the boat I fell off. - You mean the liner? - Yes, he practically owns it.
Where you learn all this? I read a book on it in Capt. Disko's cabin, and I don't care who knows it. And you can go row your old boat all by yourself. I wouldn't go out in it for anything. By golly, that's smart kid.
You're not going. We'll save you. We have good times together, eh, little fish? We laugh, we sing, so you smile now. Come on, smile.
- You have nothing to worry about. The last patient I gave one of those to won the Kentucky Derby. May I examine this, please? Do you actually give those to your patients? Isn't that awfully large for a pill?
- All right. Don't hurry. I've got it someplace. I know it's someplace. Here.
Let me look at you, huh? No. Don't look at me. What do you think I am, a peepshow? Get away there, will you? It's rather a strange-looking sight.
Dr. Hackenbush he's got apple dumpling. No apple dumpling. No, it's no apple dumpling. No. No.
Well, Morgan, you got nothing to worry about. Hi Hat's not on this track. See he doesn't get on. Put a man at every gate. If that nag slips by you, it means your job. Here. Keep me posted.
To escape. What do you dig with? With a coal shovel, old cans... We should come up in a garden... behind those buildings... It's open country. Slow work.
We may be superfluous. And don't you find it a pity? Perhaps... I admire your care of your geranium. Not because I have turned botanist.
Well, it's the same party. What? A party three days and three nights? That's splendido, splendido, magnifico! It isn't a party.
[BELL RINGS] Ward. Nick, stop them. It's awful. Please stop them.
- All right, all right. - Come on. So you don't get indigestion. Turkey Morgan's been shooting his mouth off to get Kid Galahad into an early match. You birds said it would draw a million-dollar gate.
Pull another fast one? If I wanted to take the title away from you, I wouldn't spend 50 grand to do it. I'm dumping my fighter. The more McGraw cracks him up, the better I'll like it. The old wheeze that he double-crossed you, eh?
At a longest, it'll be over in an hour. I know, but I'm afraid Nick will get back at him. Not while there's a chance of getting that title from McGraw and Morgan. - You don't think so? - No, I'm sure of it.
We can't meet those nations without Conway. This can't be kidnapping. They wouldn't be taking us so far on such a dangerous trip. No sense to it. What do you make of it, Bob? You must have some idea.
Chang's first question was about the pilot. There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. What reason could they have for doing a thing like that? That's what's on the other side of the hill.
- That must have taken... - Centuries. Centuries. Where did you get the money to pay for all these treasures? We have no money as you know it.
- You've read my books? You do more things. What have my books got to do with it? I saw a man whose life was empty. "A man whose life was empty. "
With the same amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why? Maybe 'cause you've always been part of Shangri-La without knowing it. - I wonder.
Things like that don't happen today. - We're living in the 20th century. - You think it's nonsense? You've been hypnotised by fanatics. I wouldn't believe it in England.
That's what I call fortitude. - Think of it. - Tell me something, Gainsford. What do you think of his talk about Shangri-La? Do you believe it? Yes. I believe it.
And you believed them? -Yes! How long have you known these two lords? -Not long at all. We met them here on the train. And who did you tell them you were? Spit it out!
-Yes. Here. Thank you. is it him? -Obviously it is... not!
I would have rather told you something nicer, you can believe me. But you would have found out about it at some point, and then it wouldn't have been so easy to give it all up. Give it all up? -Of course! Or don't you understand it yet? -No, I understand everything perfectly.
-Excuse me, court ofjustice. The facts! We are accused of having pretended to be Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. We didn't do that a single time! Quite the contrary, we contradicted it, right Macky? We denied and repudiated.
- It's after us. - Don't let it out. Hold it shut. - Now's our chance. Get it now! - Quick! - Give it to it! Don't let it get away! Hold on there.
- Now's our chance. Get it now! - Quick! - Give it to it! Don't let it get away! Hold on there. It's only Dopey.
- Quick! - Give it to it! Don't let it get away! Hold on there. It's only Dopey. - Did you see it?
- Give it to it! Don't let it get away! Hold on there. It's only Dopey. - Did you see it? - How big is it?
Hold on there. It's only Dopey. - Did you see it? - How big is it? - Was it a dragon?
It's only Dopey. - Did you see it? - How big is it? - Was it a dragon? - Has it got horns?
- Was it breathing fire? - Was it droolin'? What was it doin'? He says it's a, a monster asleep in our beds! - Let's attack.
- Was it droolin'? What was it doin'? He says it's a, a monster asleep in our beds! - Let's attack. - While it's sleeping.
- While it's sleeping. Yeah, while it's sleeping. - Hurry, men. It's now or never! - Off with its head. - Break its bones. - Chop it to pieces.
- Off with its head. - Break its bones. - Chop it to pieces. We'll kill it dead. - Jiminy Crickets! - Gosh! - Gee! - What a monster!
We'll kill it dead. - Jiminy Crickets! - Gosh! - Gee! - What a monster! It covers three beds.
Casey, you're a fool. I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Topper, to have caused you this embarrassment. I... I hope you'll accept my apology. Oh, but think nothing of it. Promise me you'll think nothing of it.
Father, what is it she feels for him? Is it love? Pity? I've a faint suspicion it's more than pity. What a nest for a honeymoon.
Oh, kid. The bottom has dropped out of everything. Darling, what's happened? Read this. What's this got to do with you?
Hello? Give me the hospital, quick. Alright, bring him to the hospital, immediately. Prepare for a transfusion. Will it be necessary to postpone the execution?
You've all suffered from their cruelty. The ear loppings, the beatings the blindings with hot irons, the burning of our homes the mistreatment of our women. It's time we put an end to this! - Robin's right. - Aye! Now, this forest is wide.
We'll have to see him through. Prepare final flight. Does my lady find it interesting? Lady Marian? - Oh, I'm sorry.
- Do you want to send a message? - To his men, yes. Well, my lady, I have had a nip of ale of a night, just now and again at a place in the town and I won't deny as some of the others were there. Where was it? Oh, Bess, please tell me!
Tell me, when you are in love, is it well, is it hard to think of anybody but one person? Yes, indeed, and sometimes there's a bit of trouble sleeping. I know, but it's a nice kind of not sleeping. Yes, and it affects your appetite too. Not that I've noticed it's done that to you, except when he was waiting to be hanged.
The next time we're escorted by an officer we'll probably both be wearing handcuffs. RANDOLPH: A blood pressure on yourself? - Yes. Unfortunate that interruption in Mrs. Updyke's boudoir would have been a perfect moment for a blood pressure during the robbery.
- Sure. Why not? He can stand another pinch but not me. I'm too hot. - Never mind the alibis. Where's the stuff? - We never laid eyes on it, Jo. The papers carry a big story of what's missing.
- Right down there, professor. - Well, so far so good. This loft has been cleaned out perfectly. How about it, Rocks? You got it?
For an exhaustive scientific work on criminology. - All about them jobs we pulled? - Yes. They're covered extensively. - Suppose the cops get hold of this book? - It's very unlikely.
It all depends what kind of headache it is, the cause. How's paradol? Paradol chloride isn't effective for headaches, if that's what you mean. What's it used for? Well, chiefly insomnia, in minute doses.
It's a sedative. And a poison. - Got any? - Why, certainly. Every doctor has. May I see it?
So obsessed, that he could commit murder. Yes, but his hand was forced. Clitterhouse, are you stating a hypothetical case or has all this actually happened? - Assume that it has happened. - Well?
The hundred grand? I had it for you, only as I said, I didn't expect-- -I know. You said it before. -You don't have to worry about it. -I'm not worried.
-Yeah. That was the idea, wasn't it? I took the rap, three years. You took the dough, made connections built it up. For you and me.
But he tried to give me a lot more than he could get driving a cab. Partly my fault. I didn't stop him. Well, he got in deeper and deeper. One night, he tried to shoot it out with the cops.
That'll give you time to get to the bank. Take $ 100,000 out of my personal account and give it to him. What's up? Is he holding you? -Tell him yes. -Yes.
Because I'm not a mug. I'm smart, see. Sure, you'd like rough stuff. Why, when you can do it nice and legal? No trouble, no fuss.
A hundred? How come? It's twice as much as I got. -You wanna make something out of it? -No. No.
-No. No. He deserves it. Why you starting trouble? You pull in your ears. What are we gonna do with it?
-What's it all about? -You've got a great poker face, Rocky. But don't forget, I've known that face for a long time. I know you forced Frazier to get you $ 100,000. Everybody knows it. What's the difference where the dough came from?
-You've got a great poker face, Rocky. But don't forget, I've known that face for a long time. I know you forced Frazier to get you $ 100,000. Everybody knows it. What's the difference where the dough came from? First place, Frazier owed it to me. It's mine.
Rice. Rice? Sure. Don't you use it over here? Why, of course we do, for puddings. Oh, we use it for weddings.
Will you step in, please? Yes, Father? Nicole. What happened? You bought it?
Where's your mother, Skinny? Come on. We'll see what we can do. Mr. Morris, do you know who broke your window? - Yes, Your Honor. - Pardon me, but does it really matter? It was a free-for-all.
- Stop talking and take out the pin. Oh, my, this is so silly. Of course. Do you think it would roll if it were square? I have reference to a mark on the ball. That proves it's a CrowFlight. That's mine.
No, everything is not all Everything is not all right, Susan. Maybe for you, but I've got to get to New York. Now one thing's settled, you start worrying about something else. One of us should worry! On top of all this, we've stolen a car!
Everything is not all right, Susan. Maybe for you, but I've got to get to New York. Now one thing's settled, you start worrying about something else. One of us should worry! On top of all this, we've stolen a car! That's all right. I'll send it back. I don't like it, anyway.
- Let me see now, what month is this? - June. June? It would go something like this. I'll just prepare for it. Now, let me see.
Ever since I came into the house there's been something wrong. - Elizabeth... - It's been bedlam! - Don't you think it's time we went inside? - No. We've only just left it. But don't you think it's a good idea to go back? No, I think it's a good idea to continue our walk.
And yet, I am terribly anxious. I asked you to leave. Yes, sir. Terribly anxious because I am sure Sorgues was hypnotized. Someone here has the evil eye.
We know nothing. Fine. I was counting on your honesty, your loyalty... I see I was mistaken. I swear, Sorgues said nothing.
Julia, seriously, what is all this? I told you, where I live. I wrote it down on the back of an envelope for you. But it's enormous. I'm overcome.
Come on, Neddie. Neddie, play it. Play it, Neddie. Johnny and I can bear it. Can't we?
Mother had Linda straight off to oblige him. Linda was a girl, so she promptly had Julia. Julia was a girl and it seemed hopeless. The next year Mother had me and there was much joy in the land. It was a boy and the fair name of Seton would flourish.
- Yes, we've had quite a long walk. - This is a shame, it really is. I was going to give a party tonight. I had it all planned. I was going to....
- This is a shame, it really is. I was going to give a party tonight. I had it all planned. I was going to.... Well, it was a good idea.
He never puts the cap back on the toothpaste. Then we'll drink a toast to Johnny. He needs it. Needs it? No, I'm wrong.
It's been my idea to make a few thousands early in the game and then quit for as long as it lasts and try to find out who I am and what goes on now, while I'm young and feel good all the time. I'm sure Julia understands what I'm getting at, don't you, Julia? I'm not sure I do, Johnny. You wish to occupy yourself otherwise, is that it? Please don't make me feel guilty about it.
I'm sure Julia understands what I'm getting at, don't you, Julia? I'm not sure I do, Johnny. You wish to occupy yourself otherwise, is that it? Please don't make me feel guilty about it. Even if it is a fool idea that people dream about and then go flat on.
He'll be up in a minute. Are you sure you want to get over him? No, I'm not and that's what scares me most. I feel alive and I love it. I feel at last something's happening to me.
Compromise? Yes. Yes. You think that's right, don't you? - I don't think it matters a bit what I think.
For love, true love, is a very rare and beautiful thing. Where are you going? Please, sit down. And I believe that its path that is to say the course of true love, contrary to the adage, should run smooth. I am a man of 58 years and speak from a long experience and observation.
It is of paramount importance-- - I beg your pardon, sir? - Yes? If that position at the bank is still open I'll be glad to take it. I'm still not convinced.
To Madame Poulard's. - Julie, it's perfectly lovely. - I don't like the color. And does it have to be so tight here? - It binds. And the skirt...
I aim to carry all I can hold, and I advise you gentlemen to do likewise. Huger aims not to be carried off by anything but drink. It's no joking matter. Looks mighty serious. More cases than you hear about.
I guess it's pretty serious. Pres Dillard's coming home on account of it. Pres is coming home. Of course. Did you know it?
Stopping everybody coming from the city. It's mighty bad in the city, mighty bad. - We're all very fortunate to be up here. - Are any gentlefolk taken down? Major Crandall's dead with it, for one.
- We're all very fortunate to be up here. - Are any gentlefolk taken down? Major Crandall's dead with it, for one. Ned Warrington's got it. No telling how many others.
But I suppose his bank comes first. You don't find that admirable? Oh, admirable, I suppose. It just seems to me there are other things more interesting. I imagine Buck finds it so.
I just kind of squinched through the cane by the bayou. - You swam the bayou? - No, ma'am, Miss Julie. I scared of them gators. I just kind of found me a double-end boat. It ain't like I stealing, Miss Julie.
-With a three quarter coat. -With a scarf. That's right. I saw her when you passed the compartment. I knew I was right. But your husband said he didn't see her. He didn't notice, but as soon as he mentioned it, I remembered at once. You win. This calls for action.
-Sorry, nothing doing. -lsn't there anything we can do? -Yes, find Miss Froy. If she does not rest I will not answer for her. It will be best if you persuade her. She likes you. I'm as popular as a dose of strychnine.
It's all right, it's just my legs. Or as they say in English, jolly good luck to them. I'm glad that's over. Heaven knows what the government will say about it. -Nothing at all.
I sell cut-price trinkets. Nobody asked you what you did. There's some rainwater outside in the bucket. As you wish. Are you an artist? I wish I was. I love the arts.
He worked hard to feed me and gave me spending money. And I spoke to him insolently with my lofty pretentiousness and stupidity. I was ashamed of the grocery. The grocery should've been ashamed of me. Come on, it's not such a drama.
Here's what I need for tomorrow. Three monkeys. Peculiar music-box. Sealskin kayak. Orange-blossom crown. Worm in a jar. Veterinary syringe. I'm thinking of it now. I'll dream of it. By noon tomorrow, I'll have found, rented or bought it all.
If he agrees to debase himself, he is even greater for it. Because he sacrifices pride to lighten our loads. We should call them Saint Molière and Saint Charlie! But laughter itself. It's an absurd, vulgar convulsion. Don't speak ill of laughter.
Well, I delivered all the candy. Where's my beautiful wife? Oh, lordy! Here's a new one, Ed. Taste it.
Did you hear about it, Grandpa? We maybe all have to move. Who said so? Everyone's talking about it. Somebody's buying up everything here.
It's hers. It's never left here. She hasn't either. I can still hear the tinkle of her thin little voice and see her eyes laughing. That's the reason I've lived in this house so many years and could never move out.
And, Mother. Do you know why Mother writes plays? She likes literature and good books. No, because eight years ago, a typewriter was delivered to the house by mistake. If it had been a plough, she'd have taken up farming, huh?
Want to learn to do the Big Apple? - That's against the law, you know? - So is necking. - How much is it? - Ten cents.
- It's going up. It's all over my body now. - Please don't. It's in my throat. It's fighting to get out.
It's all over my body now. - Please don't. It's in my throat. It's fighting to get out. I can't hold it back any longer.
Tell Donald to get a dozen more and an extra can of corn. - See if Rheba has enough sauerkraut. - All right. - Tell Donald to hurry. - Yes.
So, you're the one that's been holding up my deal? - Yes. Kind of funny, isn't it? - What's funny about it? The idea of you engineering this thing and being caught in your own trap.
"I know now the situation between Tony and me is impossible. "Mrs. Kirby was right. I should have stayed in my own backyard. "Don't worry about me, Mother. I'll get over it. "But, my darlings, I'm so lonesome for you.
Let's see, what shall we play? Do you know Polly Wolly Doodle? - You ought to know it. - Polly Wolly Doodle? We drove you almost crazy with it once.
Do you know Polly Wolly Doodle? - You ought to know it. - Polly Wolly Doodle? We drove you almost crazy with it once. You know it, of course you do.
Are you the man who sold me this thing? Yes, mam. You told me it opened cans. Lady, that ain't the half of it. This little thing is one of the wonders of the ages. It's a screwdriver, a bottle opener, a cheese slicer, ice pick and vegetable parer.
Mr. Morris, look. I wanna thank you, see. When anyone asks me now where I worked last, I don't turn around and walk out. You're supposed to be a very dangerous character. They told me that a man with your record would never go straight. I'm glad that you proved them wrong. Keep it up, kid.
I was just thinking I didn't know anything about you before and... And what, Joe? Well, I get crazy when I think there was another guy, maybe, or... or something, or... Well... Let's skip it, huh?
We didn't know who he was. But we got it over the grapevine. A bigshot was coming up. And the screws wouldn't answer no questions. And then, after lights out... Yeah...
Didn't she tell you? I know a babe that roomed in the same cell with her. You mean you didn't know it? She's been making a sap out of you all this time? I didn't say nothing, Joe.
"Star of Delhi will never reach the Tower of London." Curious, and anonymous. And what is the Star of Delhi? Probably the largest emerald in the world, a gift to her majesty from the Maharajah of Rapur. Oh, I shouldn't worry about this, Sir Ronald.
That means it was torn off within the last few hours. Ah. What have you found, Holmes? It's a watch fob. Looks like a rabbit's foot. No, no, no.
- About life. Life. - Who's life? - Now, Nickie, this is important. This is your responsibility.
Well, here's the knife. - That's the one that was used, all right. - Could be the one that was tossed at me. Not much chance of fingerprints... after the dog's been playing with it for nobody knows how long. I'm apologizing.
Maybe Father was right about Dudley, and I wouldn't listen to him. Oh, poor Father. All right. - Well, I guess that does it. - Does what?
I just wanted someone to keep an eye on Nickie. - Let me. - That's very nice, but I... - Lois should get some sleep anyway. - Well, thank you very much.
- I'll get those, Nickie. - Thank you, Mommy. A glass of water. - I'll get it. No, Mrs. Bellam, you stay here.
Guild says this woman was the one at Chestevere Apartments. I'm afraid for once the Lieutenant is wrong. She wasn't. Look, Nickie, it's smoking. It worked. Give me that rod.
So you shot him as he stood on that ledge and threw the gun out your window. You're right about Linda Mills and all the other things. I got sick of playing Little Red Riding Hood to that old guy. When Phil was trying to get money out of him... I found we spoke the same language. I'm not sorry for it.
I don't know you're there. Now, I take out my money. I count it. What happens? Punchy, what's the matter for you?
You no find it? It's not in here either. Santa Claus, it looks like a white Christmas. If he wakes up, I pity us. Here, hold that.
Couldn't do better, son. Gosh, I bet you've killed a lot of men in the course of duty. - Get goin', son. I'll be right with ya. - How 'bout me handling it?
- Apologize for what? For not knowin' who's the real boss of Bottleneck. - My coffee, Clara. - Don't let me interfere with your dinner, ma'am. It's breakfast. Breakfast, huh?
Look! Isn't that lovely? You should've seen the parasol that came with it. - About the size of a pie. - Ohh! It must've been darling. Make the most of it today.
That's right! Would I go under the ground? No, there's no future in it! - Miss Frenchy, honey, you know that blue dress? Well, you can't wear it no more. It's got beer on it.
- That's the idea of the song: Get me a free drink. - I sorta gathered that. - You liked it, huh? - Yeah, it was all right!
- [Chuckling] Let's have the money. - First sign the receipt. - What? - That is, if you don't mind. Please? - It's a mighty fine thing when a man realizes he's wrong... and tries to correct it in a nice way.
You must be hungry. I'll get you something to eat. Well, how about a nice cold drink? That's great. It will just put me in the mood.
It's the very last of my father's fine Madeira. He got it from his uncle Admiral Will Hamilton of Savannah who married his cousin Jessica Carroll of Carrolton who was his second cousin and akin to the Wilkeses too. I saved it to wish Ashley a merry Christmas. But you mustn't drink it all at once, because it is the last. I meant it, my dear.
I'll think about that tomorrow. GERALD: Katie Scarlett! It's over! It's over!
She's the only thing I hate worse than Tara! It's all my fault. I should've committed robbery to get that tax money for you. I couldn't let you do anything like that. Anyway, it's done now.
I'm glad Mother's dead. I'm glad she's dead so she can't see me. I always wanted to be like her, calm and kind and sadly, I've turned out disappointing. You know, Scarlett, I think you're on the verge of a crying jag. So I'll change the subject and say what I came to say. Say it, then, and get out!
You can go. I don't care if you never come back. But I will come back. What are you thinking about, Scarlett? I'm thinking about how rich we are. I can keep the lumber business too?
RHETT: Wake up. Wake up! You were having another nightmare. Rhett, I was so cold and hungry and so tired.
Grip tightly with your legs. Lean forward and go with him. Hold your reins properly in a firm hand. Up! That was fine.
Indeed. And who's the happy father? You know it's yours. I don't want it any more than you do. No woman would want the child of a cad like you.
Rhett.... I want Rhett! What's the matter, honey? Did you call somebody, child? It's no use.
I hoped that you'd call for me. But you didn't. I wanted you. I wanted you desperately but I didn't think you wanted me. It seems we've been at cross purposes, doesn't it?
- Do you lose your cap often? - That's a silly question. - Give that to me! It's awfully dusty, sir. I'll see to it for you, sir.
Look, there it is. There. - Look, over there. - It's a cloud. - Searchlight's got it.
About fifty yards from where Sir Charles fell dead were footprints. A man's or woman's? Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound! A hound? Why didn't you report it? Not a soul would have believed it.
But I saw them. As clearly as I see you and then a few days ago as one of the executors of the estate I found this: This old document. Legend of the hound of the Baskervilles. Let me read it to you, Mr. Holmes.
What is it? Come quickly someone's prowling around. What are you doing, Barryman. Oh, nothing sir, it was the window. The window?
Yes, sir I was just seeing that it was fastened. What does it matter whether it is fastened or not? A window on the second floor. I go around every night seeing that they are fastened. Sir Charles always insisted upon it. Well that sounds reasonable enough.
Just as I thought. Barryman was signalling someone. Come on get some clothes we'll find out. It's still there. Yes
Do you see those bright green spots over there? It seems a little more fertile than the rest. Fertile? That's the great Grimpen mire. One false step means death While only yesterday one of the moor ponies wondered into it.
One false step means death While only yesterday one of the moor ponies wondered into it. Turn me sick with horror to see it struggling and the sound of its screams... What's that? Oh, that.
I wish it were now. So do I. Oh, now don't be silly Good night, Beryl. Good night, dear.
What's the matter? Why are the bells ringing at this hour? And so strangely? What's the matter with the Hunchback? You see?
There's a lot you have to know. I might as well start now. I didn't know there were women like that. I only told you all this so you'd understand what happened today. I'm glad it happened. Changes a lot of ideas I've had about you. I'm glad, too.
The way it is in books. Or prizefights. I suppose I'm interrupting what is undoubtedly a most touching farewell. But Maida, darling, I do hope your going abroad at this time won't be a mistake. A mistake? To go away and leave such a fascinating husband around loose. I don't like to tell you this, dear, but... Then I'm sure I won't want to hear it, darling.
They're tightening up on the requirements. All she can do is wait. That's all any of us can do. Wait, wait. We've been waiting, it's been four months and we're just where we were when we started. Look, dear, do you think I like it? Don't you think it means as much to me as it does to you?
All she can do is wait. That's all any of us can do. Wait, wait. We've been waiting, it's been four months and we're just where we were when we started. Look, dear, do you think I like it? Don't you think it means as much to me as it does to you? I don't know whether it does or not.
Can you make out the beacon light? - Not yet. About time we came up with it. - Look to starboard.
It's me! I'm doin' it, see. And I'll ride up the capitol steps if I feel like it. So you talked it over, huh? Without me. Well, I don't like it, and it ain't the way I aim to have things.
What's that? Is there an armoire in that room? What? I said is there an armoire in that room? Of course there is.
Is there a job I haven't done? All different, all the same. Spray painting, lead painting. Lead painting's no good, just like the sand gun. When I couldn't fight it anymore, I just gave in.
You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you. Thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. - Beautiful, isn't it?
Thank you. Thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. - Beautiful, isn't it? - Yes, it is.
As basic material, you may not be bad. But you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. I feel very sorry for you. But you must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles. Look at it.
Please. What do you see? I see a house. Looks like any other house. - What's remarkable about it?
Looks like any other house. - What's remarkable about it? - It's not the structure. It's the spirit that dwells within it. It has three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
Two men are looking at the moon. One of them says to the other: "Is it true that a lot of people live on the moon?" The other one says, "Sure it's true, about 500 million." Then the first one says:
It has a little knob that you turn. - A little knob, that's right. - Yeah. Maybe it's in here. - Just a little knob.
- And you, too, Ninotchka. - About what? - Ever since you've been back from Paris-- I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
- Naturally, it's not the Royal Suite. Comrades, once and for all, we are in Moscow. Yes, there's no doubt of that. Just look out of the window and there it is. And it's great.
It's wonderful. Just see how happy the people look from here. Can you blame them? At least the May Day parade is over. That's another thing.
I shall do my best. How do you like it, Ninotchka? Isn't it wonderful? - Tell us, Ninotchka. - Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski--
How do you like it, Ninotchka? Isn't it wonderful? - Tell us, Ninotchka. - Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski-- Now, please don't start figuring it out in cows.
It may come around the corner... - when you walk down the street. - It may step out of a bazaar. It may be waiting for you in a corridor. It may hide in the shadow of a minaret.
- Clem came to wish me happiness. - Yes, of course. - By the way, I almost forgot. I brought this for you. Funny.
It was expected she might die as her father did, wasn't it? Yes, I thought everyone knew that. You did, didn't you? It's in her family, isn't it? I thought everybody knew that too.
I'll adopt Tina legally. Adopt? You adopt Tina? If she has my name, the Ralston name and part of the Ralston fortune... - Why haven't you mentioned this plan?
- Let 'em fly. - OK, Tex. Joe! That's the most wonderful thing I've ever seen. Yes, reminded you of a great, beautiful bird, didn't it? It didn't at all.
Joe! That's the most wonderful thing I've ever seen. Yes, reminded you of a great, beautiful bird, didn't it? It didn't at all. That's why it's so wonderful.
- Now, how do you know? The girl I was telling you about came as close to it as anybody I ever met. But one night when I was lost in a fog and was glad to get back down, what do you think the welcome-home speech was? She'd hoped I'd crashed. - What? - She couldn't stand the gaff.
The girl I was telling you about came as close to it as anybody I ever met. But one night when I was lost in a fog and was glad to get back down, what do you think the welcome-home speech was? She'd hoped I'd crashed. - What? - She couldn't stand the gaff. Said she'd rather see me dead, have it over with.
- What pictures? Those pictures of you as a baby. - We're right back where we started. - That was a million years ago. - What's the matter with your foot? - I slipped on the porch. - Don't walk around on it.
And had I that duty, Her Majesty's conduct has canceled it. As for asking her pardon, why should I ask pardon for receiving an insult? " Stop it! No. No, go on.
-You want him home again, I suppose? -Oh, more than anything in the world. He shall be recalled. I don't know how to thank Your Majesty. But it's doubtful if he'll come.
And for what? A few miserable acres of fever-smitten bog and handfuls of tattered peasants whose only desire is to be left in peace to cut each other's throats. Well, they may. I'll put an end to it. Not another man goes to Ireland.
My dear Sir Walter. Well, well, well. You're even more splendid than I'd imagined. Even in my retreat, news came of that silver armor of yours. -I was ill.
Will you promise? Promise. I promise. Now we must go and talk of Ireland. This deficit has grown to alarming proportions.
It's a difficult, dangerous job so how can we blame Lord Essex for refusing to risk it? You challenge me to go? Give me the men I need. Put me in command. If I fail to crush Tyrone, take my sword.
Yes, Your Majesty. It was I who intercepted your letters. They couldn't have done it without my help. Essex, thinking himself forgotten turned against you, but it wasn't his fault. He didn't know.
You sent for me. Yes. You spoil me for death. Wouldn't it have been kinder to have left me with my thoughts? Are you so set on dying?
With a wonderful landing Jurieux has arrived safely. The crowd has invaded the airfield and wants to break through. I'll try too. The Minister couldn't be here but he wishes to express his admiration and sincere congratulations. It's mainly a matter of equipment.
It's a romantic black woman. The mechanism works. Have you heard what André Jurieux said? I can well imagine how it went. He was going to risk his life. How could you have refused him this small mark of loving friendship that he must have been begging for?
-Why? I love squirrels. -They're nice but very damaging. Here, look. How beautiful!
-From a gun? -A gun. A gun bullet. Does it surprise you? -Christine has disappeared! -She disappeared.
Try this. Now, stoop down. Don't let it fall. That's the way they teach you in dancing school. I don't know.
Maybe I'd better show you how it goes first, and then we can dance together. - Maybe that would be better. - Now watch me. Now with me. You must be very fond of that piece. They've played it every time we've danced.
No more dance. Squaw laugh. I'm awfully sorry. Honest. I won't do it anymore. Please don't stop dancing.
- You shouldn't have come. - I had to. Mr. Standing sent to another post for help... but they can't get here in time, so after dark tonight... he's coming with a few men to try to rescue you. But he's afraid that if the Indians see him coming, they'll- - I have to see Mr. Big Eagle somehow, before it gets dark. - It won't do any good, Sue. It will.
What's that? That's just an okapi, Mrs. Lancing. Okapi? Never heard of it. A very rare animal.
That's just an okapi, Mrs. Lancing. Okapi? Never heard of it. A very rare animal. The old-time hunters used to think it was a cross between a giraffe and a zebra.
Our entire family will be very grateful to you. I can show you the grave now, if you'd like. Thank you. Whenever it's convenient. We shall be about here for a day or two.
I really don't see how it concerns me. There's an established custom in dealing with those matters. Established custom? If it's ivory the party's after... the hunter in charge usually gets 10% of whatever they bring out. Very well.
Picture me A balcony Above, a voice sings low Wherefore art thou, Romeo? I hear a beat How sweet! Just to register emotion Jealousy, devotion And really feel the part
This is a spell, this is! It's the Wicked Witch! What'll we do? Help! Help!
But they have one thing you haven't got. A testimonial. Therefore, in consideration of your kindness I take pleasure at this time in presenting you with a small token of our esteem and affection. And remember, my sentimental friend that a heart is not judged by how much you love but by how much you are loved by others. It ticks! Listen!
And it's that if I ever go looking for my heart's desire again I won't look any further than my own back yard because if it isn't there I never really lost it to begin with. is that right? That's all it is. But that's so easy! I should've thought of it for you.
There, there, lie quiet now. You just had a bad dream. Remember me your old pal, Hunk? And me Hickory? You couldn't forget my face, could you?
But, Sylvia, darling, who told you? A manicurist? Go on. This manicurist, she's perfectly divine, she said to me: "I know something about rich Mrs. Haines." But, Sylvia, suppose Mary should hear about it? Wouldn't it be terrible?
Howard wants me to go on a world cruise. - Oh, isn't that adorable? - It's divine. - Don't tell me, but how much is it? - Two hundred and twenty-five.
- Don't tell me, but how much is it? - Two hundred and twenty-five. - It is a nightgown, isn't it? - Yes. I'd be glad to wear it for an evening gown. Isn't she naive?
- Please don't bother. Mary, how humiliating. Mary, you poor darling, I could die for you. What's the matter? I don't want it.
- She's a notary. - How do you do? I brought the inventories of the furniture. Mr. Haines wants to know if he can have the portrait of Little Mary. - Oh, yes, but it's in storage.
Certainly, dear. As my last official act in Reno, I'm going to prepare the supper with my own little hands. - Lucy, any mail? - Here it is, my lady.
Then another time it turns into a kitchenette. Another time into a fireplace. You can't light it but it looks awful cute. - What turns into a fireplace? - This gig in the corner.
I wish they'd get it over with. You start thinking about that $25,000, or even the $5,000... - Or anything. - You said it. When you've got it right in your mitts, they leave you with your tongue hanging out.
Well, let that be a lesson to you. What is so funny about that? What is the meaning of this demonstration, Mr Waterbury? I demand an explanation, and it had better be good. It is very good, sir.
- What's that? - Is this the Davenport your ma wanted? The crank fits on here and when you turn it it... Makes into a full-size double bed at night. Guy said it works swell. What did you go get that for?
- Is this the Davenport your ma wanted? The crank fits on here and when you turn it it... Makes into a full-size double bed at night. Guy said it works swell. What did you go get that for? Well, we kinda hoped that it might make up for the... phoney telegram.
And then... Well, we don't exactly know what happened. Some scientists think that great droughts and earthquakes turned the whole world into a gigantic dustbowl. In any case, the dinosaurs were wiped out. That is where our story ends.
A tenderfoot is an easterner. Out West, they shoot at anything that looks Eastern. They'll blow his head off if he goes out West with that flea incubator. What's the matter with that hat? It cost a lot of money.
Say, did you see something flying across here? Might have been a pigeon. - No, it wasn't a pigeon. It was green. Must have been a frog.
We always pay. Here, I owe you 10 cents. Joseph Panello. That's rich and rare. A business transaction, Joe.
Sure. You just go half a mile up the road. You can't miss it. Say, you can do me a favor. I got a telegram for Dan Wilson.
You can't miss it. Say, you can do me a favor. I got a telegram for Dan Wilson. You can deliver it and save me the trip. Sure, we'll deliver the telegram.
Dan Wilson. That means we don't open it. You promise? Right. All right.
Blowin' us away now. Are you crazy? Some say I am. You wanna hear how it happened? That's what I' asking you, ain't it?
First and only, I think about my folks. What happens to others is their own lookout. Yeah, but you don't understand, son. This is my land! Used to be.
Picking oranges and peaches? - Well, we aim to take whatever they got. - What's so funny about that? What's so funny about it? I've just been out there.
This ain't a grocery store. We got bread to make sandwiches. I know, ma'am. Only, it's for an old lady. No teeth.
- No, ma'am. - Well, you stay by that door. How's it feel? Busted my cheek, but I can still see. - What did you hear?
They know he got hit in the face. I' sorry, Ma. I didn't know what I was doing any more than when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was going to do it. Oh, it's all right, Tommy.
You know, funny thing happened to me the other day. I'm playing the 12-ball for the side pocket and the blue ball's right in the way. I look over behind the eight rock, and do you know what happened to the eight rock? Come in. Come in.
I'd be glad to, Mr. McGinty, anytime except tonight. You know, if you told anybody we'd been living like this just down the hall for six months, neither one of us ever given the other one a thought, they wouldn't believe it. That's right. Even if it was true, they wouldn't believe it.

they wouldn't believe it. That's right. Even if it was true, they wouldn't believe it. Here it is, Miss Catherine. It took them a little longer than...
Or do you like pink? What do we need a State Capital building for? What do we need it for? This one is falling apart. Look.
I don't know yet. heaven is far away, and empty is the night. in a dark chamber my heart is awake it sleeps and waits, wondering where the dream may carry it do you hear, my heart? do you hear, my heart? it finds the way by the power of the stars it finds you and happily laughs my heart

I only hear the queen's voice, like a dark melody a new poem, Riccio? I don't like it, it doesn't rhyme I have sung, I wrote poems, and nothing has remained but you are here, Maria you are the life life? doesn't it pass us all by? and we watch it go by? one can catch it no, no!

I've been a reporter for 20 years. I never heard that. Neither did I. I know it sounds silly, dear, but do it for me. Yes, yes, right now. All right. Just a minute.
- I give the marriage six months. She won't be able to be away from the paper any longer. Did you see her when that bell went off? It must be pretty nice to be able to walk out of a place and quit. I had a publicity job offered to me last year.
I'll give it to you. But first I have to tell you I gave him money. And it wasn't exactly mine. It's Bruce's money and I want it back. Bruce's money?
I'll give you the tickets. You'll find your money in the wallet. My wallet? This is my wallet. Say, there's something funny going on... What are you doing?
How can I ever face Bruce again? - Look at me, Hildy. - I am looking at you, you murderer. If it was my own grandmother, I'd carry on. - You know I would, for the paper.
Get the mayor over here. Look, madam, be honest. If you were out joyriding plastered, or got into a scrape, why don't you admit it instead of accusing innocent people? You ruffian! How dare you talk like that to me! He's just crazy, Mother.
What do you mean by that, Leslie? You could get the letter. Do you think it's so easy to do away with unwelcome evidence? Surely nothing would have been said to you... ... iftheownerweren'tquiteprepared to sell it. That's true.
This was a pretty serious mistake... ... andsherealizedit. Who has the letter? Hammond's widow. And she threatens to turn it over to the prosecution. Well, what if she does?
A few years ago. How did you happen to take it up? I had nothing else to do. It appealed to me. It must take enormous concentration...
How did you happen to take it up? I had nothing else to do. It appealed to me. It must take enormous concentration... ... andpatience. I find it soothing.
What are you going to do? -What can I do? -Don't tell him. I can't bear any more. You heard him. He wants the money to buy the estate. -He can't. He hasn't got it. -Give me time. Where's the letter? I have it in my pocket.
What shall I do? I wish to heaven I knew. If only there were some other way. Tell him and have done with it. Now, this is really a handsome estate.
What do these other expenses amount to? Well, the principal item is that letter of Leslie's I mentioned to you. Yes. I'd almost forgotten about that. -You were going to... ? -l had to pay a great deal of money for it. Well, if you thought it necessary, I'm not going to grouse.
We can put some of your things in it in case your bag is crowded. In fact, I'll pack for you, if you want. I know how you hate it. Darling, you've done something to this sleeve. A cigarette burn. That's what it is. And your new coat too. Never mind.
I know very little about it, my dear capitán. Swordplay is such a violent business. (CHUCKLING) So, this bird killed the black-breasted red? - Yes, Your Excellency.
Inez has... Inez has gone crazy over the idea of Madrid. She's been at me night and day to take her there. This should do it. This should suit that maniac.
They're friends of Junius. And they expect to stay here? I think that's queer, indeed. - It's queerer than that. It's paranoiac.
You wanted to. Mr. Connor, what would you...? A nice story for Spy, incidentally. Too bad we can't supply photos of you. The fuss you made over that childish episode!
- None. You have a good mind, a pretty face, a disciplined body doing what you tell it everything it takes to make a lovely woman, except the one essential. An understanding heart. Without that, you might as well be made of bronze. That's an awful thing to say to anyone.
I'll tell you. Sure. And remember, Mike with the rich and mighty... Do you know what time it is? It's after 4.
With his both arms full of something, and guess what it turned out to be. - What? - You. And some clothes. Wasn't it funny?
How are you? - Just about as you'd think. - You seen Kidd? - I left a copy of it at my house for him. - And?
But never in my life not if I live to be 100, will I forget how you tried to stand me on my feet again today. - Oh, you? You're in great shape. Tell me, what did you think of my wedding present? I like my presents at least acknowledged.
- Your attitude is difficult to understand. - Yes, I can see that it would be. - Not necessarily. - You keep out of this. You forget I am out of it.
- Oh, it's all right. We all go haywire at times. And if we don't, maybe we ought to. Liz... You see, it really wasn't Tracy at all, Mr. Kittredge.
The interests of Spain do not command my respect... -as they evidently do his lordship's. -I protest! Capt. Thorpe, you will at least show the proper respect for my ministers. So you have taken it upon yourself to remedy the defects of Spanish justice? Insofar as it lies within my power, yes, Your Grace.
But you are too much. Bring the drinks. No, thanks. I'm on the grape-juice wagon. Antro.
It was entirely my fault. I know. Sure, Bijou is only a little bitty baby. A baby? Does he laugh by the hour, or is it piecework? You had a good laugh the other night too, didn't you?
Where did you? Can't you do something about it? - What's that? - Oh, that? Uh, nothing. Uh...
You fool! You don't know what you're talking about! When he thinks of all the years he's been in the Navy and all he's worked for has gone by the board, he's gonna hate your insides. You can't get the Navy out of your heart and your blood, honest you can't. If he didn't kill you, you'd do it yourself.
Yes, Mr. Matuschek. I can buy two dozen of these cigarette boxes at Miklos Brothers. What do you think of it? I think it's great. Well, open it. No, Mr. Matuschek, it's not for us. But you haven't listened to it.
But, Emma, I don't understand it. Only last Monday I gave you... No, I'm not complaining. It's quite a bit of money. Yeah, all right.
- Pardon me, sir. - What is it now? Sir, for several days your attitude toward me seems to have changed. - Has it? - Yes, Mr. Matuschek, it has.
- That's what I was thinking of. You can't miss. If I would get such a wallet, I would be one of the happiest men in the world. On one side... Here, I'll show you. On one side, I put a picture of my wife and on the other side, my little baby.
I still get my check every Saturday. But you get ordered around every other day. Ain't for me. Hey, Red, this steak's tough. You can't send it back now.
- If you don't...! - All right! Don't get hot. - I'll give you a check. - What'll we do, use it for a tire patch?
- What is it, and how much does it cost? - Joe says he can't make our party. Sure you can. It's our new house. I want you to see it.
- Just wait till I see her. Just wait. - What's the matter with you? - That door it opened. - Of course it did. We broke the ray.
Yes. The doors made me do it. The doors made me do it. The doors made me do it! - Matron, remove the witness.
Alas, I cannot tell day from night. It was my dog. - How can a dog tell bad from good? - See for yourself. Now, by the wonder of Allah -
Oh, I can't bear to be kept waiting. Ooh. This is exciting, this. If Your Highness would wind it yourself. What's it going to do? Hmm? Move its legs, or arch its neck? Or - Or wag its tail?
- Pull the reins! I am no longer a man. I am a bird! I'm the king of birds! No! Oh.
I am a bird! I'm the king of birds! No! Oh. Mmm, I want it! I want it. I must have it, and I'll give you anything you wish for it.
When you rode hopeless and lost in the desert, who guided you? When you were sold in the slave market, who bought you Always Jaffar. It was in my house you were cared for, to sleep your sleep... and dream to its end... your first dream of love. It was I who woke you. No.
This morning's front page? That's right, Solly, that means we'll have to remake again. - Go down and tell them. - All right. When you're through with that, I'd like to have it back. I'd like to keep that particular piece of paper myself.
I absolutely adore you. Charles, even newspapermen have to sleep. I'll call Mr. Bernstein and have him put off my appointments till noon. What time is it? I don't know. It's late.
Come on, alley-oop. I gotta wash behind your ears. You ought to be proud. You're a success. Look! A peanut. Come on, eat it.
You ought to be proud. You're a success. Look! A peanut. Come on, eat it. It's got lots of vitamins.
This is a very unusual type of duel. It comes from Trinidad. The southern part of Trinidad. Pardon me. Thank you.
- Clementine. - All right. Give it to me. - I'll give it to Madame. - No.
Give it to me. - I'll give it to Madame. - No. I have to give it to her personally. This way.
- I'll give it to Madame. - No. I have to give it to her personally. This way. Are you noticing how it drapes?
- We can't wait to hear you. - Oh, no, please. - We won't take no for an answer. - Charles. - I order you to sing, my dear.
I'll take it. He's not to be disturbed. - It's very important he gets it. - Why? Have you read it?
- Does it have bacon and eggs in it? - No, but it has essence of guinea fowl. And spirits of spinach. Go on, it's good for you. No, boys, I'm going to eat food.
It's only a dud dead. - A dead dud. - See? It's all tarnished. Won't that make a pretty souvenir after it's polished?
Won't that make a pretty souvenir after it's polished? Look, it's full of powder. Hey! That's Private Meeley's tobacco! So it is.
Look, it's full of powder. Hey! That's Private Meeley's tobacco! So it is. I'll take it outside and sift it.
- He's too happy. You know how he was before he went into Watson's malady? I'll never forget it. That was terrible. - Say, Ollie. - What?
I thought it was a 5. Even so, you counted 10. You'll never get rich... I know the song. Anyway, what's money? - Mere scraps of paper.
Yes, I'm sorry. I made it just a moment before you came in. How do you like that? He ain't even a first-class private. I think he is.
We've been worrying about you. Do you know it's after 8:00? I've been taking a lesson in photography. Well, you seem unusually happy about it. I am.
And they're showing a Mickey Duck. Thanks a lot, boys. But I have a date with Ginger. Daniel, you shouldn't go out with girls. It's dangerous.
Thanks a lot, boys. But I have a date with Ginger. Daniel, you shouldn't go out with girls. It's dangerous. It might affect your heart.
But I have a date with Ginger. Daniel, you shouldn't go out with girls. It's dangerous. It might affect your heart. It has already.
Get going. - You know what, Ollie? - What? I feel like a mouse. We had to do it.
This is Blue Army, and you're our prisoners. Pleased to meet... All right, come on. Pile out of there. - What will we do?
-Thing at 31 6? -I... . 316. They've got no money or insurance. It's murder. Tough luck, Pfiffer.
Out of the house and across the street, as I had run a hundred times before. Softly now, for respect for chapel was the first thing my father taught us. Then straight to Mrs Tossal the Shop, for that toffee which you could chew for hours, it seems to me now. And even after it had gone down, you could swallow and still find the taste of it hiding behind your tongue. It is with me now, so many years later.
I have been busy with the union. Unions are the work of the Devil. You will come to no good end. At least I am not sitting on it, talking rubbish in chapel. - Look here...
And I'm saying it plain to be heard. 'Tis good. With honours, then. Our son is a scholar. What is it, Huw? I can't make sense with it.
I wish you wouldn't do that. I'm sure if you tried once more... No, thanks. I'd rather pay 32,000 than lose a really large amount. This is very embarrassing. Just make it out to cash.
- Very good, milady. Thank you. I'll probably talk like a cockeyed duchess the rest of my life. It won't even take six weeks. One day about two weeks from now, we'll be riding in the hills, past waterfalls and mountain greenery, up and down ravines and around through vine-covered trails... till we come to a spot where the scenery will be so gorgeous,
Hello? Yes, Horace. I'm sorry, Eve. He won't do it. I thought it was a pretty fair offer.
Yes, Horace. I'm sorry, Eve. He won't do it. I thought it was a pretty fair offer. As a matter of fact, I think you're a sucker to make it.
Hello, Sid? I think I'm going to have to tell a coroner to go to blazes, Sid. Can I hide behind the sanctity of my client's identity secrets and whatnots all the same, priest or lawyer? But Dundy's getting a little rambunctious, and maybe it is a bit thick this time. What'll it cost to be on the safe side?
That's probably true. He only had a couple hundred when I searched him this afternoon at my office. I shall be able to have the money for you at, say, 10:30 in the morning. But I haven't got the falcon. I'll have it in another week at the most, though.
No! That's the one I got from Kemidov. I swear it! You. It's you who bungled it. You and your stupid attempt to buy it! Kemidov found out how valuable it was!
How can you do this to me, Sam? Surely, Mr. Archer wasn't as much to you as... [Brigid sobs] Listen. This won't do any good.
It costs you two guineas on Regent Street. You should have that and put it in the gentleman's heart, no? Is it real silver? Better. It's chromium.
I present you with this dangerous weapon, mademoiselle... with my undying gratitude and admiration. May you never lodge it in the wrong heart. - There you are, sir. - One pound, 20 shillings. I give you change.
- This the, uh, ooftish? - That is the money, yes. If you don't mind, we'll check the amount. No, no. I'll just take £500.
No, no. I'll just take £500. And, uh, Saul, you can instruct her how to deposit it. - Very good. - I don't want it.
He'll address it to, uh- to... your name. Mr. Stokes. Mr. Stokes, care of the post office at Lyme Regis. - Lyme Regis. - Uh, have you got a pencil?
- Now you cannot get out. - You can't get in, you mean. I have no desire to enter a cave after a trapped animal... even though I know you have no weapons. I admired your stone door so much that I imitated it... by wedging another stone on the outside. You're sealed up, as in a grave.
You've been Immensely helpful. - What is it you want? - Now you're being sensible. - Have you got It? - What Is It?
Take your time. - Have you got a cigarette? - Yes. Certainly. It's on the stick. Pull It In.
Hand out the document. You'll have to reach for it. Hand it out through the venthole. Your time Is up. I'm waiting.
You'll have to reach for it. Hand it out through the venthole. Your time Is up. I'm waiting. And be sure It's signed.
Hand it out through the venthole. Your time Is up. I'm waiting. And be sure It's signed. There It Is.
I'll come back with it signed, Mr. Custer. Take me to the room. Mr. Smith, it's me, Sammy, from the office. Mr. Custer says you'll have to sign this. We can't keep postponing the case.
Take me to the room. Mr. Smith, it's me, Sammy, from the office. Mr. Custer says you'll have to sign this. We can't keep postponing the case. Push it under the door.
Just a minute. Good night, David. Your nose is bleeding. Are you sure that stuff is good for a nosebleed? Best thing in the world.
I only got a couple of minutes. Mr. Charles isn't here. Can you give it to me? No, I gotta give it to him. I'm going away, see?
Really? Well, how nice. - A camellia doesn't have any fragrance. - It doesn't need any around you. I'm glad you like my perfume. It's new.
- Nicky! I found this hidden in Barrow's apartment. While I was there, Miss Porter came in. She'd been there before. That's a lie!
He live in apartment 32A. That's right, at the top of the stairs. Well, gentlemen and ladies we have our murderer. Nicky, I can't stand it! Was it me?
That's right, at the top of the stairs. Well, gentlemen and ladies we have our murderer. Nicky, I can't stand it! Was it me? Yeah, Nick, is it her?
Not and live under this roof with me, you ain't. He's been worrying himself half-crazy over you, Ben. Well, he won't have to no more. Please don't go thisaway. He'll get over it.
Here. - I ain't no place to hide it. - Tom says I was to give it to you. I'd be scared to hold all that. I ain't never had no money.
Never. You gotta trust me. Ain't I always told you the truth? Ain't I kept money for you? I ain't gonna touch it. Keep the money or throw it away.
- What's wrong 'tween you and him? - I can't tell you. How come? I couldn't stand it if you got down on me too. Is it something you done?
At least they hadn't when I left. What else do they have in the civilization, Mother? Lots of things. There's the radio, for instance. It's like a box, and you can hear music and voices coming right out of it. You mean the box can talk? Not really.
I see. Is there any more of it? There's lots of it on the bottom. Lots of it. What do you do with it?
We have some medicine that might help. Sulfamyradol. It's a new drug that works wonders in cases such as this. - Elliott's already sent a runner for some. - Where?
What's the matter? - Supper ready? - Supper? What about that wood? Well, there it is, can't you see it?
- Supper ready? - Supper? What about that wood? Well, there it is, can't you see it? How come I can still see it?
How come you didn't sell it? Well, you can't sell no wood if nobody wants to buy no wood, can you? You're the craziest old fool I guess I ever did see. That's the fourth time you've taken that same load to town and brung it back. Ain't even had it out of the car.
Oh, about 17, 18 head. And there ain't one of them worth the powder to blow them up. How much rent would it be, Payne? Hundred dollars for the year. Hundred dollars?
Just shove it out of your way. Yeah. I told you you could do it, Dude boy. Oh, ain't this a pretty automobile? Oh, I knew you could do it, Dude boy.
"Wouldn't it be smart if I was to haul that wood to Augusta and sell it?" Why, that's Henry Peabody's wood, ain't it? - But he ain't here. - I know, but it don't seem just right. Wait a minute.
- But he ain't here. - I know, but it don't seem just right. Wait a minute. I ain't stealing it. I'm just figuring on selling it and giving Henry half of that money.
What are you doing? Why, this durn old top didn't wanna go down! - Did you hurt the car much? - Oh, not the running of it. - And the horn wasn't hurt none.
- Come here. Say, you wanna buy a brand-new automobile cheap? - This one? - Yeah, it's brand-new. It ain't been hardly broke in yet.
This ain't no poor farm. You won't ever see no poorer farm. Why, you made a mistake. This is my place, boy. Maybe I did, but I had to do it.
- I took an interest in your work. - Really? So much so that this morning I was walking down Fifth Avenue I saw something rather beautiful that reminded me of you. I wanted you to have it very much, and so I bought it for you. This couldn't be a diamond bracelet, could it?
- Open it. "To my dear, sweet Sheila." The funny thing was that when my wife found that in my pocket she thought that I was the one who bought it for you. How could you possibly think such a thing? Because I know Martin.
The funny thing was that when my wife found that in my pocket she thought that I was the one who bought it for you. How could you possibly think such a thing? Because I know Martin. Do you like it, Sheila? Like it?
What's wonderful about you isn't anything I taught you. What's wonderful about you is you. That's bracelet talk. Sure it is, but not the way you think it is. That bracelet happens to mean an awful lot to me.
What's wonderful about you is you. That's bracelet talk. Sure it is, but not the way you think it is. That bracelet happens to mean an awful lot to me. It brought us together.
That's bracelet talk. Sure it is, but not the way you think it is. That bracelet happens to mean an awful lot to me. It brought us together. Well, that's one way of looking at it.
Oh, Mr. Curtis. You frightened me! What do you think you did to me? What are you doing here? This happens to be my apartment. I'm sorry. I didn't know.
It's wonderful. I think it's a fine play. Honestly, Maggie? You telling me the truth? It's better than that. I think it's great. May I take it with me?
I think it's a fine play. Honestly, Maggie? You telling me the truth? It's better than that. I think it's great. May I take it with me? I wanna read it again myself. Sure.
I had the most wonderful evening. I've been ice-skating for the first time. I'm the first person to do a figure eight from a sitting position. We are not amused. Bert read me his play. It's superb. It's not just a play by a newspaperman.

Lorraine, my blossom, I have the most wonderful news for you. I've been reading the most brilliant play with an enchanting part in it for you. - Why, you're on-stage every minute. - Darling. What? Darling, why do I have to come there?
Dear Mr. Whiteside, I've been trying all day to see you to give you this. Why, Miss Stanley, a Christmas gift for me? Oh, it's just a trifle. But I wanted you to have it. It's a picture of me as I used to be.
Why, Miss Stanley, a Christmas gift for me? Oh, it's just a trifle. But I wanted you to have it. It's a picture of me as I used to be. It was taken on another Christmas Eve many years ago.
Is it possible that men of your apparent intelligence have not heard of the "Inflato"? You see, we've been out of town, haven't we, Ollie? - Inflato? - Yes, the name of this little device. Inflato, taken from the word "inflation."
Now, if you gentlemen is serious, I got to go and report this. Give it another whirl, Ollie. Let me try it. Wait a minute, maybe I... Let me try, see if I can't get this thing...
Stanley. Oh, Stanley. Well, what happened, sir? - Somebody slugged me. - Oh, well that's too bad.
I was misinformed. Excuse me, Rick. A gentleman inside has won 20,000 francs and the cashier would Iike some money. - I'lI get it from the safe. I'm so upset. You know-
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa. Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By." I can't remember it. I'm a little rusty on it. I'll hum it for you.
No, sir. I'm staying right here. They grab Ugarte, then she walks in. That's the way it goes. One in, one out. - Sam. - Yes, boss.
- Stop it. You know what I wanna hear. - I don't. You played it for her, you can play it for me. - I don't remember-
You know what I wanna hear. - I don't. You played it for her, you can play it for me. - I don't remember- - If she can stand it, I can.
The "wow" finish. A guy standing on a platform in the rain with a comical look on his face from his insides having been kicked out. Can I tell you a story, Rick? Has it got a "wow" finish? I don't know the finish yet.
Dough. Sure, that we are, but it's good to know every check you cash in... ..means a jap's cashed in too. Wait a minute, fellas. We're all making the same salary: 600 bucks a month and 500 a jap, right? Back home most of us would kill rattlesnakes whether there was a bounty on them or not. But you're protecting your home. This is not our home. It's not our fight.
"Darling, I swear." You lie. If you don't... You're on. Take a bow. So this is Holiday Inn. Yeah, will be if it ever opens up.
Come on, let's get out of this before you catch cold. All right. Oh! Well, here's what cooks. Oh! Why, this is darling.
It's kind of a roundabout way to go at it, but let's try it. i Are you decent? Yes, come in. What's that? Well, I thought it over, and I believe our number would go better in blackface.
Well, I thought it over, and I believe our number would go better in blackface. Oh, I thought we were gonna do it like this. Well, that was before I... before I thought it over. I'll look terrible in the stuff. No.

Estelle! Estelle! Now, you get back in that body. No. I didn't like it.
- He's feeling better lately, aren't you? - I missed you at the office. Tax payments have been coming up against the old Timberlake-Fitzroy Corporation. There's no sense in throwing money away on a dead company. This statement says the corporation's dissolved.
I'll protect myself, never fear. What are you going to do? Are you going to let them...? I'll never stand in their way. Craig's a lawyer.
- Me. Love me? Peter, I've got a surprise for you. Where'd you get it? Ask no questions.
Perhaps she'd like to use it. - No, thanks. - I quite understand, my dear. Besides, it is Stanley's car. It's just standing idle in the garage.
He's dead. Stanley, don't torture yourself. Life and death happen. If it hadn't been for me, he'd still be alive. He'd still be alive.
I'm going out. - Oh, well, good night. - Good night. What is the matter, Stanley? Stanley, what is it?
- May I sit down? - Yes, please. Craig, I've got a favor to ask of you. Would you explain this to me? It's Peter's.
I mean, in a way it was. Because, you see, I'd come in from a drive and instead of taking the car to the garage as I usually do I left it out front. - You see, he was going to wash it, but... - Oh, Stanley, it wasn't. It couldn't have been.
Why, I suppose pretty much everybody I know. It's pretty general. - Who said so? - Wha? - Well I hardly think it would be fair to give names. - Look here. One of your best friends is that mother of Charlie Johnson's across the way. - Has she ever mentioned this to you? - Well she may have intimated it...
I'm saying too much for wisdom, I fear. But oh my dear, won't you be strong? Such a little short strength it would need. don't strike my life down twice, dear. This time I've not deserved it.
Oh, for gosh sakes will you get up! Don't sit there with your back against the boiler. - Get up, aunt Fanny! - It's not hot, it's cold. The plumbers disconnected it. I-I wouldn't mind if they hadn't!
A thing which, years ago, had been the eagerest hope of many, many good citizens of the town. Now it came at last. George Amberson Minafer had got his come-uppance. He got it three times filled, and running over. But those who has so longed for it were not there to see it.
The other evening he was sure about it. Yes. He's always sure in bars. It's later, making it happen, that it's difficult. What's that? Leave it. I took it from a friend with dark thoughts.
Women love security. You're doing it again. Gloria... I won't say it again, Gloria. Sorry.
You won't be needing me again, Mr Decrey? - No, thank you. - At your service. I had the photos. One of them in particular hurt me.
It scares me. The bracelet you gave me for our 5th anniversary, I lost it. I was still kidding myself. For a moment, I thought she'd tell me everything. She'd actually pawned her bracelet for money.
- No one came. They're getting fed up. And they're trying it on. It's only human. They're going back tomorrow.
If it helps, I think he, too, wonders who he is. Yves is a bird in a tree. A bird is nice, it sings, whistles, preens itself, but you're not sure where it will land. Oh, shit. I can't do these baby clothes.
Who did you tell about the trap apart from Yves? - Be logical, my girl. - No. That's impossible. It's impossible. It's despicable.
Be careful, my dear. Don't catch cold. Did you find them? It was you. Gloria, please. Gloria, open up.
When I was 17, I came in once after midnight. That tread hasn't been fixed since. She locks her door. Make a note of it. Significant, isn't it?
You can show the rest later. - Meet me outside? - I've been thrown out of better places. This morning I referred to a quotation, remember? Yes, Walt Whitman's.
Good. Will you excuse me to send a cable to my wife? I should have this morning. Isobel gets nervous. Of course.
Serves me right for getting a car because I liked the driver's face. - It doesn't matter. - We promised to meet Deb for dinner. How much farther is it? Don't look, just listen.
Including deciding what I wear where I sleep, what I read. Where did you get that dress? Lisa and I bought it in New York. Outrageous. Where's the black and white foulard?
Hot diggity! Hello. Give me Longacre 56599, please. You see, it's strong and safe. It's simple and practical. It lets the light and air through and it's practically invisible from below.
After that, we'd be on velvet. You see, it's a steel mesh made of stretched cables. Every municipality, every town, every city needs one. My patent is basic. $99,000 is a lot of money.
Is that so? He just... $700 just like that? Just like that. I mean, sex didn't even enter into it. Oh, but of course it did, darling.
Oh, no. At his age, darling, it was really more of a blink. Really? This is very illuminating. Well, you don't have to get rigid about it.
How does he want it? In cash, maybe? In cash. So I won't stop the check, the scoundrel... I don't mean me, I mean that whoever's... Well, I don't think he'll ever get it.
They make a handsome couple, don't they? Pardon? My sister and your brother. It would be nice if something came of it. Oh, yes, wouldn't it?
Pardon? My sister and your brother. It would be nice if something came of it. Oh, yes, wouldn't it? It would be wonderful for him.
They want to bake a... I don't know what to say. I didn't realize it was so humorous. Did you really want to put me through all that? I'm afraid I'm...
I don't know what to say. I didn't realize it was so humorous. Did you really want to put me through all that? I'm afraid I'm... There's no use trying to conceal it now.
Look... Darling, I have the most wonderful news. Snoodles is going to build your airport for you. Why should he build it? I'll build it.
I let you think much worse about him than he is. You know how a woman likes sympathy. But what about the $99,000? He didn't want that, I wanted it for him. But...
How's every little thing? I'm very unhappy, as a matter of fact. You'll get over it. You know about Gerry's decision? Yes.
No. I'll let you in on a little secret, Josie. That night I took you to Pittsburgh's party I wanted us to prove something for keeps. I wanted to prove that you could look Pittsburgh in the eye and laugh at him. That he could take you in his arms, you could still laugh, and mean it. We did prove it, didn't we?
I'm goin' whole hog for the miner. I'm gonna make Pittsburgh... the greatest town to work and live in in America! Nah. The boat sailed, Pittsburgh, and you're not on it. Nobody'll ever like or trust you again. We'll see about that. I'll make 'em like me.
I think perhaps he's right. I think perhaps you should go back to the asylum... until you're all well again, and then... Go back? It is best, Smithy. You need care, and you need doctors that understand your case.
A thousand thanks, darling, and goodbye. Smithy, it's all right. Isn't it wonderful? Sam's all right. Now you have nothing to worry about, nothing.
- I? Probably someone congratulating you upon becoming a father. Aren't you ever going to tell me what's in it? I can't believe it. It's fantastic. Darling, please, I can't stand it another second.
Probably someone congratulating you upon becoming a father. Aren't you ever going to tell me what's in it? I can't believe it. It's fantastic. Darling, please, I can't stand it another second. It's from Liverpool, from the editor of The Mercury.
"'Mr. Charles Rainier."' Hello, nuisance. My word. Do you like it? My dear, you look adorable.
Just to be curious. I haven't said that I don't. Oh, no. Would it be too incredible? - It would be fantastic.
I haven't said that I don't. Oh, no. Would it be too incredible? - It would be fantastic. - Then it is fantastic.
- Not exactly. You know... it seemed quite a reasonable idea when it came to me. But now, I'm rather losing my nerve. Why? Is it so startling? It may sound outrageous to you, but it's not a sudden impulse.
I guess we can find a cranny somewhere for you. Better leave word who to notify in case there's any suddenness. Come on. It's port. That's larboard to me.
He's singing to you, Lumpy. Singing like a seal. Heave him over. - Jack, that paper has your name on it. - What?
Yes. I knew her. Jack. Was it Drusilla? Yes.
There's a squall coming up. It won't give you many minutes. Yes, and Romulus doesn't like fish much, either. Bolt the faceplate home. The wreck moved!
Ken saw him too! He was with us at the fire. He handed me the extinguisher. Ken said, "Don't I get to play too?" He was kidding. I handed it to him. Fry was right there with us, I'm sure!
Hello. I got caught in this storm. I'm pretty wet, I'm afraid. Maybe you'd like to come inside and get dry. Did you leave your car down on the road? Put it in the shed.
Get all the things together. After we leave, I want this place cleaned up. You won't be coming back here. Why not? You think they got the place spotted? I'm making sure. You'll have to find another place and store all this stuff. It's not gonna be easy.
You won't be coming back here. Why not? You think they got the place spotted? I'm making sure. You'll have to find another place and store all this stuff. It's not gonna be easy. If you can't handle it, I'll have to get someone else.
Or maybe you could wire me which plane you're taking. We may want to get ahold of you fast. I can do that when I get back to my uncle. Okay. Just keep in touch. I'm glad we came this way. It adds a few miles, but I've become a little sentimental. I want to take a last look at it.
What are you handing' me? Oh, no. You see, I work in a store downtown. I never get a chance to get out. I just sit around all day, and I never see anything. So I said, the first vacation I get, I'm going to see the Statue of Liberty. This must be a big moment for you, huh? Oh, it is.
Pardon me. Hello. Yes. This is Miss Eberli. Why...why someone must have stolen it.
Yes. At once. Now I can be frank with you, Mr. Holmes. Dr. Tobel has disappeared. They found my car on Richmond Bypass wrecked.
Look after him will you Hoffner? I'll take him to the car. Well, I expected you but not with my revolver. You realize, of course, when I was brought into the room blindfolded - I heard the mechanism of this door. - Of course.
Nobody is gonna call me a Nazi and get away with it. Well, help me then. Tell me what Christopher means. Well, don't anybody know? Its got to mean something.
Withdraw material from elsewhere? If need be, yes. This calls for action and lots of it. There's something curious about this broadcast. He said tomorrow.
I just cashed out. No luck? - Percentage is with the house. Pretty hard to beat. But it has been done, hasn't it? So they tell me.
-Yeah, that's what they call it. We've got a different name for it. - My uncle must have signed it. Which doesn't make it so funny. - Why not?
It's becoming. You've grown into it. And what's that? - It's the coffee boiling. - Take it off.
- Ever had borscht, professor? - What's that? Beet soup with sour cream. It's a Polish dish. With an egg in it.
With an egg in it. Don't let anybody give it to you without an egg in it. - We must have some, Miss Shelley. - Of course. As soon as I finish my course in American cooking...
- Yes, sir. - Borscht, please. - A quart. - Yes. With an egg in it.
Will you stop walking around and lie down for a while? I can't figure it out. Why can't 100 policemen find one man with a bad ankle? What the dickens is that to you? Nothing.
A whole chicken. He has an enormous appetite. Will somebody listen to me? Bracken's alive. Why should Dilg go to jail?
Place kind of gives me the willies too, Buck. Queer, wasn't it? The way it suddenly shot up above the clouds? Another couple of feet, we'd smack right into it. - Still looks like Africa to me.
Maria, be honest, be frank. I've got to know. Did you tell that fellow to walk out of my soliloquy? Sweetheart, darling, I love you. Don't you know that? Don't you feel it? If anything happened to you...
Did you tell that fellow to walk out of my soliloquy? Sweetheart, darling, I love you. Don't you know that? Don't you feel it? If anything happened to you... You think I can do it?
- I felt something coming at us from all sides at once. We heard it. Kate screamed and dropped the lantern. Then I-Then it-it-it closed in on me like- like a blast from a furnace. Only it wasn't hot, it- it was-
We heard it. Kate screamed and dropped the lantern. Then I-Then it-it-it closed in on me like- like a blast from a furnace. Only it wasn't hot, it- it was- It was simply horrible.
Kate screamed and dropped the lantern. Then I-Then it-it-it closed in on me like- like a blast from a furnace. Only it wasn't hot, it- it was- It was simply horrible. Kate screamed again and... then I was fighting it.
Those poachers have a couple of huge, vicious hounds. Look here, darling, why don't you forget about this tonight and try to get some sleep? I'll run along. I'm sure by tomorrow the police will find out what it was. I've done it, Bob.
Seems rather like flying in the face of fate... - in view of what happened to your ancestors. - Superstitious rot. Superstitions are often based on fact. If you want to know more about it, there's a family history in the library. Thanks. I'll have a look at it.
- I've seen that look of yours before, young man. I'm willing to wager that you've about got your man. - I'm not convinced it is a man. - A woman? Animal, vegetable or mineral?
- And here's the one I found. - It's incredible. Well, Inspector, that blows up your spook theory. What's happened? It was sealed in this tube and vacuum.
- One of two things. Either you injected the cobra venom into Kate O'Malley's veins... or you deliberately withheld the information... that venom was in the system at the coroner's inquest. There was no reason for mentioning it. Had no bearing on the case. She didn't die from the venom.
Either you injected the cobra venom into Kate O'Malley's veins... or you deliberately withheld the information... that venom was in the system at the coroner's inquest. There was no reason for mentioning it. Had no bearing on the case. She didn't die from the venom. - But you did inject it into her veins. - No.
- Where is it? - There! - Christy! - Oh, Bob. For a moment I thought you were the monster. Quick.
It was a form of mania that caused its victim to imagine- consciously or subconsciously - that he was a werewolf. That book telling the history of the family had a hint in it. Oh, so you were the one who stole it. Yes. Yes, I'd hoped to keep you from finding out. That their ancestors were balmy?
That book telling the history of the family had a hint in it. Oh, so you were the one who stole it. Yes. Yes, I'd hoped to keep you from finding out. That their ancestors were balmy? Well, let us say, rather, that their ancestors... handed it down from father to son throughout the ages.
See, Tess is my wife. What do you know! That's wonderful! Oh, don't take it wrong, Mrs. Craig. I'm just so excited.
- I haven't seen the doctor. - You've got to see the doctor. You gotta stay off your feet, you know... Tess, I hope it's a boy. - Oh, you sweet...
- You've got to see the doctor. You gotta stay off your feet, you know... Tess, I hope it's a boy. - Oh, you sweet... - It is a boy.
If you wish your new estate to be touched with lasting beauty cherish those gracious visions of your first love. Let them not be blurred by the common events of life. Be not moved in your devotion. Believe in the ideal. You saw it once.
Got paid off a lot of cash. Now, wait a minute. We're not leaving without it. I've had experience. Hand it over. Tell you where his money is if you're so anxious.
We've started the bilge pump. We can keep her under control. All right. Send a man forward to secure the bulkhead. All hands to the cargo winch! Bring your guns to starboard and hold fire.
- No. - And then could we please be sailors? No! - And finally, maybe we could be Marines? But did that discourage them?
You can't proclaim Sisters for petting animals. - They pet the Devil! - That's nonsense. It's true, that beast came to hurt us. It's an innocent animal.
Look in his eyes, see a path of lies and hypocrisy! Sister! A bluebird used to come here, it brought joy and sincerity. And a toad that made us feel compassionate. Mother St John's cat ate them.
I gave up that world. Sending me back is unfair. My dear child... I loved the world I left. You don't know how much I loved it. I ripped it from my heart to come here.
In the head. Wonderful. What's it called? That is called the "Dance of the Pelican" my own original creation. Now, girls, we'll try some bar exercises. Right over here.
He's the croaker, makes examinations and certifies the chump as being a sound insurance risk. Any questions? Mickey, you draw Chambersburg. You can take Jasper along as your croaker. Croaker?
I wouldn't be that stupid. You know, I knew a fella once. He had some money in the bank, and he wouldn't draw it out. And you know what? He lost his job.
- Wait till you see this. - Just sit over there. This is really something. All ready? Now, we'll dirty it up a little.
Tanks, artillery, troops, all must come over this bridge. I must know it is gone. Not before the attack, they'd rebuild it. It must go the minute the attack starts, no sooner, no later. So the bridge is nothing.
Very practical. - He catches rabbits. If a Gypsy catches rabbits, he says it's foxes. - If he catches a fox, he'll call it an elephant. - And if I catch an elephant?
Fine time to go hunting! Primitivo, climb up that rock as high as you can. If you see soldiers, throw a stone for a signal. Wait a minute. - If you see one soldier, raise your rifle like this.
- I know it. - Have you been through before? - Yes, Twice. - 8 hours, nearly 9 hours. - Can you make it to Navacerrada? - I can try.
- What? - It was under the ashes. - I thought you were guarding it. - I slept with your things! - You slept well!
- You haven't seen anyone! Father, you don't have any connection... No, monkey, hardly. I've been politically disconnected for over 15 years now. You tell it to A... A entrust it to B, B confines in C...
Die if you must, for a cause that's just.. but shout to the end: 'No Surrender'. Carry on, when we are gone. No surrender!" Of course you could made that a lot better. No, my friend... let's have it just as it stands. Fellow patriots, there's work to be done. Raise the invisible torch and pass it along... Keep it burning...
I'm always sorry. I bet you'd like to know what I'm going to give you for your birthday. - l'm dying to know. - Something to wear. - Let's see now. ls it a tie? - l'm not telling. I'll give you a hint.
- That's fine. Morning, Mother. - Good morning, Henry. Mother, I want you to look at this. - Do you think Martha will like it? - Oh, it's beautiful.
Insulin produces a state of coma. Then the patient is revived by a violent shock to the nerves. That shock can kill, but it can also cure. I don't know. It's a hard decision to make, but yours is only a technical responsibility. Technical responsibility. Real responsibility. The question is, will she live or die?
- It's just part of everyday life here. - You don't believe in it? A missionary's widow? Isn't very likely, is it? I don't mean believe in it like believing in a religion.
- You don't believe in it? A missionary's widow? Isn't very likely, is it? I don't mean believe in it like believing in a religion. I mean, do you believe it has power?
Why, I don't understand it. I put that money in the envelope and sealed it. It was never out of my sight until I put it into the safe. He's even used a copy of the Daily Planet. He never dropped it on the floor?
We were taken. This pair's crooked. Where's Wright? That money belongs to Miss Cowan. You know very well you stole it from her mother. Why, you.
Claudio. Erique Claudio. Claudio. No, no, no, it wouldn't be there. It's a large manuscript in a portfolio.
If it is, it will turn up. Call again in a few days. You don't understand, mademoiselle. It's the only copy I have. It represents two years' work. You heard what the lady said.
Call again in a few days. You don't understand, mademoiselle. It's the only copy I have. It represents two years' work. You heard what the lady said. But it was brought into this office.
I didn't recognize that delightful song you were singing, Christine. But as you know, I am no connoisseur of the opera. It's not from an opera, Raoul. It's a lullaby. A lullaby.
That ought to turn them back into us. That's a British Sudanese with an Italian prisoner. I think he's gonna fight us. Give me something white to wave. Make it snappy.
Quick! Something to catch the water! It's going to waste! Waco, get some cans and some ropes from the tank. Heads up. Here it comes.
Show them the way to Bir Acroma. The battalion will follow in an hour. We must get water. How's it coming? Very good, Sergeant. Very nice.
The battalion will follow in an hour. We must get water. How's it coming? Very good, Sergeant. Very nice. Any way to squeeze it out quicker?
We must get water. How's it coming? Very good, Sergeant. Very nice. Any way to squeeze it out quicker? It takes its own time.
Frenchie, let the Italian come around here. Yes, Sergeant. Let me take your place for a while. No, it isn't necessary. How's it coming?
Just the Army. In my village, we had the finest cheese in the world. - What kind of cheese, Frenchie? - It is from my village. Never heard of it.
Suppose we hold them up for two or three days while they're trying to get it. There's just one thing wrong with that plan. Here we are. Here are the Germans, and here's what happens. You hit it right on the nose.
Just give us our orders. That brings us down to cases. I look at it this way. Because it is a 100-to-1 shot. Because there's so little chance of any of us coming out of it.
- Got her filled? - Pretty sure of yourself, ain't you? I like to travel. It broadens the mind. I wish you weren't so cocky about it.
Water? You're giving guns for water! Go ahead! There it is! Drink all you can find! Go on, take it!
There it is! Drink all you can find! Go on, take it! There it is! Roll in it! Swim in it!
You know, it's the funniest thing. Sometimes I get a tune in my head like that and pretty soon, I hear somebody else humming it too. I think tunes jump from head to head. Do you know whatit is, Uncle Charlie? Uh, no.
Well, watch. You-You take one sheet here. OK? And you tear it down here. And you tear it there. You fold it over here at the side. Fold over the other side here.
- Yes, Sally. Then why don't you do something. Because Captain Vickery will be much safer in the local police station tonight than he would be in this house. Oh, Mr. Holmes, what am I going to do? Watson, get your sedative.
As my heir. Sally has to recite a sort of formula over Geoff's body in front of the fireplace and the library in the presence of the entire household. There, that's better. Just what sort of formula? Oh, it's some meaningless words, Musgrave ritual, they call it.
- No, no, not at all. But you had to speak them when you're brother Geoffrey took over. Yes, that's right, I did. Let me see now. "Who first shall find it were better dead
Yes, that's right, I did. Let me see now. "Who first shall find it were better dead Who next shall find it perils his head. The last to find it defies dark powers."
"Who first shall find it were better dead Who next shall find it perils his head. The last to find it defies dark powers." "Who first shall find it were better dead. Who next shall find it perils his head.
- Me, sir? - Yes, you. When Miss Sally forgot the lines today you were the one who prompted her. Well, sir I memorized it. Obviously but why?
There's only one thing to do, search the room. Not the room, Watson. Her mind. We must search her mind. Obviously, she took great pains to hide that paper.
I'll kiss the book on it. I've got it. She must have packed that paper under this cushion. She must have changed her mind. Obviously.
I've got it. She must have packed that paper under this cushion. She must have changed her mind. Obviously. Well she could have hidden it anywhere here.
"Neverfield and King's Hargrave Anno Domini 1539." What we're looking for is underneath here that's what the ritual meant by deep down low. It's a burial crypt. Up with it. I say, there's somebody down there.
What we're looking for is underneath here that's what the ritual meant by deep down low. It's a burial crypt. Up with it. I say, there's somebody down there. Who is it?
Is it Brunton? Is it Brunton? I don't know. Stay where you are. Who is it, Holmes?
That's why I let you take the torch first. I knew you'd snap it off. Yes. We told you, you were taking an awful risk. Well we had to have a confession and these egomaniacs are always so much more chatty when they feel they have the upper hand. Shall we go?
It's really a crown grant. What I don't understand is why the Musgraves didn't claim the land ages ago. Obviously Watson, one of 'em died before passing on the meaning of the ritual to his heir. The words remain but the sense was lost. I wonder why he left the grant down there where he found it.
Now why would Pettibone want American match folders in his work? And a microscope, most interesting. What's this? Watson this microscope was last used for examining microfilm. I'm beginning to see the pattern.
They're much too intelligent to believe that a corpse would frighten a trained detective. No, I rather think they intended this as a message and they wanted to be sure that I'd be here at the Hotel Metropolitan to receive it. Message? What do you mean? They want us to believe that they found the document and therefore have no further use for Grayson. Well if that's true then we're done for.
What do you mean? They want us to believe that they found the document and therefore have no further use for Grayson. Well if that's true then we're done for. I'm not so sure that it is true Watson. If they have the document why they wasting time sending me this? No.
It only remains to translate them properly. Yes, just as I thought. This blanket has had a most varied history. It's been on a many a sea voyage. The latest not six months ago.
That will be five hundred dollars. Now would you just give me the address where you want it sent? Mrs. J. Wellington, Junior, Duponte Circle. Good night.
She's not here of course but you're quite at liberty to look around if you care too. Thank you. Interesting piece. Spanish isn't it? Moorish. Oh, my error.
How could we two separate? Think of all we've given to each other. Look at that tree. Yes, it bows in sorrow. No, in longing.
Think of all we've given to each other. Look at that tree. Yes, it bows in sorrow. No, in longing. It grieves over us.
I pick him up. And as I found life at your breast he'll find life at mine. The tenderness you gave to me I give back to him. While I hum for him a song about us two. Isn't it lovely to think about? Yes.
While I hum for him a song about us two. Isn't it lovely to think about? Yes. It is only a dream. What does it matter?
I dreamed of a little child to hold in my arms. Not even that did you give me. You asked if I ever wished you were dead. I have wished it hundreds of times. I wished it when you were with me.
Not even that did you give me. You asked if I ever wished you were dead. I have wished it hundreds of times. I wished it when you were with me. I wished it when you left me.
No, no, of course not, of course not. Ratty old chair, ain't it? Repulsive. Well, sir, there's nothing ratty about it. Perhaps you're right, doctor.
Take your time with the packing, doctor, there's no hurry, you know. British Museum will still be there. (knocking) What's the row about? A registered package for Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Oh, he'll sign for it. Thank you, sir.
Please. I really shouldn't, but I must see it. Oh, how simply breathtaking. You like it? Why I'm mad about it.
Oh, how simply breathtaking. You like it? Why I'm mad about it. You must let me take it back to the jeweler, have it properly marked. AS or just Andrea?
Does he know that you're onto him? He does if he's the man I think he is. Don't be cryptic, darling. Look at that. What of it?
Oh, he is. Cigarette? Thank you. Yes, isn't it? I picked it up quite by accident.
Cigarette? Thank you. Yes, isn't it? I picked it up quite by accident. Wasn't a mark on it except some negligible fingerprints that the police couldn't identify.
- He's a lush, huh? Keep out of this! It's between us. You got something to tell me... You're wasting your time. - You know what's going to happen to him?
Stop all this. Now look, how did he die? Mortimer, don't be so inquisitive. The gentleman died because he drank some wine with poison in it. How did the poison get in the wine?
-But, darling, we were married today. -Go to bed, get some rest! Who? Judge Cullman? This is Mortimer Brewster. I'll tell you why I called you. It's about Teddy. I've got to come over and see you right away.
"A" like in "arsenic." Got that? Is there always this much noise? He doesn't live with us. I can see the headlines now. Please. I'd like to see the room.
A state secret? Yes, a state secret. Promise? You have the word of the President of the United States. Cross my heart and hope to die. Now, let's see.
I'll get every one of you! I hate cops. I'll brain the first one that comes near me! A little higher, brother. Thank you very much. Don't do that, please. That won't have any effect. I've tried it before--
What's that noise? Suppressed steam. Sometimes it goes on like that all night. - Really? - Yes. Maybe we'd better go to your house, huh? No, dear.
- What does it say? - I can't read it. I haven't got my glasses. - Here, hold this. I'll climb up and I'll see. - Never mind, I'll climb up.
Now, let's see, this knob. - Now, don't be frightened. Now, there, you'd hardly know there had been a spot on it. Gee, that's swell. That's a wonderful machine.
- Why? Because, properly detonated, it would blow up this entire city. What do you want us to do with it? I don't want you to do anything with it, except to guard it with your lives. The utmost secrecy must be observed.
Because, properly detonated, it would blow up this entire city. What do you want us to do with it? I don't want you to do anything with it, except to guard it with your lives. The utmost secrecy must be observed. If the wrong people learned what I have in mind and it was discovered, it might alter the whole course of the war.
I'm a very busy man I'm working on an aeroplane that requires no wings. How does it fly? That's just what I'm working on. Good night. He must have given me the wrong key.
That's just what I'm working on. Good night. He must have given me the wrong key. - Let me try it now. Maybe I can fix it. - All right.
Well, let's go. - I'll handle this. - Yes. Come on. That's deep enough.
Come on. Now, men, you're going to have an unusual opportunity for target practice under circumstances equivalent to actual warfare. At a deserted airfield, about two miles away there is an obsolete plane equipped with radio control and a robot plane. It will be flown directly over this battery and you will attempt to blow it out of the sky. All right, sergeant, start the plane.
The last to arrive on the glorious battlefield of Shiloh and the first to leave it! - You'll never live that one down, general. Never, ma'am. I made this myself, Mr. Cody. I hope you'll enjoy it.
You look beautiful. I wish your Indian brave could see you now. Indian! What is it? What did I say to offend you?
I wish your Indian brave could see you now. Indian! What is it? What did I say to offend you? Please, I'd rather you kept it.
Indian! What is it? What did I say to offend you? Please, I'd rather you kept it. It was so becoming to you.
No! What killed my son? Bill! Diphtheria. What's that?
What's that? It's a germ. Where does it come from? From water systems. From sewage.
I might even like you better. I'll tell you tomorrow. That's all, brother. This is where you live, beautiful. Not me. Lend me your car for a while?
Maybe you are, but let's take a look at that Dietrichson claim. Accident and double indemnity. You were pretty good in there for a while, Keyes. You said it wasn't an accident. Check.
Accident and double indemnity. You were pretty good in there for a while, Keyes. You said it wasn't an accident. Check. You said it wasn't suicide. Check.
Sure, right now. - I'm crazy about you, baby. - I'm crazy about you, Walter. That perfume on your hair. What's the name of it? I don't know.
You're awfully sweet. She was a nice kid. Maybe he was a little better than he sounded. But right then it gave me a nasty feeling to be thinking about them at all... with that briefcase right behind my head that had her father's signature in it... and what that signature meant. It meant he was a dead pigeon.
Until he can take the train. I told you it's got to be the train. But we can't wait. I can't go on like this. Look, we're not gonna grab a hammer and do it quick, just to get it over with. - There are other ways.
I'm not even crying. But I have the awful feeling that something is wrong... and I had that same feeling once before, when my mother died. When your mother died? We were at Lake Arrowhead. That was six years ago. We had a cabin there.
In the morning I really require very little. Just a little something. X is equal to negative P half plus or minus the root of P half in square minus Q the tangent one half ( Alpha plus Beta )... If the cocoa is not sweet enough for you... It's fine, it's fine.
But it's not genuine. Show me. On one end it goes back and forth, and on the other end it goes around. That is the connecting rod. Sometimes this kind of steam engine has two cylinders.
- What about a drink? - A drink? Well, you sure put us in a spot, didn't you? - Me? It was your idea.
- You will be careful, won't you? - I will. Goodbye. Goodbye. Come and see me if you're ever in London. My name is Thwaites, Miss Thwaites. I'll point out the window of the room in Number 9 where it happened.
I want a feeling of the early morning. - This morning. - Yes. With the sun rising, lighting your hair as it is now. I don't know how it ends.
Now, where should we put all these things? There is an attic under the roof. All her trunks are up there and all her costumes. Then we'll put all these there, too, and then we'll board it up... so you'll never have to see it again, never even think of it. That piano traveled with her everywhere in the great days.
I shall wear it always. Always, my dear. How sweet of you to give me this. I'm afraid the pin is not very strong. - No.
Please see that he has plenty of coal on the fire in his room. You already told me that, ma'am. Nancy, did you turn the gas up in there? Turn it up? No, why?
You already told me that, ma'am. Nancy, did you turn the gas up in there? Turn it up? No, why? I thought it went down in here, as if you had.
The little picture has been taken down. Who took it down? - Why has it been taken down? - Why indeed? Why was it taken down before?
Who took it down? - Why has it been taken down? - Why indeed? Why was it taken down before? Get it from wherever you've hidden it and put it back in its place.
Get it from wherever you've hidden it and put it back in its place. But I haven't hidden it. I swear I haven't. Why should I? Don't look at me like that.
- Can I send for a doctor? - No. If I can just get her home. We shouldn't have come tonight, but she was so anxious. I'm so sorry, Lady Dalroy. I think it's the most...
- The gas just went down. - You saw that, too? - Why, yes. Then it really happens. I thought I imagined it.
I didn't see anyone at all. But he was here. I know it. I know it. But he was here.
But he was here. I know it! I saw him. You see how it is, Elizabeth? Yes, sir.
Closer. Look into my eyes. If I ever meant anything to you, and I believe I did... then help me, Paula. Give me another chance. Look, in the drawer of that cupboard there is a knife.
Look, in the drawer of that cupboard there is a knife. Get it and cut me free. Be quick, Paula. Get me the knife. Cut me free. Would you get it, Paula?
Get it and cut me free. Be quick, Paula. Get me the knife. Cut me free. Would you get it, Paula? Would you get it for me?
Be quick, Paula. Get me the knife. Cut me free. Would you get it, Paula? Would you get it for me? Yes, I'll get it.
I don't know where I put them. That was a knife, wasn't it? And I have lost it. - Paula... - I must look for it, mustn't I?
That was a knife, wasn't it? And I have lost it. - Paula... - I must look for it, mustn't I? If I don't find it, you will put me in the madhouse.
And I have lost it. - Paula... - I must look for it, mustn't I? If I don't find it, you will put me in the madhouse. Where could it be, now?
- Paula... - I must look for it, mustn't I? If I don't find it, you will put me in the madhouse. Where could it be, now? Perhaps it's behind this picture.
If I don't find it, you will put me in the madhouse. Where could it be, now? Perhaps it's behind this picture. Yes, it must be here. No. Where shall I look now?
- Still looking for St. Dominic's. You just wait till I tell Father Fitzgibbon. Look, you keep out of this, will you? Go on. This is between him and me. O'MALLEY: Honestly, I'm sorry about the window.
You just wait till I tell Father Fitzgibbon. Look, you keep out of this, will you? Go on. This is between him and me. O'MALLEY: Honestly, I'm sorry about the window. Yeah, but being sorry don't fix it.
O'MALLEY: Here's something to tide you over. But, Father... It's all right. It's not charity. It's a loan. Thanks.
But, Father... It's all right. It's not charity. It's a loan. Thanks. I can use it.
I've been to the publisher. He wasn't interested. Wouldn't even look at it. Said they were loaded up. May I see it? - So you're still in trouble.
Wouldn't even look at it. Said they were loaded up. May I see it? - So you're still in trouble. - Wouldn't even look at it?
They say he's the sharpest little man in town. - I'm embarrassed. - You mean to talk business? The money? Don't let that embarrass you. We love it.
You see, it's not just the type of song that a guy would... Pardon me, Father, that a gentleman... would croon to his babe, if you know what I mean. It doesn't say enough. It hasn't got that... Well, it's just not for me.
Father O'Dowd and I thought, with your permission, we'd play golf tomorrow. I need a new golf ball. If I lose it, I'll swear off. I'll quit. Take 50 cents. No.
"The battle raged three days. "Eventually the Romans routed Hannibal's forces. "A great number were taken prisoner and brought before the consul. What is this? Using prohibited aids, Mr Widgren?
What is this? Using prohibited aids, Mr Widgren? I forgot to erase it. "Forgot to erase it"... But of course...
Tell me... Do you like me just a little? You see, I... Do you see that star? It seems to be hanging far below the sky on an invisible string.
You love him, don't you? He's in some kind of trouble, I think. - I want to help him. - You do love him. But he doesn't know it.
"On Friday night, Laura had a dinner engagement with me" "after which she was ostensibly going out of town." "She phoned and canceled our engagement at exactly 7:00." - After that I... - You "ate a lonely dinner," "then got into the tub to read." Why did you write it down?
- After that I... - You "ate a lonely dinner," "then got into the tub to read." Why did you write it down? Afraid you'd forget it? I am the most widely misquoted man in America. When my friends do it, I resent it.
How do you do, Lieutenant? I didn't know you were here, Mr. Carpenter. As a matter of fact, I was just lying down here. My hotel room was so hot, and then all the people and reporters and telephone. You know how it is, Lieutenant.
You've got a job. I concealed my annoyance with masterly self-control, but I sensed a situation which would bear watching. Laura, take a look at this. Do you like it? Do you think it'll make people want to bathe more often? It should.
I should have told you before. Shelby and I are going to be married next week. I believe you presented him with a cigarette case on his last birthday. Rather valuable, isn't it? Where did you get it?
Didn't you know Laura Hunt would come back any day and spill the whole thing? Or did you plan to kill her too, hide the body someplace and cover up your first crime? You're being fantastic, McPherson. You took a bottle of Black Pony to her house Friday night. I took it there over a week ago.
No, I didn't kill Diane Redfern or anyone else. Then why... Why did you tell me the radio at your country place was broken? - Because it was broken. - Not when I tried it.
She fell here. Waldo heard Shelby running from the next room so he hid in the stairway outside. Shelby was scared, so he ran out as fast as he could. Then Waldo came back and placed the gun in that clock. I knew it.
It's a beautiful coat. - Is it real mink? - I hope so. It's lovely. I've always admired mink.
I'm a great believer in science. Like tears, for instance. They're nothing but H2O with a trace of sodium chloride. He likes you, but he hates the bracelet. You will have to get rid of it. - The bracelet? - Mm-hmm.

They're nothing but H2O with a trace of sodium chloride. He likes you, but he hates the bracelet. You will have to get rid of it. - The bracelet? - Mm-hmm. I've worn it for 15 years. It's brought me nothing but good luck.

Shortly thereafter, that spirit was to rise again. The glorious day had come, when the first Croatian opera was to be shown in the theater on St. Mark's square in Zagreb. Perhaps countess Rubido will be offended because we did not attend that famous premiere of theirs, but as the president of the Musical Institute, I cannot afford to support dilettantism. I am surprised to see the countess engage in such a frivolous undertaking.
Even professor Kitl, the Conservatory director himself, gave composing and instrumentation lessons to Lisinski. During this time, "Porin", the second Croatian opera, was written. With the third act already completed, and having broadened his musical knowledge immensely during his stay in Prague, Lisinski returned to Zagreb full of hope. Gentlemen, please, just a few moments longer. We have come to the last item on our agenda.
Good day, gentlemen. Your Majesty. You do like that tune, don't you? Oh, I love it. It's the Notre Dame victory song.
Yeah, it's lucky horsemeat ain't rationed. Ollie, look. Stanley, we've got to uphold the rights of human beings. That beautiful sirloin steak is enough for at least four people. And he's hoarding it.
Ollie, look. Stanley, we've got to uphold the rights of human beings. That beautiful sirloin steak is enough for at least four people. And he's hoarding it. Mrs. Hawkley needs it more than that lion.
We'll do it. You're right, Ollie. Ladies first, I always say. Stanley. Get the meat. - You mean, me get the meat? - Of course.
I'll decoy him away from the meat, and you grab it. I'll pretend that I'm another lion. It's working. Pretend you're a lady lion. All right.
My first chance to cook a meal for the Hawkleys my famous Steak a la Oliver and no steak. I'm sorry, Ollie. - Look. - Look, the steak. Good boy, you got it.
I'm sorry, Ollie. - Look. - Look, the steak. Good boy, you got it. How'd you get it?
Why don't you try it on the other side? Well, I seem to have lost my touch. Stanley, a sharper knife, please. This one is very dull. The shortage of steel, you know.
No, no, Chris. Now, what you need is some sleep. Stanley, you wait here and I'll go and see if I can get a bed here for Chris. You seem awfully fond of that thing, Chris. I am. Knute Rockne gave it to my father.
Now, what you need is some sleep. Stanley, you wait here and I'll go and see if I can get a bed here for Chris. You seem awfully fond of that thing, Chris. I am. Knute Rockne gave it to my father. Put it under the pillow till morning.
His Majesty is giving a tea immediately after the presentation, and I want you to serve it. You ain't kidding? I ain't kidding. I give you my word. Will you do it?
Stanley, you may serve the special salad now. This one is His Majesty's. - Are you sure this is the largest one? - Of course it is. I picked it out myself.
Stanley. That's for the guest. Leave it alone. And put that down. Now look what you've done.
Won't we, Ollie? And now, gentlemen and Christopher if I may trouble you to climb out on the ledge outside this window. Come, come, gentlemen, please. I'm a very sensitive man. I find this quite painful.
Oh, you'll be quite safe. I have him under lock and key. Now to business. What luck? See for yourself. I stuffed it with paper to stop it from rattling.
What've you been up to? A little bit of hijacking, old boy. Reach into the inside pocket of that coat that you're about to throw aside. What do you find there? Pocketbook.
I beg your pardon. Are all the objects of art in this room connected with your protective system? Well, most of them but why? This Hogarth etching for instance, - is it connected? - Most certainly.
Lestrade's an idiot. Well, what the dear public don't know, the dear public won't worry about. That's funny. I had it here a moment ago. Extraordinary thing.
I had it here a moment ago. Extraordinary thing. Where can it be? I lifted it. Oh, what would Holmes do? I know, reconstruct the..
Light as a feather, ain't she? What did I tell you? Look at that, Lestrade. That china was broken after her dead body was flung there on the floor? But why, why was it done?
And there's too much china, Watson and too little plaster, which leads me to suspect that the greater conceals the less and if the china was smashed to cover up the plaster. Curious notion. Oh, look. Bird. Matter of fact I had thought of it myself. Oh, did you really?
Now we're driving about London looking at broken glass. Borgia Pearl... Here we are, sir. This is where I nabbed him. He was beating it along here like a frightened rabbit when I come up from behind and made the pinch. That isn't true.
Yes, Mr. Hodder. Oh, mercy me. Here, here. What have you broken now? I never saw such a one for breakage. You aren't even worth half the wages you earn.
He's addressing a meeting of the Royal Canadian Occult Society at a Quebec hotel. It's urgent sir. Page. Yes sir. Lord Penrose. La Morte Rouge is on the telephone.
It's quite all right. Oh thank you. Murder is a very interesting story gentlemen. I will recall a short story by that brilliant author G. K. Cheston in which the murder is committed by a postman I refer of course to the invisible man. A brilliant bit of deduction on the part of Father Brown. I'm a postman.
Good day sir. I'm sure Sergeant Thompson will have observed a man with a limp in a village the size of La Morte Rouge. This is what's left of the De Port Hotel Mr. Holmes. Tanner sleeps here when he's in La Morte Rouge. Spooky old place.
I'm sure Sergeant Thompson will have observed a man with a limp in a village the size of La Morte Rouge. This is what's left of the De Port Hotel Mr. Holmes. Tanner sleeps here when he's in La Morte Rouge. Spooky old place. Villagers call it the Wolf House.
Bravo Watson! Now if we can find the missing half... notice the discoloration of the torn edge, faded signature, the upper half was torn off some time within the last year I should say. Why all this fuss about an old photograph? Watson have you ever stopped to think that the science of detection is very much like stringing a hand full of beads? I can't say that I have.
You were gonna give it back to him, of course? No, I wasn't. - I don't like him. - That's a pretty good reason. Besides, I need boat fare to get out of Martinique.
- You mean he had rented it. The tickets in his wallet show he was to leave Martinique at daylight. There was no money on him or in his wallet. Only some American traveler's checks. Was that customary with him?
They're not so hot, either. Would you like to hear them? Sure. So it goes. - That's about as far as it goes.
You're not sore, are you? - It'd be all right... - I got a refund on that ticket. Here. That's gonna help a lot.
Then take this. - What is it? - Chloroform. Get over by his head. If he comes to while I'm probing... pour some of it on a hunk of cotton and give him a whiff of it.
- Goodbye. - Bye. - Goodbye. - Bye. - Goodbye. Just what is this, my dear? Well, it said coffee on the bag.
But blowing up a bridge, killing a whole trainload of Germans, that counts. A handful of peasants is a cheap price. It's breaking your heart because you know a couple. Jean. Let me put it to you this way, supposing you knew the saboteur? Supposing it was your brother or someone you loved?
- They're my clothes! You're not good at it. Your records are old. Don't listen, then! You're rich now.
Oh, you know... Micheline is doing a fitting. - Is your line ready? - I don't know... I think it'll be grand.
Thank you. You seem sincere. Listen. There are things I never told women. They thought I loved them, or not. But I never said it.
The train's gone now. Let's get out of here. Hurry up! This isn't all fun and games! - Is it going well? - Yes.
- Did you hear a shot? - No. - That's funny, neither did I. - Why, something happen? - Nicky, what is it?
- Who'd like some cider? - Nick. Oh, Nick, here's the bullet. I don't know about such things, but I imagine it was fired from a.45 or something in that general field. - Well, give it to Mac.
Break it up there! My, my. Cut it out, will you? Come on. Give me the police department, please.
Well, you certainly got right down to business. I found her on the floor. She was out cold. Somebody had conked her before I got here. - What about the painting? - It's gone.
Let's see. Peter Berton painted it. Everybody wanted it. Draque offered 500. Mrs. Draque got it. She got conked.
Peter Berton painted it. Everybody wanted it. Draque offered 500. Mrs. Draque got it. She got conked. Let's see, now, who else wanted it?
Say, you are worried, aren't you? Oh, I've handled trickier shows than this. But your old man wasn't in the audience watching you. That's it, isn't it? Or part of it anyway.
- I don't know. Why don't you sit down and take it easy. I'll just make some cocoa to quiet their nerves. Cocoa? What a break.
I worked that out before her mouth shut. - You mean there ain't no posse? - Sure, and it's probably trailing' us. There wouldn't be if she hadn't sicked it on us. Are you telling me that there pretty lady is a skunk?
- Now, look, I'm sick and tired... - I'm gonna smoke a cigarette. When I'm done, I'm gonna throw it away. When I throw it away, take care of yourself. Some friend of this belly-bustin' gunman, I take it.
- Made up your mind? - Uh-huh. Well, where is it? - Where's what? - The money. Stop stalling.
- A what? - A dead body. That's the way the law says it. If they've got a corpus, you're delict. Before this, we could have proved there was a mistake.
That'll teach you to keep your mouth shut. Come on. Come on? Try any monkey business and I'll blow you clear outta this house. Where's that money?
Yeah? Yeah. But I ain't gonna help you with it none. I'm gonna make you ask about it. All right.
Cold, eh? - That better? No mortal cold, Sally. It's a cold from beyond the grave. What are you talking about?
No mortal cold, Sally. It's a cold from beyond the grave. What are you talking about? Believe it or not, this house is haunted. - I don't believe it.
By the end of this evening, I shall be just as credulous as any of you. Mr Craig, I can only say the more incredulous the doctor becomes the more I believe you. - Thank you. Doctor, I'd hoped you'd be able to explain to me a happening which, to put it mildly, has always puzzled me. I shall try.
I remember the date, because it was Peter's birthday. 'You know how difficult it is, choosing presents for a man. 'They always seem to have everything they want.' - Oh, hello, darling. - Hello, sweet.
- Oh, hello, darling. - Hello, sweet. Take it through, will you? - What on earth's that? - Just a little birthday present.
No, of course not. Why? Well, when I was dressing this evening, just as I was tying my tie, What do you mean, "wrong"? Well, it wasn't my room I was seeing, it was some other room. - Darling! - I told you it sounded silly.
You'll feel much better if you do. It's no good bottling things up. Well at first, if I made an enormous effort of will, the reflection used to change back to what it ought to be. But lately, however hard I try, it doesn't change anymore. The only thing to do is to try not to look in it at all.
Do you remember that Chippendale mirror I bought here 3 months ago? Indeed I do. I hope your husband was satisfied with it. Yes, very. - How odd you should mention it.
Ever since Mr Craig arrived, you've been asking me to produce scientific explanations like rabbits out of a hat. I am not accustomed to solving complex problems with the careless ease of your Brains Trust. Sounds to me as though you're completely stumped this time. Joan saw the room in the mirror as well as Peter. The witness I couldn't supply you with.
Hear that, Nathalie? It's contagious! Another pillar of salt. Ah, love! It cheers the heart. - Same old story? - Same old story!
- On credit? - If not, I'd live elsewhere. Are you sure you don't want the second-floor flat? No, really, a small room is fine. What a shame!
Oh, no. I stayed with some friends. We found the door open, so we came in. How did you get that cut? I bumped into a man carrying some baskets a little while ago.
Did you... do anything this time? Not that I can recall. Where could I have got this? - I'll throw it away. - No.
Maybe tomorrow. Could you finish it tonight, while I'm resting, I mean? Well, I guess I could. Well, then you could... bring it over after a while. But I think it'd be awfully late, Netta.
Well, then you could... bring it over after a while. But I think it'd be awfully late, Netta. It wouldn't matter how late, George. - Who is it? - It's I, George.
But I think it'd be awfully late, Netta. It wouldn't matter how late, George. - Who is it? - It's I, George. I've just finished it.
It wouldn't matter how late, George. - Who is it? - It's I, George. I've just finished it. You said to bring it over.
I've just finished it. You said to bring it over. May I come in and play it to you? Well, it's... it's awfully late, George.
Well, it's... it's awfully late, George. But you said it didn't matter how late. Well, darling, I've just been asleep. I'll just look at it.
it's awfully late, George. But you said it didn't matter how late. Well, darling, I've just been asleep. I'll just look at it. But I've... I've worked awfully hard to finish it.
- Good night, Netta. Send for a cab, will you? Thank you. Blimey, but it's hot. I'm watching out for a load of gas pipe.
I'm sorry. There's a deep bruise on her throat. She says he threw something round her neck. It was probably a cord with a knot in it. That's what caused the bruise.
It was probably a cord with a knot in it. That's what caused the bruise. It acted like a thuggee cord. Thuggee? What's that?
It acted like a thuggee cord. Thuggee? What's that? It's a method of very swift and silent murder. - But what could...
It's always one more. They get stale so fast I never have time to do anything else. I won't do it. But I must have it, dear. - I open next week.
Try it once. Netta, it isn't a waltz. That's not the right tempo. Darling, it would be for my song! You can't have it.
That's not the right tempo. Darling, it would be for my song! You can't have it. It belongs to the concerto. Oh, George.
Darling, it would be for my song! You can't have it. It belongs to the concerto. Oh, George. It's such a little thing.
That's my song. Listen. Play it once. Waltz tempo. Go on.
When two... When two lips Breathe aflame This is our moment For gay love
I see no reason why... - Remember the Guy, sir. - Fifth of November. - Remember the fifth. - I'd forgotten it was Guy Fawkes Day.
That's not true. Netta... it's not true, is it? Why haven't you told me about it before? - I tried to, George. - My dear fellow...
How did you know that she had them? It's obvious my dear Watson, since Mr. Davis was not at dinner, Mrs. Monteith had no opportunity to deliver the envelope. Yes of course, quite obvious. Where'd you find it?
It's not often we have the opportunity at meeting such charming people. You go ahead I'll follow you. I'm afraid, Mr. Holmes, if you don't go with the sergeant there's no way to get back to the village tonight. Oh but Mr. Holmes, there's no need for you to stay at the inn. It's such a dreary place.
You'll find him like the others, a corpse. Don't you worry gentlemen it's only just a question of time before we catch Captain Simpson. He couldn't have got far. My men will soon apprehend him. You know this rather reminds me of a very similar account when I brought about the undoing of the notorious Professor Moriarty.
NARRATOR: Vigilant, tireless, implacable. The most silent service of the United States in peace or war is the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Bureau went to war with Germany long before hostilities began. No word or picture could then make public the crucial war service of the FBI.
No fingerprints were listed under the name of Francisco Ruiez. But regardless of name, once his print was classified a search for the individual's identity was a simple matter. TECHNICIAN: There's something coming now. Yeah, it's in cipher. This stuff is fugitive.
Tomorrow night? That's a tough order. I've got to put this in code. It'll take time. Orders are not to be questioned.
Now let's get back to this envelope. Where did you take it? I was told to take it to a house on 92nd Street. -And who told you to take it there? -I don't know.
-Find anything? -We found the typewriter and checks. That's the one that was used to copy the data. Then Roper is the man who's been getting it out. -Shall we pick him up?
Every person who entered or left the store was being photographed by FBI agents from an office directly across the street. LANGE: Can I help you? -Yes, I believe you can. LANGE: Are you looking for a particular book? Yes, but I can't find it.
Now, you and Conrad take this out there. Stay there while he puts it into code. Make sure that he sends it... ... becauseeverything depends on you getting that through. -He'll send it.
Now, you know perfectly well that nothing I could say about you-- The way you look, I mean, could be anything but flattering. - Of course, if you don't like flattery-- - But I do. On second thought, it won't be flattery.
You must be. You haven't had dinner, have you? - Nor lunch. - You poor thing, you must be famished. Mrs. Robie told Emily to leave you a tray. Good.
- What is it? - Turkey. Wild turkey. - Ever hunted them? - No, I haven't. It's tricky shooting. They're sort of scary, but they're so big and clumsy, they hate to take wing.
- All right, you can rest. - Oh. Ellen, you shouldn't have walked up those stairs. You know what the doctor told you. Come here and sit down. What have you done with Father's lab?
I hate the little beast. I wish it would die! Ellen! Shocked, aren't you? If you were having the baby, you'd love it.
Hello, Dr. Saunders? This is Ruth Berent. Please come over at once. Something terrible has happened. Well, we couldn't save the child.
The alarm clock goes off, you open your eyes... brush your teeth and read the Daily Mirror. You ever lie in your bed, looking at the window? A little daylight's coming through, and you start to wonder. Is it getting lighter? Is it getting darker?
A little daylight's coming through, and you start to wonder. Is it getting lighter? Is it getting darker? Is it dawn or is it dusk? That's a terrifying problem.
- That's what is says... 417. - I don't care what it says. - The checks must've gotten mixed up. - Maybe they did. Find my coat.
Good luck to you. You had another bottle. You know you did. Where did you put it? You're not crazy. Where did you put it?
Standing room only. Prohibition: That's what started most of these guys off. Now, be a good boy and drink this. - I don't want it.
After all, you're just a freshman. Wait till you're a sophomore. That's when you start seeing animals. You know that stuff about pink elephants? That's bunk.
It's finished. It's dead. For three years, they couldn't talk me out of you. I was the only one that really understood you. I knew there was a core of something. Well, there is.
- Stop lying to me. Give it to me! All right. Now, go. No fuss, please. And don't call the neighbors.
- About a messed-up life. About a man and a woman and a bottle. About nightmares, horrors, humiliations... all the things I want to forget. Put it all down on paper. Get rid of it that way. Tell it all: "To whom it may concern."

Pick out something you like, and I'll play it for you. Oh, here's one I know. This one. What, again? Do you know it?

But till that mornin' With daddy and mammy Most of the audience loved it. What did the critics say? Some of them said it wasn't opera. Why wasn't it opera? Just because ordinary people liked it?
You leave Johnny out of this! With your looks and figure you could get any man you want. Sure, but there's only one I want. Yeah, and he's making a tramp out of you. You wouldn't know love if it hit you in the face!
I was... I was looking for the paper. Are you blind? No. Didn't you... didn't you like the radio?
Well, don't break the bank! Hello, Lazy Legs. I thought I heard the doorbell. I didn't hear anything. Say, is this all you've got?
I'll come here tomorrow at noon, Kitty. I'll be waiting for you. I'm sorry you have to go... Bye-bye, Dear. - Don't forget the money!

2000 dollars... on your life. Adele collected it. It's really yours, isn't it? She keeps it right in her bedroom. Now I wouldn't touch a penny of it, Mr. Higgins, but... if you took it, it would be perfectly legal.
Why, I've got to be able to say that I didn't touch it. You know Adele... What if she don't go out... and I show up... Your goose is cooked, isn't it? Yes, but...
That was my car! This is yours, too. It's got your initials on it, but it's her blood. Here's 140 dollars that was taken out of her pocketbook. That was mine.
She didn't have any more use for it, did she? Listen you guys, I want a lawyer! I'm a citizen, I got my rights! This belongs to you too, huh? It's got your fingerprints on it.
You'll think I came in to hear that. I know why you came in. Why? Because something has happened to us. But it doesn't happen like that, in a day. It happens in a moment sometimes.
I felt it this afternoon. It was like lightning striking. It strikes rarely. I don't understand how it happened. - What is it?
You're trying to tell yourself something. What it is, we'll figure out later. There's a lot more to it. Go on and try to recall the details. The more cockeyed, the better for the scientific side of it.
Do you remember Angel Valley? No. We can call a travel agency and check all the resort names. It wasn't Angel Valley. I remember it.
You've got a temperature a little over 103. Chew these sulfur pills. What is this, shrapnel? Where did you get it? Cavite.
Are you coming back? I'm not sure. But I don't think so. Well, this is really goodbye, then. It's been awfully nice, hasn't it?
Oh, it's all right. It's 184. It's 481. Well, you try all of them. I always do. You'll find it.
You see this book? It's logical, it's clear, it's honest. It doesn't tell you one thing today and another thing tomorrow. It doesn't double-cross you. It's beautiful.
What are you doing in your dinner jacket? Aren't we dressing for dinner at your mother's house tonight? - I see. - You do? Well, that's fine. You overdid it again, as you say, didn't you?
Don't be a dope. Go and consolidate your position. What do you mean? Say, look, I usually charge for unpleasant work like this. - Oh, I get it, I get it.
Patrick Jamieson, ma'am. - Are you single? - Oh, yes, ma'am. Very much so. Well, that's also unfortunate. I wanted a couple. Something in the nature of superior caretakers for this place which I intend to offer for sale furnished as it is. I'm sure I could show it off to the best possible advantage, ma'am.
Backwards, forwards, every which way but chiefly forwards. Well, I hope that means that you've decided to stop living in the past. Yes, that's it. I got to thinking maybe you're right. It is stupid of me.
Well, I hope that means that you've decided to stop living in the past. Yes, that's it. I got to thinking maybe you're right. It is stupid of me. It is selfish.
- Thank you. Jamie Jamieson. Be kind of a pretty name. Don't think I didn't think of that. How's it feel?

- Where? - In the funny paper. Let's try the oxygen valve. Doorbell. - Anna's gone out.
Kitty, I wouldn't dream of it, it looks such fun. It often is. Often? Does it really happen to you often? Well, not anymore so than is good for me.
I just hope you've brought some sleeping pills with you. Never use drugs. Hey, what's that? Oh, this is a little invention of mine. Hello, Diz.
Very curious. Curious, what's curious? That window in the empty house across the street, first floor front. Oh, what's wrong with it? It's open.
Curious, what's curious? That window in the empty house across the street, first floor front. Oh, what's wrong with it? It's open. Why shouldn't it be open?
Waters of forgetfulness. Steady, deep, strong. Strange, isn't it, how the light is reflected. Little specks of light that move and move. It's restful here. It's peaceful.
But it won't look like suicide, sir. I'm sorry, but Mr. Holmes' injuries must all be self-inflicted. Let's walk a little, Mr. Holmes. It's so pleasant here in the garden. Just step up here onto the terrace.
- When will it be over? There are times when I can't take any more. It seems like we'll never get out of this hell. It'll be over, Pina, and spring will come back, and it'll be even more beautiful because we'll be free. We have to believe in it.
Sure you do. This one here. I applied it to relieve the pain. - And it still hurts? - Not for some time. But to be sure, you always carry it.
- And it still hurts? - Not for some time. But to be sure, you always carry it. I wanted to return it to the dentist. That explains it.
Monsieur Duclois. A very important man to the Germans. Burn that face, that picture, into your memory... because the success of your mission, and subsequently... the destruction of the target, is linked to that man. - Duclois. - Duclois. - Duclois. - Well, what is his connection with the bomb depot?
I don't feel at ease in all this finery, and i'm not used to being waited on. But i sense you are doing everything possible to help me forget your ugliness. I have a good heart, but i am a monster. There are men far more monstrous than you, though they conceal it well. Besides being hideous, i'm not quick-witted.
I swear. Come. Look over there, belle. Do you see that pavilion? It's called diana's pavilion.
An elegant woman, and father standing at her side! And us without our finery! It's belle! - Belle? Impossible.
I'm going to be married. Oh, someone I've known for years. Someone I love very much. Alex, I implore you, don't take it like this. But I can't help it. How else could I say it?
Tell me, are you a musician? - Cellist, yes. - Extraordinary thing, teaching a person. - Pygmalion and all that. - Yes, I was surprised to hear you did it.
You were scared too. I saw it when you came in. But I've been playing it all the afternoon. I have it. It's so wonderful. What a creation. It's something I never hoped for or dreamed of.
Alex, I think I'd rather walk. Good luck. This concludes the 1 a.m. Edition of worldwide news. The following is transcribed. Remember, folks, when you spell Drawrof backwards, it reads forward.
He's... Well, he's like a man who's coming out of the darkness into the light. And, well, Hollenius wants to put him back into the darkness. First he offers him this wonderful opportunity. - He's gonna take it away. - I can't believe it.

I remember that street. - Do you love me? - Yes. But I can't forget your street. I remember every little thing about it.

It's mine! It's all mine now! It's mine, I found it! It's mine! Mine.
Oh, but I am. Well, you put me at a very awkward position. I'm a collector you know and a collector buys but never sells. But if the price were high enough. The price has nothing to do with it.
Sergeant Thompson is following them, sir. They won't get away from him, he's a good man. He could have arrested them at Kibbutz's Toy Shop if we had any proof. But we know that they killed Emery. Proof, my dear fellow, we must have proof.
- There you are. - Thank you, Joe. What's it mean, Holmes? You on to something? Perhaps. I don't know yet.
Behind books, third shelf, secretary, Doctor 'S'. Presumably, these are the first and second portions of the message. And this gang has the first and third parts of it. - Precisely.
- What's the matter with you? - "Women and gambling don't mix." My wife isn't just a "woman". - I could've made a mistake. - You did. Don't make it again.
I would like permission to dance with your lady. - The answer is no. - The answer is yes. I'd love it. - But the young man...
What's the matter? You're very excited about something. Perhaps it's in the air. Perhaps you shouldn't have opened the window. Close it.
At two the next day you'll be free! I didn't think I'd ever trust another man, but here I go again. Thanks, Tom. - Tom, this is the Hotel Centenario. - I was told it's a good hotel.
Lookit here. From Tahiti, the Fiji islands, the Coral Sea. A new magazine. I never saw it before. Of course you never.
- Uncle Billy, telephone. - Who is it? - Bank examiner. - Bank examiner? I should have called him yesterday.
- How much this cost? - No charge. That's my trick ear, Joe. It sounded like you said "no charge." That's right. Well, what's my name doing on it? A little present from old man Gower.
Champagne! By the way, where are you two going on this here now honeymoon? Where are we going? Look at this. There's the kitty, Ernie.
George, can I see you a minute? - Why didn't you call me? - I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George. This is a pickle. All right, now, what happened?
If you close your doors before 6:00 p.m., you will never reopen. George, was it a nice wedding? Gosh, I wanted to be there. Yeah. You can take this one off now.
I can't think anymore. It hurts. Where's that money, you silly, stupid old fool? Where's that money? Do you realize what this means?
- Bless you! Did you bring the wreath? Yes, Daddy, did you bring the Christmas wreath? What wreath? The Merry Christmas wreath for the window. No. I left it at the office.
- This way. Upstairs. Just got in town. Fella runs the lunchroom down the street said you had a roomer here. Name of Lunn, somethin' like that. Said he died. Thought the room might still be empty. It still is empty.
The harder the wind blows, the hotter it gets. We call that wind the Santa Ana. It comes from the desert. Nick, why don't you let me take your car, I'll run that sign into town and get it fixed. Okay.
- Oh. What's the difference if they do get dirty? I got them washed for free. [SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] Right then, I should have walked out of that place but I couldn't make myself do it.
- I was only joking. - Were you? - Yes, I was. - Or had you started to think about it? - I didn't really mean it.
Well, I'm... I'm going to sell it. I'm superstitious. I... Never turn down a good offer.
- After that, I can go through anything. - All right, let's get down there. We gotta mess ourselves up to prove we've been in the accident too. - Right. - Come on.
- All right, let's get down there. We gotta mess ourselves up to prove we've been in the accident too. - Right. - Come on. It's hardly smashed up at all.
I tried, but nobody could have stopped you. However, now that you've got it off your chest... - Kennedy. MAN: Yes, sir? That confession Mrs. Smith signed, what did you do with it?
We... We took a life, didn't we, Frank? Well, now we can give one back. Then maybe God will forgive us and maybe it'll help square us. Maybe it will.
I have a little. That's what gives me the chance to do what I want. You're making it very difficult for me. I'm sorry, darling. I wouldn't if I could help it.
What have the other Poles told you about me? Not much. They advised me not to play cards with you because you cheat. - Do you think it's true? - Yes.
Like listening to music by moonlight. It is. Sophie. - Yes? - I saw the most divine wedding dress at Molyneux's.
Sometimes when I've been alone I've wanted to shake the house down. But I've quit. - Yesterday at the Ritz was tough going. - I know, I saw it. Did you?

Faded the shape of beauty From my arms Faded the voice, warmth Whiteness, paradise Vanished unseasonably at shut of eve My advice is that you go and have a good dinner. I have a card here of one of the best restaurants in Toulon.
Well, really now, young Mr. Larry Darrell that's the most sensible thing I've ever heard you say. Of course he's right. It's only a temporary indisposition. I'm lunching with a duke on Sunday and I've told my doctor he must put me to rights by then at all costs. It's too bad this should have happened just now.
I thought I was being so noble, remember? Look at me, Larry. You know you love me. You know that you've always wanted me. Say it's true.
- Café. Called the Cellar. Because it's in a cellar. Lots of guys get loaded there and then come over here to sweat it out. - Maybe you oughta ask there about your pal. - What time's it open? How do I know?
I never touch it. It keeps me awake. You better have some. You're going to be pretty sleepy this afternoon. That was some drop- two million bucks. How's a thing like that happen? Well, it's a long story. Don't ask for details, but here's most of it.
It started over in Germany when one of the Nazi hotshots saw the handwriting on the wall. He sent the two million over here. And then before he could come over after it... he got knocked off by one of the fellow members of the lodge. And here was this big chunk of dough floating'around loose in this country... like a pair of dice at a firemen's ball. It moved east to west.
And then before he could come over after it... he got knocked off by one of the fellow members of the lodge. And here was this big chunk of dough floating'around loose in this country... like a pair of dice at a firemen's ball. It moved east to west. Each time it moved, it left a stiff behind it with his fingers stretched out. The boys play rough for that kind of lettuce, you understand.
How did you know where to find me? I didn't know I was going to find you. I got a note that said Larry Cravat was at 42111/2 Summit. - I don't get it. - From whom was the note?
- He's homicide. - He steals fried shrimps. He wants to help, and so do I. You asked me to, remember? What kind of trouble is Taylor in? It won't make any difference to me. Maybe it will.
My head- My head hurts. Are you Conroy? Michael Conroy. My daughter, she'll worry. Will someone- Her name is Elizabeth.
The war's very young yet. Sure. Sure. It's only 1942, isn't it? My back - Now my back's beginning to hurt. Conroy, the other night, a couple of nights ago, maybe... a man was murdered on the dock. - You saw it. - Yes. I saw it.

- Well, Phyllis? - I don't know. It - It could be. I don't know for sure. After all, I only met him once. I'm Larry Cravat. You can take my word for it. - I do.

Afternoon, Mr Wilson. Afternoon, Noah. Bring them right in there, Mr Peabody. What does the law say about this kind of murder? is it the same as killing a man?
But the proof that murder is his aim would be the strongest evidence she could have. {clock strikes} Charles. Listen. it's striking. After 100 years.
I hope you haven't forgotten you were kind enough to invite me. - No, of course not. - Mr Potter asked me to deliver this. - Good. Sara's waiting for it.
Every attendant has a key. Did you open this door for anyone during the last hour? No sir. Was the key ever out of your possession? It never is, sir.
I resent that sir. Sherlock Holmes is very full of integrity. Might even be an accomplice. Oh well if I were a policeman I'd take you and charge this very moment. I didn't do it sir.
There may be coppers watching the place. Inspector, I guess where I'm going, I won't need these. He's got Johnny. You are lucky. You get the cell with the gramophone. It belonged to barry, Him who chopped off his uncle's head. Oh.
5 ago. It's broke, the record, in the middle. It won't go any further. It keeps playing the same thing over and over again. Please don't do that. You know, it gets on the prisoners' nerves. I imagine it would. It's very simple. I'll show you.
How can I rest? I must have that ticket. A man is waiting on the corner with a check only a block away. I must have it! Make her give it to me, Mr. West. Make her give it to me now! Or it will be too late!
- You take them off? - Of course. I'll get your money. It's a 500? Yes, I just sold it.
- Of course. I'll get your money. It's a 500? Yes, I just sold it. It's a great machine.
900? It's expensive. I need another book, I finished mine. The Ace of Clubs. Is this one any good? I don't know. Take it.
The Ace of Clubs. Is this one any good? I don't know. Take it. It helps me pass the time. I don't want to take it out now.
A wallet? You believe in Santa Claus? Do you know the number? 139 800. Block it. Say you lost it. Then no one else can use it.
Look, Gallagher, I know this drum's full of crackpots. One con's gonna buy his way out. Another knows the governor's cousin. A third guy's even gonna float out in a homemade balloon. But I'm not buying any pipe dreams. It can be done. It's been done before, and it'll be done again.
What are you talking about? Tom! Oh, Tom, darling. Here, put it on. It's beautiful.
We sent some men out in a boat. They landed up here. We covered 'em with a heavy bombardment. At "H" hour, we attacked uphill. The Krauts turned all their guns to stop us. That was exactly when the other gang attacked from behind.
Come on, Collins. Come on. What's the plan now? The plan's a flop. You're on your own. It's a million-to-one. He's trying to ram the gates!
- That's not Malaga. - No, señor. Tell me about the Indies, señor. That word sets your imagination on fire, doesn't it? Well, why not?
- Yes. Well, then, by your leave, I'll ride with you. - Girl. Have the boy bring my animal too. - Sí, señor. And, uh, here. - This'll fetch you a new dress. But it's gold.
I hadn't seen you. - Take the ring back. - Oh, no, no. - Take it back! - No. Keep it till tomorrow.
And I had a door built. - Where's the lock to this chest? - Right here. That's odd. This has been filed. The Indians have no steel.
In the practice of true science, God often lends a hand. You may think that anyone can lay a hot iron on an open wound. Far from it. It has to be timed to the very split of a second. Had I removed the iron too soon, the wound would not have seared.
If one can't retreat, he must go forward. If we survive this expedition, gentlemen... the order I have given to destroy this armada... will go down in history as a monument to our resolution and courage. If we fail, it doesn't matter, as history will forget us. Sir, this is not an attack. It's a peaceful mission.
If we survive this expedition, gentlemen... the order I have given to destroy this armada... will go down in history as a monument to our resolution and courage. If we fail, it doesn't matter, as history will forget us. Sir, this is not an attack. It's a peaceful mission. - How do you know, de Vargas? Maybe it's a trick.
Sure, you can stay, but you shouldn't. I need a week. - The cops may be on their way right now! - I can't travel with this face. It's plastered all over the papers.
I'm going there tonight. Plastic surgery? - That costs money. - I've got plenty. A girl named Irene Jansen gave it to me.
My method is based partly on calling a spade a spade. I don't monkey around. - Have you got the money? - Yeah, you want it now? Sam said you could afford $200.
You won't feel any pain with this. I'll give you some shots that'll freeze your face. Now, just close your eyes. I've got a fine anesthetic. Used it in the last war.
Now you'll be safe. It's time, Vincent. It's time for the bandages to come off. I know it's awfully early... but you said you wanted to get away before it got light. How does your face feel?
But it's good. I think I even like you better. Don't let it give you any ideas. - What kind? - Don't change yours.
- Tell me or I'll shoot it out of you. - I didn't see any car! If you want to walk away from here, tell me if it's the same car I think it was. I haven't got a thing to lose. Not a thing.
You told yourself you were rid of me and nobody else could have me. It's all written down here. That's no evidence. That's just the way you figure it. That's why you're after a confession, isn't it?
I liked that. You mean you... You really liked them? Sure. You forget everything. I was up for the Navy cross.
Do they really? By Jove, they probably do. Well, well. - I was wondering if you'd mind talking about it. - Not at all. Not at all.
May he rot and swell and split himself inside out. With coals of fire in his belly may he die slowly. Better you put that coat on, liebling. Coat? Thank you, I'm not cold.
I say to myself, "This will be my man." Liebling, you are my man. Mine. - Nothing can change that. - Never mind that nonsense. How did you find out about me and the escape and the rest of it?
Tonight would you be entertaining the chief of police... these Nazi party officials and elite guard officers... if you weren't forced to? - They suspect, Otto. - Let them. And if they searched me, would they ever suspect this, uh... piece of money? - Let me keep it.
But I won't say goodbye to myself, just because I love someone who demands it as a matter of course. One imagines things differently to how they are, and forgets coincidence. Here we stand under your beautiful old plane-tree by this small avenue which branches off from my street and leads only to you. It's early morning, it's cold, and we're reaching a decision. And it all seems as if it were meant to be so.
Yes. - And what did you say? This morning I said no. Then perhaps it was a happy day, if a bit different. No! Don't scratch it out.
- There you are! You see, Angela, a concert tour is as much work as Papa's job in the museum, isn't it? It's not a pleasure trip. Quite the contrary. And this time it'll be a hard-fought battle.
My white letters are enough. "Bienert Frames" is our name. That's all people need to know. Don't act dumb. Everyone knows it's been signed over to me.
I don't know what's up. A problem with the engine? - No. No water. - Is that dangerous?
Oh yes, of course. Perhaps I can get a train here to Well? I can't keep it in my head. Illingenworth!
Perhaps I can get a train here to Well? I can't keep it in my head. Illingenworth! May I write it down?
I interviewed him for my paper, The Real France. Have you heard of it? I published it in November 1940. Yes. 1940... That took some courage back then, to risk yourself in such an adventure.
Burglars might break in. What nonsense. Good thing we haven't any servants. It's perfectly safe tonight. Should have been left where it was.
Yes, I have a job. If I lose one, I can always find another. Peter, don't pull the cat's tail. You have a cruel streak. Where do you get it? I'm only playing with him.
Silly, carrying on this way. I was beginning to lose faith. Then this happens and you want to believe all over again. This is a ruthless world and one must be ruthless to cope with it. That isn't true.
It's for the woman next door. I'm worried about the deed to this house. I want it back in my name. - Why, of course. - We can go to the lawyer's now. - Today?
Just remember, I've got a 3 o'clock train to meet. Thank you, I'll be brief. Colonel brewton, How much cattle range do you control? I've heard it runs into a million or more acres. I've never counted them.
Made to order for farming. Yes, I suppose it is just grass to most. But not to you, jim? To me, it's land the way god made it And wants it to stay. And I may be wrong but I've got a hunch That he wants me to help him keep it that way.
But not to you, jim? To me, it's land the way god made it And wants it to stay. And I may be wrong but I've got a hunch That he wants me to help him keep it that way. I know it's too soon to expect you to see it that way, lutie
To me, it's land the way god made it And wants it to stay. And I may be wrong but I've got a hunch That he wants me to help him keep it that way. I know it's too soon to expect you to see it that way, lutie But you will see it some day.
You're really fond of sam and selina hall. Selina was my first friend out here. I'm awfully glad she doesn't seem lonely. Did you expect her to be? Well, this is the place for it. Hardly a woman'country. It could be.
I love selina, and right now, she hates me. There's nothing I can do, lutie. This would only happen again, or something similar. It figured to happen. This tough country, lutie. This country, I'm sick to death Of talking about this country. You really think it's more important
Neither do we. But that out there does... And men like chamberlain, they want to farm it. They want to dig it up and draw the water out of its veins, Let the sun get at it, way down deep. It would curl up and die then, lutie, It would be dead, and so would the whole country, It would never live again.
Mr. Charles, I think you have this all wrong. - Have you read the morning paper? - No. I haven't gotten to it yet. But, I do know that...
A quaint old maneuver to divert suspicion. As they say in the movies, "They went thataway." You're right. It's an oldie. A very old oldie.
Callahan, that ain't an anchor out of the water. It's a dinghy. How did that dinghy get there? Not very neat of the inspector, was it? What's the excitement, boy?
How did that dinghy get there? Not very neat of the inspector, was it? What's the excitement, boy? It's just a razorblade. Oh, no.
- Is it one of them big bass tuba things? - Yeah, that's it. There it is. Thanks. If it was any bigger, it'd bite you.
How do you do? We met before. At the Charity Ball? Remember, when you dropped your necklace? Yes.
At the Charity Ball? Remember, when you dropped your necklace? Yes. Why aren't you wearing it? You're wearing the earrings.
Love it. Come on. Live a little, Ziggy. Live a little, man. My body needs lifting.
I'm sorry, I don't feel it yet. That ain't it yet. I don't feel it. That's it. Yeah.
- I have half of Poughkeepsie on my face. I like that corner particularly. We'll join you as soon as we finish. - Who gets the bone? - I do.
Of course, I remember the lace perfectly. - Where did you get this? - Eve's Fifth Avenue, I think. - I mean, is it yours? - I only steal cocktail napkins.
Mrs. Amboy's necklace. She isn't wearing it anymore. - I don't like it. - Sorry, but that's the way it's got to be. - She isn't.
She isn't wearing it anymore. - I don't like it. - Sorry, but that's the way it's got to be. - She isn't. - And Mrs. Talbin is wearing it.
-You are Michael, aren't you? -That's right. I'm very interested in murders. Forgive me if I seem inquisitive, but where'd it happen? -At Murcia.
I'm very interested in murders. Forgive me if I seem inquisitive, but where'd it happen? -At Murcia. -How'd you do it? Now, let me guess.
Forgive me if I seem inquisitive, but where'd it happen? -At Murcia. -How'd you do it? Now, let me guess. You did it with your hands, didn't you?
What'd he do to you? Nothing. You just killed him for the fun of it? He was a Franco spy. There was a war on at the time.
-I'm independent. Of money? Before you write that novel, you'd better learn something. You've been travelling the world too much to find out about it. That's good, Arthur.
-Did he say anything about us? -He's afraid the world's going to explode. He talked about suicide. I've thought of that sometimes. Suicide?
Running away doesn't work. I tried it. Everything's bad, Michael. Everything. You can't escape it or fight it.
He isn't dead yet, Grisby's alive. He won't be murdered until tonight. Is that foolish enough for you? My husband wrote that thing and got you to sign it for him. It's one of those famous Bannister tricks.
The other victim was my servant. If I defend Michael, any jury will figure I have reason to believe he's innocent. And you have reason to believe that Michael is innocent? I hear that Galloway is going to say that Michael took George's corpse into the city in our speedboat. -We can prove he didn't.
And you have reason to believe that Michael is innocent? I hear that Galloway is going to say that Michael took George's corpse into the city in our speedboat. -We can prove he didn't. -George couldn't have taken it. -Why not?
-Why not? -How could it get back? -Back where? -To the yacht, naturally. The speedboat couldn't have driven itself.
Well, sir, it so happens that I've kept silent for ten years. It's been ten years since I've made a vow to remain silent and not to show my face to anybody. Tonight I'm showing my face and I'm talking, this is superb! Tell me about your adventure. Take this.
Don't you see that I'm going crazy! Shoot! - Don't tempt me! - In a few seconds it'll be too late... Alright, kill me!
What does the Queen think about it? I think this resemblance has acted more in my favour with Her Majesty that my personal merits. You seem tired. Sit down. Next to me. This resemblance might be useful to us. If we disapproved of it, it might create a scandal.
But when happiness and misfortune are just as terrible, that's magnificent. - My love... - Look at my neck. This morning my medallion seemed to strangle me. Death who imprisons me, shouted to me "So you want to live, girl?
Katya, you have a Russian soul! Why did you have to be born in that Boston? Nature went mad that day, Boris. You have not been around since you sent me this Joan Madou. Why? What is the matter with her?
Yes. Yes, yes, yes! Oh, what's the use? What is it? Why is it that way with us?
You gave me this year. Why didn't I stay with you? It was my fault, Joan. No. It was...
Music here in my own forest? How dare they? How dare they? I don't know, Your Majesty. I want my stag! It must be a band marching down the highway.
Charming little beasts. Look as if they were made of black wool and licorice. If I might be excused, Your Majesty. What is it? What's happening? She's run away.
And now let us proceed to a luncheon we have prepared for you. A very simple luncheon. Powdered egg omelette, probably, and a little Spam. - Can I carry that for you? - No, thank you.
If you look hard, you'll see the houses are empty shells, completely burned out by incendiaries. Life goes on in those ruins, though. That used to be the largest department store in Berlin. It was 12 storeys high. Later on it became headquarters for the storm troopers.
We had to build schools and find teachers and then teach the teachers. We helped them start a free press and institute a parliamentary government. They had their first free election in 14 years. It had been so long they didn't know what to do. It was like handing the village drunk a glass of water.
I'd appreciate it if you'd leave me alone. How's about some reading matter for the plane? Those aren't teardrops. I was washing my hands when he asked me to give it to you. All right, I'll put it right there.
Sergeant, you a judge of whiskey? Well, sir, some people say I am, and some say I'm not, sir. Tell me what you make of this. Well it's better than no whiskey at all, sir. - Strike a match.
I can't believe that. Sergeant Major O'Rourke, you will pardon me for speaking bluntly. But as a noncommissioned officer, you are aware of the barrier between your class and mine. - I am, sir. But Michael's an officer. Not that it makes any difference.
Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die, passing through nature to eternity. Aye, madam, it is common. If it be, why seems it so particular with thee? Seems, madam?
- But where was this? - Upon the platform, where we watched. - Did you not speak to it? - My lord, I did, but answer made it none. Yet once methought it lifted up its head as it would speak.
- And fixed his eyes upon you? - Most constantly. - I would I had been there. - It would have much amazed you. Very like. Very like.
Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, it will keep out water a great while. Here. Here's a skull now. This skull hath lain in the earth three and twenty year. - Whose was it? - A whoreson mad fellow's it was.
I'm grateful. Because she's the one that got me the job? Let's go. Hurry up, Bruno. It's almost 6:30. I can't clean it good because it's still dark. Daddy, did you see what they've done?
Because she's the one that got me the job? Let's go. Hurry up, Bruno. It's almost 6:30. I can't clean it good because it's still dark. Daddy, did you see what they've done? It's dented.
What is it? Lay off! Yesterday I was at the fruit market. Excuse me. This man here stole your bicycle? Yes, and I want it back.
You'll be late for breakfast. - Yeah. - Who did it? Yes? - I did. Haven't I repeatedly told you not to cut up the paper until I've read it? I'm sorry, Father.
It's charming. That is, for an old house. You understand, Mr. Smith, we're just window-shopping. Oh, perfectly all right. Not a bad-looking house.
Bill. Muriel and I have found what I'm not ashamed to call our dream house. It's like a painting. You buy it with your heart, not your head. You don't ask, "How much was the paint? The canvas?" You look at it.
It's like a painting. You buy it with your heart, not your head. You don't ask, "How much was the paint? The canvas?" You look at it. And you say, "It's beautiful. I want it."
Well, I must admit, it's a very beautiful thing. The house and the lilac bush at the corner are just the same age, Bill. If a lilac can live and be so old, so can the house. It just needs someone to love it, that's all. It's good there are two of you.
What'd your engineer say about the foundation and the roof? Who needs engineers? This isn't a train. I just saw it move. It's stood since the second year of the Continental Congress.
I think you'd better get in touch with Mr. Apollonio. The house has charm, hasn't it, Mr. Apollonio? Any small changes would have to conform to the character of the countryside. And still be functional. What is your professional opinion?
A simple bathroom, 8 by 10 by 8 with grade-A fixtures will cost around $ 1300. I refuse to endanger my children's health in a house with less than four bathrooms. For $ 1300, they can live in a house with three bathrooms and rough it. - Why, Bill! - Hello, Muriel.
- How long does that go on? - Three weeks now at $4.50 a foot. - Yeah, right. I think I'd better have a little talk with Mr. Tesander. - Yep? - How's it coming?
- And I consider it very tasty. Gussie, I spend eight hours every day trying to cram this stuff down the throats of millions. I know all about it. Its succulent goodness. - Its sugar-smoked tenderness.
Now, the kitchen's to be white. - Not a cold, antiseptic, hospital white. - No. A little warmer, but still, not to suggest any other color but white. Now, for the powder room in here, I want you to match this thread. And don't lose it.
- Not a cold, antiseptic, hospital white. - No. A little warmer, but still, not to suggest any other color but white. Now, for the powder room in here, I want you to match this thread. And don't lose it. It's the only spool I have and I had an awful time finding it.
What do you want? Mr. Blandings, there's a matter of $ 12.36. Twelve dollars and thirty-six cents. Why be a piker, Mr. Tesander? Here, take everything I've got.
Is it wound? Is it oiled? Is it true? - You're not gonna use it? - Certainly. Take it on, Gumbo.
Is it oiled? Is it true? - You're not gonna use it? - Certainly. Take it on, Gumbo. Oh, it's like a graveyard out there.
He's diabolically clever. He's trying to trick you, make a fool of you. Excellency, I await your permission. No. No.
- She's mine. I see a "D" for Dunson, but my name's Matthew. - We'll talk about that later. - I don't see any "M" on that brand. I'll put an "M" on it when you earn it. That's fair enough.
Pretty unhealthy job. Get away, Matt. I'm sorry for you-- How about you? You want some of it?
See, he thought I was one of a bunch-- Hold it. Right there. It's all right, Buster. It's me, Matt.
What was that? - Did you hear something? - I didn't hear nothing. I heard it. It was nothing I ever heard before. Hey, they're yelling down on the point.
We did do it in daytime. Alright now, Phillip? - Yes. - Good. You better put those away in my chequebook drawer behind the box. Now...
You better put those away in my chequebook drawer behind the box. Now... It's a museum piece now. We really should preserve it for posterity, except, it's such good crystal and I'd hate to break up the set. Out of this, David Kentley had his last drink.
- It's not locked. All the better. It's more dangerous. And the lock's too old. It won't work. I wish it would. I wish we had him out of here. I wish it were somebody else.
- The rope, of course. Brandon, we've got to hide it. - Why? - Why? Yes, why?
Answer it. Brandon... Brandon, couldn't we pretend we're not home? With all these lights on? Answer it, Phillip. Who is it?
- Save it for Chickamaw. Mattie got us a house in Gusherton all right. Had to take it for six months. - Gonna leave the car here? - Sure, it's okay. Some shack, eh?
You ain't aiming to get a hitch? That's no way to start a honeymoon. You got any ideas? Well, thought maybe I could fix you up with a car. Maybe. Party I know took in a new convertible today. How long will it take?
Uh, mind the second step. Not fancy, but it's comfortable. We got a lot of blankets. It gets kind of chilly up here. It freezes, but it never snows.
I guess Alvin won't get his sweater for Christmas. I left it on the radio. He'll find it. Bowie... I'm gonna have our baby.
Oh, there's no hurry. My seconds haven't arrived yet. With all respect, sir, would it be proper if we didn't wait? You see, I have a similar appointment in an hour. That is, if I survive this one. No, just as you say.
- What is it? What's the matter, Athos? I don't understand you. That's a very beautiful ring. Yes.
- Listen. - The rest is bargaining. My terms are simple. First, there is a certain estate in the vicinity of Lille, a barony. It was renounced by its owner quite some years ago.
Your kidnappers, in a few minutes would report to Richelieu either your corpse or your disappearance. And, you, my dear wife fainting is neither becoming nor believable. Richelieu gave you a certain paper, a carte blanche. Since I cannot kill you, I must at least have that paper. No.
- Hello, there. - Hello, yourself. Okay, you guys, get aboard. Take it your way. What's the matter with you two?
Do you believe what the old man... who was doing all the talking at the Oso Negro... said the other night... about gold changing a man's soul so that he ain't the same kind of a guy... that he was before finding it? Guess that all depends on the man. That's exactly what I say. Gold don't carry any curse with it. It all depends on whether or not the guy who finds it is the right guy.
Look here. Look, it's all around. What else could it be? Only gold shines and glitters like that. We've struck it, Curt.
- Not much different from sand. - Yeah. It's just like plain sand. It don't glitter. I thought it would. It will when it's refined by some other guy.
- Tank full yet? - Right to the top. Open the sluice gate. How much do you figure it to be now? About $5,000 worth, I reckon.
There's something more important. What is it? Brace yourself. I'm gonna kick you in the teeth. You won't like it right at first.
I guess it's from missing the old Army beans. Here, I figured that maybe you could use some eating supplies yourself. - Gold! Well, where'd you get it? - Off our claim.
No, thanks. But that was long after. Do not write that much. You are very good. married up. -With the French?
Good day, young sirs. I have come to welcome you. We'd be very grateful if you'd tell us what all this means. It means that the prophecy of the two birds... of the fairest color has been fulfilled. It is a very old one.
I had landed myself in the driveway of some big mansion that looked run-down and deserted. At the end of the drive was a lovely sight indeed, a great big empty garage, just standing there, going to waste. If ever there was a place to stash away a limping car with a hot license number. There was another occupant in that garage, an enormous, foreign-built automobile. It must have burned up ten gallons to a mile.
Well, now. I think maybe you are a musician. Yes, sir. And that kid out there he had a perfect ear for it. He could hear it, and he could feel it.
And for whom? For the people. For that foul-smelling rabble. It's so hot today. This heat of Rome oppresses me.
- l can't imagine a more glorious death. - l'm warning you, Andre. I know. But if I took any notice, how insulting it would be. If I hadn't come back, I doubt you would have lasted the year out. Think of this, a sword is like a bird.
- Do you still want to make that bet? - Name it. Remember, I'm not in the same league with you, financially. Take my car. If I'm wrong, it's yours.
Maud? Just a second, darling! Your cocoa is nearly ready. Ten o'clock! Oh, darling, this is a surprise! I made it myself from a new recipe.
- Same thing last night, sir. - On the move all along the front. - Yes. I think you'll find pressure all around our defences. However, it seems to me that this hill, Ed Duda, is a key position.
Waking and sleeping, you were with me. And even more, since it happened. - Since what happened? - Every evening of the voyage, a star appeared above the bow, standing bright and steady in the sky, as if sent to guide the ship home. In my illness, I thought you had sent it as a sign.
And we have to save the professor in spite of himself. You once said you had a plan. Well, have you? - Yeah, I got a plan. - Well?
- Cheers, Robert. Afterwards, they wandered through the old streets. It was a stroll through a thousand memories. The post box is still there. - It'll outlive us.
The rehearsals are agonizing. also for me. - What do you mean? At times I think this music is a monstrosity. My friend BüIow believes it could send a person mad.
There mustn't be a mistake this time. - I'll be back in a couple of hours. - All right, Steve. Science is science, but a girl must get her hair done. You'd better hurry though, if you're going to catch that bus.
- Your Majesty. My lords. - We are honoured, monsieur. May I compliment you once again on this most beautiful palace? There is no other like it in all of Europe.
Joseph, it's true. It does bring out the colour in your beautiful, big, brown eyes. Oh, to be a painter! What a beautiful turkey. Where'd you get it?
Should Bunny Watson marry Mike Cutler? Question mark. Oh, wait a minute. I thought you said this machine can't evaluate. Can't. Can't.
The great American woman, who stands out there naked, waiting for me to tell her what to wear. It doesn't speak. And if it won't speak to me, it won't speak to anyone. A magazine must be like a human being. If it comes into the home it must contribute.
Now, listen carefully. You are in the Museum of Modern Art, Marion. Deep, Marion. Profound, Marion. You have come across this statue.
- And what message will you convey? Seven times in the past 29 years, without our once suspecting it the computer has suggested certain changes in its own design which we blindly carried out. Each one having to do with its feedback system. The thing's forebrain. Now it's achieved true thought. True personality.
Now it's achieved true thought. True personality. It lives. Life, consciousness, a machine? An intellect enormously more powerful and efficient even than yours, professor.
Ariane! Is my lunch ready? How about lunch? No, thank you, Papa. Ariane, is this yours? - Yes, Papa.
Get down to the mill! Come on! Take cover! Here. There's a mine shaft at the end of these cables.
We're not gonna get out of this. Maybe you're not, but I am. I'll guarantee you of that. See that cockroach? Tomorrow morning, we'll be dead and it'll be alive.
So you going? Grisha! Once before we went like this to Yagodnoye. Only our bundle was bigger and we were younger. Why do you carry your rifle?
That's right. A customary weapon. It will last a lifetime. It's bit bulky though. It's more suitable for a glove compartment. In any case, it's pretty impressive.
I can't open up. I'm John Courtney, and I'm locked in my own office. Well, how'd you come to lock yourself in? I was working last night and I jammed the key in the lock and then I turned it and broke it off. You can find it down there under the lock, I think, on the floor.
Mother-in-law will just marry earlier. That will solve all the problems. - You don't have to go that far. - I exaggerate, and you know it. But Anne's way of living is better than ours, and I have to face it. Good, then face it.
City recorder, close the books of Yang Cheng with this entry. As a sign of respect for the honored foot inspector of this city, the Hsien Chang of Yang Cheng has become a Christian. I thank you for this... For this great gift. I can't... I can't... Jen-ai, accept my gift.
- Now, there you are. - Thank you. I'm just about ready. All I've gotta do is find my lipstick. Where did I put it?
In Lt. Manion's case, a soldier it is only natural that he would turn to action. Only direct, simple action against Barney Quill would relieve this unbearable tension. This is not uncommon. For example, in combat, some of the more remarkable heroics take place in this state of mind. Is there another name for this state we might be more likely to recognise?
That room at the end of the corridor upstairs: Has it been used lately? - Not for some time, sir. - I see. I think you'll find a candle burning near the window in that room. Do kindly extinguish it.
- I'm glad the warning apparatus works. - Of course. - Come on, Papa, please! - For how long? It could be some time. Then I have to remove the detonator.
The Tingler. You like it? The Tingler? Why not? Since we don't know what it is yet, we can't give it a Latin name. Tingler.
I know exactly how it was. What are you going to do? First, I'm going to put The Tingler back where it came from. So that if it can die, it will. And then I'll call the police.
-I can't get the car started. -No? I think it's the ignition. Must've gone out when I went through that fence. How sad.
And love is the morning and the evening star. Love, the eternal glorious musicmaker. Love! Not the carnal love, but the divine love. And where does this great love come from?
I'll not fight like a gladiator! You keep staring at this. Do you recognize this baton? - Yes! - You should!
You will return now to your chambers. The crown......is it ready ? Your beneficence. This ? .... This gross piece to be worn on the altar of Chemosh? It's heavy and dead.
The crown......is it ready ? Your beneficence. This ? .... This gross piece to be worn on the altar of Chemosh? It's heavy and dead. It lacks luster.
His face is a blur. Now, nothing! The cloud again. The dark cloud. It covers everything.
Now, nothing! The cloud again. The dark cloud. It covers everything. It's stronger than I am.

(male narrator) THERE IS A FIFTH DIMENSION BEYOND THAT WHICHIS KNOWN TO MAN. IT IS A DIMENSION AS VAST AS SPACE AND AS TIMELESS AS INFINITY. IT IS THE MIDDLE GROUND BETWEEN LIGHT AND SHADOW. BETWEEN SCIENCE AND SUPERSTITION.
OH, NO THANK YOU. I WAS JUST NOTICING IT ISN'T VERY MUCH BUT, BUT THAT BAG-- WHAT ABOUT IT? WELL, IT'S J UST LIKE M IN E.

There is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man. It is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity.
A few seconds more, as if you still hesitated to part with him, with yourself, as if his silhouette, now gray, might still reappear, here where you had imagined him too insistently, too fearfully, or too hopefully, for fear of losing this bond - No, that hope is now fruitless. Gone is the fear of losing that bond, that confinement, that falsehood. That entire story is now over.
- A darned violent fear. - The thunderstorms in Switzerland... - Did you like it there otherwise? I was homesick. But I wasn't coming home until I'd finished the novel.
You're traveling through another dimension- a dimension not only of sight and sound, but of mind, a journey into a wondrous land whose boundaries are that of imagination. Your next stop, the twilight zone. This road is the afterwards of the civil war. It began at fort sumter, south carolina, and ended at a place called appomattox.
- Yes? I'd like to do something to help your paper. I was given a pearl necklace. You could pawn it. Thank you.
This is obviously no place for a sword duel. It's a bit far, but I must ask you to accompany me to Gojiin-gawara. As miserable a hovel as this is, your landlord will be inconvenienced if you do not return. And without someone to retrieve your remains, your soul will wander aimlessly. I suggest you leave a note.
See, I'm due back by five and... - A jeep like this might come in handy. - It sure would. We have this major who makes us stand reveille every morning, rain or shine, which gives you an idea... If we kept it on the move, it'd sound like a lot of jeeps.
Venice was so good to award me an honorary research project: Reconstruction of political murders from the 14th century. The misdeeds of our elders keep us fed today. I sit there all night, betraying the Republic of Venice. You see, I am writing a novel instead of doing historical research.
It wasn't that she was just pretty. She was different. She was so alive. I was cleaning the cage. The bird got out. But where is it now?
Why you? God chose a simple girl as intermediary. Where did the angel fiind the crown? I trust God. I don't know where. Did the crown smell good?
Glauert in Lunteren was shot with this gun. We have scientific proof. Is this your gun? - Yes. I thought so.
But what is to fear? That he will destroy the republic? Yes, he will. I promise you he will. Your tongue is old but sharp, Cicero.
By that honor and by the responsibility you carry Brutus, save Rome from Caesar! You cannot ask me to destroy him. Then let Caesar destroy Rome. Antony has just come from a meeting of my friends with good news. Tomorrow at the Senate, Lucius Cotta will move that I be made king.
Antony has just come from a meeting of my friends with good news. Tomorrow at the Senate, Lucius Cotta will move that I be made king. It will pass. But I don't understand. King and emperor.
And so once more, the Romans warred upon each other. And just as Antony had foretold the forces of Octavian came to meet them on the spot where they landed. Which was at Actium, in Greece. Action begins with the rise of the sun. Your plan is brave and simple.
Sure, more like that. "Worries over. Be happy." My letter? Throw it away.
I've waited such a long time. Is this what I came so far to find? Don't let me go! Theo, stay with me! You won't believe this, but five minutes ago I left this door open... so you could find your way.
The birds won't come near this island? Sakuda! Over there! This island is a ship's graveyard. Maybe it's the current.
P.S., I forgot to tell you. Monsieur. Pardon. They told me you had a letter. It's from him?
I have to tell you something. You can tell us later. Upstairs? What's with the door? It won't open.
Upstairs? What's with the door? It won't open. - Is it locked? - It can't be.
Yes, sir. Do our Vindicator missiles have both infrared- and radar-seeking capacity? Yes, sir. Loud and clear! They've got to know we're on the level!
- Delta 9? - What's that? An invisible nerve gas which disperses 1 5 minutes after inducing complete unconsciousness for 24 hours. Tomorrow at dawn, the flying circus of my personal pilot, Miss Pussy Galore, will spray it into the atmosphere. Once the population, including the military, has been immobilized, my task force, which Mr. Strap had his people smuggle across the Rio Grande from Mexico, will approach Fort Knox in motorized equipment along Bullion Boulevard which runs past the depository here, and intersects with Gold Vault Road. This fence surrounding the depository, as Mr. Strap reminded us, is electrified.
I wore the mask to scare you away from him. Now I'm being punished for it! The mask won't come off! Why won't it come off? Why won't it come off?
Relics of a by-gone age. Yes, sir. A glorious age. Gracious, leisurely, orderly. A time for many things. A machine was a thing ofjoy then, built to last a man's lifetime.
We'll never know. That's enough, Martin. We have to start from scratch. The only information we have concerns the organization's structure. Let's start from there.
Emma. I told you we're starting the marriage right now. I'm staying here. No. You're going. I have to send you off to your flea- bitten war.
Call it a power or a force that we are going to release. Perhaps it's in yourself - something in you. What does that matter? You could touch an H bomb and say, "l know what's in there, uranium and stuff... that is all."
Mr Fennan, we know it's idiotic, but when the Foreign Secretary finds that sort of letter in his in-tray, it's like London airport getting an anonymous phone call to say that there's a bomb on the Prime Minister's plane, and somebody's got to do a check. - Was the letter anonymous? - Yes.
It's unfortunate that in this distressing matter we are now answerable to the two public bodies with whom our current relations are most, shall I say, uneasy. Lf, of course, there are facts not included in your confidential report which point to Fennan's suicide for reasons other than his interview with you, I shall be happy to hear about them. Are there? - Have they opened his suicide letter? - They're photostatting the original.
My crew is sworn to secrecy. But my reputation. I mean, just having met like this. Of course, it would be different if you cared for me. Do you want me to manufacture a lie?
Listen, I think that our profession, the art of cinema, doesn't just belong to this century. I think it's an art for young people. You think it's more of a young person's art. I think so too. Let me tell you something. I have been thinking a lot... I've written a film that I never made.
A very good. At the first opportunity buy two or three branded whiskey bottles. It's just a small investment. What am I going to multiply. The Spider was here. I told you I was here. And I know how to cross the River.
- Yes? You just want me to have this flower? - Don't know who I am? - It doesn't matter. What matters is the flower.
Let's do it! All right. After destroying lnawashiro Dam, Guilala is now heading for the Pacific coast. Commander, it's from FAFC. What?
Commander, it's from FAFC. What? It destroyed the Atomic Research Center and power plant? It absorbed all the atomic energy and is stronger than ever? It's turned into a ball of energy, bouncing from place to place.
It's out there waiting for you. We'll need your help to get away. You've got it. You think this Companion can do anything. I said it was very powerful.
Something in the sun killed that thing, before the Denevan died. All right. You've tried heat... radiation... What other qualities or properties does the sun have? It exists physically.
All right. You've tried heat... radiation... What other qualities or properties does the sun have? It exists physically. It occupies space.
You've tried heat... radiation... What other qualities or properties does the sun have? It exists physically. It occupies space. It has mass, therefore gravity.
- What do you believe now? - That the crystals aren't on your ship. - Mr Spock? - Unable to locate the radiation. Why not? You spotted it from the Enterprise.
A changeling was a fairy child that was left in place of a human baby. The changeling assumed the identity of the human child. So it is to sterilise. And for "sterilise" read "kill". And it has the power and the sophistication to do it.

I could go to my old teacher Makino... he's the only honest man i know. Would he be able to help me in my doubt? I envy you. You have a marvellous garden, Makino. I'm glad you like it, my Lord.
I say tell him off. Hogan, maybe you're right. After all, what have you got to lose? You can always fall back on the firing squad. Klink, I have just come from that mine.
I was acquainting you with the fact of a murder that my brother, Lord Henry Beverton, and Doctor Adams planned to commit. But what I can I do? Sir John isn't here. - In any case you've got to do something! The hypo that I gave him should last for about one hour.
Four-and-a-half-inch reel... 16 millimeter... in an insulated aluminum capsule. And all of a sudden, you know a whole damn lot about my business. We don't believe in going on a mission totally blindfolded, Mr. Jones. The film came out of a camera... - mounted in a Russian satellite.
I pick up an object. This pen is red... But it writes black. Deceiving appearances... It's a very common pencil.

It occurred to me that nowhere in the rules does it state a tournament player may not take advantage of any aid he can. Oh, then you're interested? I would like to see the computer in action once more, please. I don't see why not. Turn it on.
Are you prepared to do business? - Go. - Webster killed George Corley for a piece of jewellery worth $10 million. What, this crown thing? This crown thing was worn by the Empress Theodora in the fifth century.

Now, that's what I call a dead parrot. No, no. It's stunned. Look, my lad, I've had just about enough of this. That parrot is definitely deceased. And when I bought it not half an hour ago you assured me that its lack of movement was due to it being tired and shagged out after a long squawk.
It's over. It's over. Corporal Clemens, sir, from Masters' Brigade at Dante's Crossroads. Who gave you permission to come ridin' across the face of my command yelling' like a fool? Have you got a message for me from General Masters? Yes, sir.
The supply ship that she was waiting for never came. All these thousands of years she's been waiting to greet people who were dead. To do the job of defence, the computer projected a replica of the only image available: Losira's. The computer was too perfect.
That's very clever. But I didn't say it. I said the body of James Kirk is being used by Dr. Janice Lester. A subtlety that somehow escapes me. I assume that this switch was arrived at by mutual agreement. No.

Please. Please wait. Please. As it was addressed to you, sir, I thought you might like to have it. I opened it because I thought it might throw some light on all this.

Will you take me with you? Maybe. Tell me, do you know someone called Rosemochronos...? - Is that your red hat? - Yes, it's mine. It's one of the red queen's hats.

We have developed a cheese sandwich that can withstand An impact of up to 4,000 pounds per square inch? Good heavens! Amazing, isn't it?

Mush in a mess of wind. I said, come on. Your brother left some things in the bunkhouse. You want them? Where does your pebble walk to, grasshopper?

Lucita and I have broken all the rules. I have found refuge in a place where the presence of a man is a sacrilege. You should hate me rather than protect me. You should denounce me to the Inquisition. Your story touched me.
Can you hold a pen? —I'll try. Yes, jolly good. You know, it's a hell of a nuisance, all this damn paperwork. Really, it is. It's a real nightmare, this paperwork.

When we break free, we will be thrown approximately 5.698 light-years. Compensation factors laid in, sir. But how are you going to break free? The force globe is flexible in only one direction per unit of time. We shall both push and pull on it simultaneously.
Down there... Go down there. It's empty. The church is empty. It rules no more it condemns no longer it means nothing anymore.

Through cornea it wings To a heavenly spring, To ice-laden slings, To a chariot birds bring.

Was the contraption connected to the goods train wheel? Yes. It was attached to the rear wheel frame of the locomotive. Then we can't remove it from the inside. Why not?
I resent the order as much as you do. But this is a time when you must choose the lesser evil. But... We found it! We found the bomb!
-Know what's in this case? Look! Like it, don't you? Bastard! Yes, you like it.

We have no reason to believe that any aggression has been taken against our homes and families. I believe that what we have stumbled across is not man-made but a phenomena of nature. One that can't be explained. Now, this phenomena is a storm which the Nimitz went through less than 18 hours ago. This storm has had some effect on time as we know it.
My comrade, marching at my side Advanced in step with me Advanced in step with me A bullet came flying free Meant for you or meant for me?

It's been a long time. Can you explain the removal of your user account on June 23rd, 1973? They must have told it he died. People sometimes make... mistakes. - Yes, they do.
-We've counterfeited the passes. -All right. Say you do get inside, you have no chance against his troops. We'll handle them. This scheme is so reckless. It's ill-conceived.
My client is very impatient. If I don't fulfill my mission, I'll be killed. That's why I need the formula. But where? Where do I have it?
And Louis himself McCarthy is drivin'. Then somebody else was drivin' that boat on the way out. Hey, Castillo, this is Tubbs. Yeah? [ Tubbs ] They've got it!
Hasty departure, huh? - From this world, I suspect. What, you think Walter was murdered here? Mrs. Lindner, how long has that oil stain been on your driveway? Well, the gardeners were here yesterday morning. They would have cleaned it up.
Strike two! That looked good, St. James. Come on. Laura, I don't know what you're up to, but I've worked very hard to improve my swing... and I've no intention of going down to ignominious defeat with the bat on my shoulder. Take a look at the top of your bat, DiMaggio, and don't make it look obvious.
I could have been Buzz Blade forever. Except for that accident. Mr. Sinclair, I'm no expert on this sort of thing but I really think that you could use some help. The film was virtually complete the day of the explosion. They were able to release it.
Yeah. Poor Fred. What about you, Amanda? When did you actually find out about the bomb? Oh. [CHUCKLES]
I have no one else to turn to. -What is it? -It's unbelievable. The Direktor has actually torn up a huge section of my music. They say I have to rewrite the opera.
Tell him. You're his father. Come on, son. Leave the bird alone. Then the bird's feather.
This is not a recording. Hey, thanks for the hose job! If I tell you boys something, you won't think I've been drinking, will ya? The white Lamborghini is vanished, but there's a red one behind me honking its horn. Correction!
Arrakis, Dune, Desert Planet. Your time has come. A storm is coming. Our storm.
Mr. Johnson? Mr. Johnson? I'll be going in your house soon to get your baby. What modifications were made to the robot? I didn't make any modifications. I didn't touch that thing.

MGM, 1964. But that doesn't explain- Where have you been for the last 36 hours? At the Rexford Palms Hotel, apparently, flat on my back. Laura, all I remember is that after my Wednesday afternoon appointment... with B.J. Sinclair, it was suddenly Friday morning. Does the Colony Park Club ring any bells?
You needn't have bothered. Once they alerted me and I saw whose office was above the safe... I knew who pulled that job. I'm going to enjoy rubbing your nose in this someday, Keyes. Yeah, don't hold your breath, glamour boy. This nose of mine has a sense of its own... when it comes to knowing who's a crook and who isn't.
Thank you very much. Very kind of you. [SIGHS] - What is it? - I made a mess of everything but it wasn't my fault. I didn't see the skateboard.

I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They said you have a form I need to fill out. -Have you got an arrest receipt? -Yeah.
Of course, you are. What's the name of the piece at the back of the knee? - Hasn't got a name. - Oh, then I won't miss it. Lots of other common features haven't got names like this small piece of gristle that separates the nostrils.
The testicles were boiled in soy sauce and the vagina has just a blood sauce. I suspect that it was dismembered during a menstruation. It looks like they had some trouble with this ingredient. They have used a liver with cancer and stewed it with curry sauce. This liver wouldn't have lasted 3 weeks due to the severe cancer.
And then destroyed the evidence, because he was gonna turn it over to the I.R.S. Can't you people make up your minds? First you're accusing Ted, and now you're accusing me. Do you own a gun, Mrs. Goldblume? For protection?
- I'd better notify State. DOUGLAS: What's missing is the proximity bomb. It's our doomsday option. We can snuggle the HK-86 up close to the target, and then poof. How do you track it?
Clever, huh? Ha, ha. Yes, very clever, Mr. Simpson, very clever. Now, what is the back door? Well, the last wall we built, couldn't fortify it so we had to be real careful about hiding it.
Set the V-gain to filter RF ambient. Hudson, tracker online. Left and right, little buddy. 40 meters in, bearing 221, there should be a stairwell. Check.

300 quid that suit cost me. You've torn it. Monk. Monk? You've torn the sleeve off a 300-guinea suit. Oh no, not the car! It's not mine. It's a customer's.
The teleporter insists on purity. I was not pure. I don't know what you mean. A fly got into the transmitter pod with me that first time when I was alone. The computer got confused. There weren't supposed to be two genetic patterns. And it decided to splice us together.
What if, one year, it doesn't rain? No, we need a field near a natural water source. I wonder... What if we bought *Pique-Bouffigue's field and spring, up there at Romarins? Is the spring still flowing? I heard my father say it was dead.
My Lords. My Lords, this is a list of our commands. We wish first for you to call a Parliament to repeal the laws relating to the branding of unfortunates forced into beggary.

And third, we wish a school to be endowed.

I got your wallet. You got my wallet? It fell out of your jacket and I picked it up. - Why didn't you tell me? - I'm telling you now.
I find it illogical that its intentions be hostile. You think this is its way of saying, "Hi, there!" to Earth? Only human arrogance would assume the message must be meant for man. You're suggesting the transmission is meant for a life form other than man? It is a possibility.
The guys with dark glasses kidnapped you? That guy was one of them? Who can they be, calling in the army? Dola and the other guys, they all want the stone. But I had no idea it had mysterious powers.

Before. After. You and your lovely wife might've been asking yourself, "exactly what are the benefits of aluminum siding." It won't chip, peel, blister, crack, flake, or rust in any way. Only maintenance you'll ever have is to wash it down twice a year with a hose.
Then I could see only shadows. Then I could see only shadows. So I left the country, blind. Only your mother knows my story. Now that you have come to me, I entrust the Korê wing to you.

What's that on your finger? No! Not on your ring finger. It fits! Yes.
I'm scared, Paul. I just can't wait to talk to that cemetery custodian. What do you hope to learn? I don't know. I just can't get that doll out of my mind. I saw it.
Yes, of course. Though, I really don't see what possible-- Someone has been here. Excuse me. This bottle of digitalis, was it empty?
Something to do with roses? Roses, greenfly, spray, syringe! Syringe? While I was walking back down... I saw this little box. I picked it up, and inside was one of those hypodermic things.

See, Superman saved me from this building the sound guy blew up and even though I'm not a reporter I thought I'd write down a few paragraphs, show the chief but I can finish it someplace else. Yeah. Let me get out of your way. Okay? Yeah. Hey, you're wearing the receiver for my spy pen.
Honey, it's in the catalogue that she sent me. What catalogue, Peg? It's called X.X.L.L. Bean. And I put it with the mail. Where is the mail, Gracie?
Okay, you're in trouble now, buddy. I voted for him. And they say you can't fight city hall. - Where'd you get that apple? - Oh, it was in my yard.
Well, what about the commercial? - There's not gonna be a commercial. - Why? I've got a zit. Look at it, Daddy.
[bleeping] That's why I'm calling you. That'll take us 10 hours to get there. Why don't you send some jet copters? The capsule sank on impact. We don't know exactly where or how deep... but we have reason to believe that some of them are still alive. [beeping] A signal buoy... popped to the surface 10 minutes ago.
How the hell do you know that? Studied up for my Officer Review. Hey, buddy. I'm through! UEO central computer recognized our inquiry.
We'll talk later. If we're still alive. Status? It looks like the Marauder is reversing course, as though it were hunting us. In my program, as I remember it, they should be launching a missile about 1800 hours.
If we're still alive. Status? It looks like the Marauder is reversing course, as though it were hunting us. In my program, as I remember it, they should be launching a missile about 1800 hours. It's afraid we'll find it before then.
I've never seen anybody risk that before. I have. I used that in the Aegean campaign. I forgot it, but it remembered. And now?
And it would take days. We'd have to evacuate the station. The only other thing I can come up with is a directional sonic generator. I can adjust it to a frequency uncomfortable to them, drive them out. But that's too slow.
- Sorry. It's a two-man game. Get your hand off that. Is that why you killed the engineer? To get this brick? I had to get it back.
Because the end result was unknown. The object could have been dangerous. It may in fact be dangerous. And I have allowed it to go off on its merry way. Yes, sir. The intelligence that was formed didn't just come out of the ship's systems.
The man there says he has Molor's head in a box. The real Molor. That is impossible. The real Molor died centuries ago. I know.
I took care of your grandmother's house. Nana never mentioned you. There's lots she didnae talk about. Let me get rid of that candle. Why?
It could beat beavering as a way to get rich. What's gonna draw people? Your good looks or my sunny disposition? Darling Janey, This bitter cold is something. I had to put the ink in the coffee pot to thaw it.
Throw it! I dare you! Ouda, don't just stand there. Throw me a spear! It's in the bone!
Why Rosanna? - She had such a beautiful nature. - I can't take it anymore. - Really? The fear's too much for a duck.
It's abandoned. No one comes here any more. The guy who had this place, he gave up a long time ago. Look. You see this earth?
Excuse me, sir. I've got news from the US G Control Center. It doesn't look too good. They have the latest readouts from the satellites. It seems Godzilla's temperature is rising.
Steven. You like that name? Yeah, I think it suits you. It's okay? I won't let anything happen to you. This force, this thing ... that lived inside of him ... came from a source ... too violent ... too deadly for you to imagine.
I'd Iike to know. Why? Don't ask. That's how it is. Sir, I fear the road leads nowhere.
You"d fight for any son of a bitch if he convinced you you were right. - Someone convinced you. - Not someone, something. The Alliance was formed to support you. You"re right, Jefferson.
Mademoiselle Sally, you are on the terms amicable with the other students? Some of them. I've just had a vacation with Len Bateson. A week in Amsterdam. This was before the rucksack was stolen?
-What? Nothing! -I saw my name. What is it? -No, no, see? See?
What notes? l-l-l was going to give them to you tomorrow. You have to lean out of a castle to kiss the Blarney stone? Weren't you scared? Hey, after raising five boys by myself, nothing scares me. Well, why do you kiss the Blarney stone, anyway?
You wanna get crazy, huh? Come on. What the...? The power. He cannot control it.
That's where they store the virus. So how do we get to it? There's an air vent that leads directly to the chamber. Exactly what makes this virus so special? It's airborne.
Sonya's gonna kill me. - What is this place? - A Sanctuary District. 21 st century history is not one of my strong points. Too depressing.
- We'll have to wait till the probe exits. - That shouldn't take long. Captain, I'm getting a distorted energy reading. The probe's telemetry has changed. It's stuck.
Someone is interested in that probe. There may be a entity within the wormhole, curious about an intruder. Our probe would have detected that. - What's the condition of the probe? - I've been monitoring it.
They can hear his bloody leg dragging on the floor. The mutant is on their trail, hungry for the taste of young meat. - What's it look like? - Yeah, what? Do you really wanna know?
You asked for them during your worst fevers. During my fever, I... I left here and travelled to a place. This place. You carry it with you.
I need a moment's rest. Sorry. I splashed you. I spoke to your mother about the veil. She told me. Get used to wearing it, my child.
You run an arms smuggling ring. You got my bad side. Three days ago you pulled a job at the Army Research Facility. You stole the X-5 unit. You had it with you when you checked in.
I can't see a damn thing! - Die! - Jesus! I think I nailed it. I don't believe it!
Park ranger. Just put it down and I won't have to kill you. This isn't a standoff. I've got the gun. I never keep it loaded.
- We can barely hold on as it is. - You're right, it's not working. That's why we've got to try something else. Not bury the technology, but let it out. You let it out, but you let it out at a pace the world can absorb.
And I'll keep you that way. Your hand. There's a first-aid kit under your seat. That weapon, or whatever it was was from your company, wasn't it? It's an E.M. prototype.
- Absolutely. She looks for me at the library. A so-called friend tells her where I am. Next thing I know, here she comes across the track where tryouts are with this big, thick leather belt. It was so thick no one could wear it.
There are some on your neck as well. They look almost like teeth marks. That's-- Yes, sir. That's what they are. Mary, you'll find an eel in the fish pantry. Fetch it in, will you?
-I can't wait. It's simple. No one knows who fed you this information. And I mean nobody. How did you get it?
Peculiar air. Sometimes it seems like poison gas, but then you find you can't breathe in any other. That is not at all the case with francoise. I don't like cats, but when my dog died, he gave me a cat. I still have it.
It's the famous Krupp 88. It's almost a shame that there are no planes to fire them at. Fire. A tank is deaf and half-blind. You can hear it, but it can't hear you. It's hard for you to see it all because of the way it jolts up and down.
Doesn't it look like someone's face? A face? This rock is limestone. It's smooth and pretty, just like a movie star. This one is quartz.
I'm looking for a weapon that can be smuggled in, concealed easily and used to strike at our enemies, learn their secrets, perhaps even... - ...destroy them from the inside. - Whatever. One warning: This stuff is made primarily for humans.
"The problems of others are not our concern." I do not blame you for standing silent in your shame. You, who knew what was coming, but refused to take up the burden of this war. If the warrior caste will not fight, then the rest of us will. The Council has lost its way.
It's an unhealthy mistake. - What have you done? - What have I done? I've done nothing. I've given them the island of Celini.
I come here to think, to dream, to plan for my eventual godhood and to play. Very few who come in here ever leave again. You should feel honored. The electro-whip is set to give an increasing level of pain each time it is used. At 40 strokes, it will kill even a Narn.
It failed. But in the year of the Shadow War, it became something greater our last, best hope for victory. The year is 2260. The place, Babylon 5. I have checked the data records of the great machine running the planet below.
Okay. You know what? I think you're very funny. Kudos on that hat joke. Ha, ha. But come on, guys, just give him back the hat. Why should we?
Well, Sammy, where would you like to begin? With the obvious, Al. The front door. I'll step outside. You lock it up.
"Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, which..." Now, stop right there, Juliet. Can you tell me the significance of that line? That I actually remembered it. All right!
Don't panic. Don't panic. Yes, don't panic. Has the bullet I supposedly fired turned up? No.
But what would you know about that? - He's radioactive. - What? Jimmy. I gave him my card.
To the point. If Superman wasn't able to save the space station the main thrusters were programmed to stop and the altitude thrusters would've fired anyway. The space station would've saved itself. So you mean there was never any real danger? - Exactly.
I wanna stay. Is that the bomb? It's not here. "If you're reading this, I assume you got my message. Here's the location of the real bomb.
I wanna see if there's any clues they might've overlooked. You got it. I'll never get used to that. The bomb almost exploded. Correction.
It sent a plasma burst along the tachyon beam into our main power system. We've got EPS relays burned out all over the ship. I'm not getting any response from the warp or impulse drives. Even the maneuvering thrusters are out! The missile was not significantly damaged.
Med Lab to Lieutenant Tuvok. Go ahead, Doctor. I think I've found something that will help you. Do you see the DNA strands on the lower border? Yes. They were retrieved from inside the head wound by nanites that I designed to recognize unusual DNA patterns. This DNA was isolated because it didn't belong to the victim.
You can't yell. Understand? If you stopped thinking, so much about poetry... you'd make your father happier and you'd make more money than him. That's right, Oreste. That's what I tell him too. What a nice hat. How does it look? - Nice.
That's right, Oreste. That's what I tell him too. What a nice hat. How does it look? - Nice. How does it look?
Oh, right, rub my nose in it, why don't you? $10 million design, and now those militia nutjobs get to keep their cash. So fucking unfair. That bomb you built does deserve an audience. It's a work of art.
A bit more! More, I said! Look. What a big bell! Look at the size of it!
I don't know. I don't know either. Here. Take my own mezuza in that tree of yours up there. Keep it with you at all times.
Hey, how you doing, creep? Good. Me too, except my arm has been bothering me. Oh, no, Dad! Oh, yeah.
There's a job for you in San Diego, if you want it. I've spent enough time in the company of death. Fifteen years ago, John Hammond had a dream. Like John himself, the dream was grand. It was outsized. It was bold.
I've spent enough time in the company of death. Fifteen years ago, John Hammond had a dream. Like John himself, the dream was grand. It was outsized. It was bold. It was impractical.
- Ashitaka. - Kaya, you can't be here. I don't care. Remember me with this. Your jewel dagger.
There are so many beautiful and remarkable things here. Yes. When I was a child, I would come to this park and play. Do you know why the bamboo is here? It is waiting for the wind to touch it.
I might. [GRUNTS] COGLIOSTRO: You see, you've been using your armor only by reflex. You must learn to control it.
You're too late again, Mr. Bond. It's a bad habit of yours. There's nothing you can do. T minus two minutes and counting. The missile's fully programmed.
Froget what our culture has made of the Djinn. Forget Barbars Eden. Forget Robin Williams. To the peoples of ancient Arabia, the Djinn was not cute nor funny. It was something else entirely.
Christian, for God´s sake do something unexpected for once! quiet while GROUP Oh, sorry. You gave me a shock. That shock was very, very important.
- Mr. Paladin the Office of Information seems to have anything but. An internal investigation is being conducted. Great. Could you tell us the nature of the investigation? Certainly.
Passed up over and over again for promotion. Living a life of honesty. Did you get my machine out of the warehouse? Yes, sir. Yes, I dusted it off myself.
That's a good one, Krincess Pelly. Thanks, Duncle Udley. That's the joke, don't wear it out. Today's Puppet Land story is " Curious George Converts to Judaism. " " Curious George was crossing Delancey when the wind blew off his yarmulke into the gutter. "
Come on. You know Jordan. She's got a gift. You can't suppress it. Your "gift" gave you a nervous breakdown. This "gift" makes you see horrible images.
Who loves ya, baby? Come on. It seems a Mongolian cluster flock has appeared. Dr Schlossburg's body is gone. It has been released.
- You got that right! One child is dead. Another one is missing. Some of us know all too well the pain... of losing a child. I hope this tragedy can bring us all together.
Actually, I'd have you strip searched. That might be fun. But in the interest of saving time... I've never seen a data crystal quite like this. Looks like it has a phase inverter embedded inside it. It's not going to be easy to decode.
He'll be stuck with 28 million people and no way to kill them. I'm glad you're amused, Quark. Lucky for us I can get hold of some Varaxian LM-7. I can get hold of some Varaxian LM-7. Never heard of it. It's a new biogenic weapon still in the experimental stage.
Tell them I need to meet with them immediately. As a Starfleet Captain or as the Emissary of the Prophets? Both. That'll get their attention. Remember the nonaggression pact the Dominion offered Bajor a few weeks ago? Yeah, they're still debating it in the Council of Ministers. It'll never pass.
That is not the way an apprentice should address her master. Maestro, your prince is going to come after us. The only escape is inside. Escape? We will be trapped inside. No. There is a wondrous invention inside this building.
I won't allow members of my crew to be condemned for a crime they did not commit. This has gone too far. We have to go to Bahrat. We'll end up in his cryostatic prison for decades. Not if he agrees to my plan. Your plan is crazy.
The hallucinations? Maybe so. Sometimes she's in a Borg vessel running...or hiding behind a bulkhead, falling down a shaft. Borg everywhere, chasing her. Nightmarish stuff. What about this...bird? She mentions it several times.
Sometimes she's in a Borg vessel running...or hiding behind a bulkhead, falling down a shaft. Borg everywhere, chasing her. Nightmarish stuff. What about this...bird? She mentions it several times. It flies at her, shrieking.
Maybe it isn't possible. When I tell you that time has moods... a disposition to be intuited... I'm not speaking metaphorically. What do you mean? Anger is one of its moods-- anger and the desire for... retribution, vengeance. Time itself has tried to punish me for my arrogance.
Get out! Major! Argh! What happened? The Goa'uld has won.

- Maybe I could use your shower. But first a drink. Then I will do anything you say. I had him hooked up, rolling, 41/2... 3 minutes. That was my best time. I didn't see that dog in the back seat.
Hey, at least I'm housebroken. Fucking time-waster. Thanks a lot, asshole. I'm throwing rocks tonight. Mark it, Dude. I'm telling you, this was a valued rug.
And next I saw this truck coming around the turn. And it was honking, trying to get us to move. I tried to grab her reins and... to get her horse to move out of the way. And the truck started to skid. And there was no time to do anything.
I tried to grab her reins and... to get her horse to move out of the way. And the truck started to skid. And there was no time to do anything. It ran right into Judith, and... And she just disappeared.
- Where is that girl? - Probably off catching rabbits with her teeth. Begging your pardon, my lady, but that mirror in your bedchamber did you move it? - Of course not. Why?
Yeah, I do. Where's our lawyer? I think we want to keep these proceedings... as pleasant as possible. I don't think a lawyer will be necessary. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction... occurred in full public view where it was accessible to... and in plain sight of minor children?
Your badge? It's just a star. Just another symbol. Your talisman. It can't stop criminals in their tracks can it?
Copy it and send it for me. Carpy, you're gonna send it yourself. Put it down! - It's got blood! - I see it. Carpy, I see it.
Carbon-based elements in the fossils... exist only in the Magellanic galaxy. That's 100 million light years away. Well, how did they get to Mars? By my reckoning... Mars was visited by an alien species... approximately one billion years ago. The species was like a plague, a cancer.
You're so confident. Only in bed. (rumbling) (car alarm) (Frank) It's a Broadway theatre.
You and your record label. " Why would he then signed a contract with to make someone to whom he has not believed? He has heard your music and it is good. Why hang around here any longer, take 'ne with him on board! If you hear your music means so much, you should do everything all to hear it.
Hi. I need to talk with you. - I know. That night was Todd Sparrow his soul air. He spat.
- The man was a cheat. - If anything occurs to you, call me, will you? ' DO YOU gamble? The world breaks everyone. And afterwards, many are strong at the broken places.
I am familiar with a certain anomaly that could be categorized as an "interspatial flexure." Where is it? Actually, a better question would be: Where is it now? It's really quite interesting. The aperture of the phenomenon-- which I prefer to call an intermittent cyclical vortex-- is unfixed.
- What? We're late. And please stop snapping at me! A pig liver transplant is experimental. Was the doctor appropriate in performing it?
Meet me in my quarters in one hour. I have something I wanna show you. And after that we're going to need you like we've never needed you before. Now, this catalog of various biologies will not be used for warfare, I assume. Now, why does everyone ask that?
We still don't know who he is or how to stop him or... - Doc. - Yeah? Any of your people do anything to this link? No, not that I know of. Why?
If there was a straight answer buried in there somewhere, I sure didn't see it. It was a parable. The willow is deceptively strong. It bends, but it does not break. Its roots are deep and can withstand the worst storm.
OK. I don't see what the big deal is. I'm not making a big deal. You wanted the orchid, you got the orchid. It goes with my complexion better.
- Me? I didn't do anything. The pointer on the spirit board. It moved on its own. I'm serious.
Before you take out any wall, you want to make sure that it's non-load bearing. Simplest way to do that is check out your blueprints. This wall is non-load bearing, so we can rip it out. And the safest, quickest way, is using a claw hammer. And to handle our debris, we'll be using this trash chute.
Lew? Oh, God. Oh, God. Manson, Bundy, Dahmer. Their cases are all well known. But the case I'm about to describe is so horrific, it should never be discussed outside this room. It challenged every preconception. It followed no rules.
Great! Another closet. We've chosen this spot for a reason. For one thing, it's a confined area with only two ways in or out: this one, and that one over there.
Bajor will be reborn. Shabren's Fifth Prophecy. The rebirth. If the Evil One is destroyed, it will bring a thousand years of peace. The golden age of Bajor.
So far, the crew hasn't found any evidence to support my doubts about Arturis. Nevertheless, I've told them to keep looking and to keep their optimism in check. But that's one order I don't expect them to follow to the letter... Daily Log, Seven of Nine, Stardate 51981. 6. I've analyzed the quantum slipstream technology of the Dauntless.
If nobody shows up to protest, I'd like to stay here for a while-- try to find the answers to some of these questions. This is the kind of archeological puzzle that's always fascinated me. Want a cup? No, thanks. You haven't mentioned your letter. Who was it from?
How many ships have you seen? Only one. Damaged. We tracked it across 50 light- years. We thought that we had killed the creature, but this prey is unlike any other.
I took my father's shuttle out for a joyride and proceeded to fry all the relays. I'm guessing he wasn't happy about getting it back. Actually, he didn't. As far as I know, it's still at the bottom of Lake Tahoe. Here it is. The coaxial induction drive.
How's it going tonight? She's still the same. Janet said that the Goa'uld left after it died. That's right. Um...
There was an energy burst, coming from the bridge of one of the ships,... ..recorded at 1750 hours. Just before they stopped. That's it? For all we know, that flash could be part of their ship's normal function. Except that the burst came from within the ship.
Apparently, we've got time to adjust. We really do have all the same sensations and perceptions that we did in our human form. Well, if you think about it, the human body is just a machine. It's a vessel for our consciousness, I mean. It's just an organic one.
Get in the car, Scully. No more screwing' around. We need a name. Your real name. Invisigoth. You want my address?
You can break their backs with proof about this virus. - Proof that what you say it does is true. - I don't have that proof yet. Maybe I can give it to you. There's a file folder.
It's the question that brought you here. You know the question just as I did. What is the Matrix? The answer is out there, Neo. It's looking for you.

I may have won a cruise! Oh, yes. Mikey! - Hi. Find the chopper? - Abandoned in Queens.
I said "buy" too many times, right? Let's eat. You got no lunchroom here? Here's what we got. We got a gun that was used in a homicide. Killed someone.
- Why? - This movie has naughty language! Next, please. - This can't be happening. - We have to see it.
You're to be gone by afternoon. Is that clear? -Quite clear. May I leave this letter with you? -Better send it from Lieksa.
There are no secrets [sounds like "hemmeligheder" in Danish] out here. Secrets [Hemmeligheder]? But there's a place here called "Hemmeligheder". - No! - Yes!
I don't know. lt's been a while. How much is an ounce? This is totally decent, and it's 300. This shit is top-of-the-line. It's called G-1 3. it's genetically engineered by the US government.
When I saw you two at the party the other night, you seemed perfectly happy. Call me crazy but it is my philosophy that in order to be successful, one must project an image of success at all times. What are you doing? I was filming this dead bird. Why?
-What is it? -Can't you come back? -Arvid... Remember when we had a cat? Why do you suppose it ran off?
Imperfection? Things like wrinkles, less-than-perfect teeth. Details like fading scars, little pockmarks. Look at my nose. See my nose?
I fucked up on Mary with the depth of field. You measured it in meters? We're not in Europe. The fucking lens has meters on it. It also has our system.
Casey is doing well. He's using all his best anecdotes, and Herbie now seems quite engaged in the conversation. - Felix is trying to get acknowledged. - Yeah, man. Fuckin' homegrown. Yeah, man, that homegrown shit's good, man.
I want to apologise about this morning. Do you remember the first day when you asked if the car wasn't working? I answered, "lt's given up the ghost." Do you remember? That day, we were driving uphill. The car gave up the ghost. Yes.
I haven't felt this good for a long time. Place me on your heart like a seal, like a signet ring on your hand. Wake up, lamet vav Pinches! Hear the Word of the Lord, Lord of the worlds whose anger was soothed by your prayers: The village of Polana will not be crushed by an iron rod, nor scattered like the desert sand.
Thank God! It's here! Be sure about yourself be fore you blame others. How can a purse drop off from a closed handbag? Even if it did, how did it get so far?
Elaborate. I went on the mission-- the one my mom told me about, the Borg sphere-- but it didn't work. Everybody got assimilated. Nightmares are caused by irrational fear. They're not real. They can't damage you.
Gachnar? Well, yes. Somehow the beginning of the spell must've been triggered. Gachnar's trying to manifest itself to come into being. - How?
We're in control here. Let's check again. Who's got the upper hand? Haven't you been paying attention? That gun won't do anything to us.
I'd rather not, Spike Spiegel. Oh, you know me? It's a popular story among criminals that we never want to be caught by you, or by Andy. Andy? I will fulfill my objective!
- Three or four. It started to work, you know. She said I had as much chance of being struck by lightning as I had of being bitten by a dog. So... what's the problem? Well, I was leaving the practice one day, feeling really well-adjusted and happy, and this fucking great Alsatlan came harlng down the road towards me, jaws slung with bloody slaver, eyes lit by the fires of Hades' eternal damned kingdom.
Wanna go into your party? They were playing the Timewarp, I hate the Timewarp! - Daisy likes it. - So what? ! I hate it!
- I see. - There's nothing to worry about. He's not trying to lure me to the Dominion. The Link is part of what we are. It comes as naturally to us as talking does to humanoids.
He claims you called for him. - Show him in. - As you wish. I remember when I first saw the gate of the Celestial Temple. I was on the Promenade.
Allow me to repair your program. Now, why would I want you to do that? You of all people should understand. Being unfettered by ethical subroutines has made me far more efficient. Status? I'm going to extract her cortical array.
You've deactivated your com system? And reinforced the shielding in this section. We won't be overheard.

This particular series has a class-1 1 intelligence factor.

- Good thinking. - It happens. Well, this is the place. Yeah. How do you open that door?
- It's an implant. I've seen this before. Yes. The drill... I remember the drill. I couldn't see it at first. That was the worst part.
Yeah, much better. The last one tasted like bat's piss. You can just pour it. You can just pour it. - How are you doing on that appetizer? I'm eating it.
- That I needed him urgently. Destitute. In serious trouble, the kind I couldn't sort out myself. Serious trouble, Nyah... is something I can always arrange. This transponder chip is completely untraceable.
-Hagen wants Spec to hold the flag. I'm gonna miss playing waiter. Don't hold nothing back. The ball moved. No.
Great work,Angels,but our job's only half-finished. There's still the matter of Mr.Knox's stolen technology. What's so special about your software? It's.... It's really quite amazing. We developed a program.You see,everyone's voice is unique.
- So,... .. I guess there's this urban myth goin' around here at the moment. It's about a beach. - Yeah? - Uh-huh. And this beach is... perfect, man.
To make a new life. Move them along! Move them along! When I'm through in Mombasa, I'll pick up her cradle. It should be ready by now.
Even the insolent Senator Gracchus was silent as a mouse. Why? I have been told of a certain sea snake... which has a very unusual method of attracting its prey. It will lie at the bottom of the ocean as if wounded. Then its enemies will approach... and yet it will lie quite still.
I'll sing, so you'll know where I am. After the bath, you'll be calmer. No more hitting on the head! All this trouble for a comb? It's mine.
I woke up on a sidewalk. I had no idea where I was. I couldn't have told you the city I was in. My head was pounding... and I looked down and my shirt is covered in blood. And as I'm lying there, wondering what happens next I heard a voice.
The board meets once or twice a week, and we take up important issues. - Yeah. Facts, problems. Things like that. Normal stuff. What kind of problems does an overnight success like Sunset Farms face? What kind of problems? Last week the toilet on the fourth floor wouldn't flush.
Who ever made it for you, you overpaid. What can I do if you're wrong? What can I do? Can I take your nose and twist it till you turn blue? Sure. Gee, you broke it.

So who the fuck wants to see them? I hope you can appreciate the concern I have for my friend Franky. I'll find him, and you'll help me find him. And we'll start at that fight. How am I gonna get it out?
Your death burns me. what's the matter? Listen. This tree's got duende. Sounds like a lament. This tree's got duende.
I had it changed in America. Was there a problem? It was going black. How odd. So the 4x4 is yours?
What's the time? - Seven o'clock. What's the matter Galindo? The clock in our house is always ten minutes slow. So?
The answers to which will reveal to me the truth. Five questions, Mr Poirot? Fire away. We know that Lord Edgware changed his mind on the subject of divorce and that he wrote to his wife to acquaint her of that. He sent it to the theatre.
I am not your hero, your great guy. I am your first and most important man, but nothing more. Understand? Yes, I understand, but you still have to get into bed. The pain is very deep.
Chamberlain's appeasement tragedy up to the agreement in Munich. And there were two people in the classroom! Terribly hard work, reading 4 pages and answering 2 questions. But when it's movie-time, suddenly everybody shows up! Maybe you can say something about the film.
"I don't ask any questions." She doesn't mention the night before. Have some foie-gras, Lover. Or would you prefer caviar? Anyway, you must taste this wine.
There were 5 left in your gun. If you add these up, 5 and 10 make 15. Since you aren't in the habit of loading an extra bullet, 15 matches the number you had to begin with. Then, what's this one bullet? It was neither shot by you nor recovered later.
Much worse. Now we're soul mates. Someone close the shutters. Seems wrong that I should die while the sun is still so bright. You'll not see it again.
- Yet they live. - Get the movers. - Yes, sir. Get it out of here. Nice. Lindsey, give me the scroll.
Back away from the door! Riley, are you OK? Secure the room. We got a demon in here. It escaped through that vent.
Riley, are you OK? Secure the room. We got a demon in here. It escaped through that vent. It's not the Polgara.
Neither Xander is a demon. - ls one of them a robot? - What? No. The rod device, it's called a ferula-gemina.
- Guys! - What? I think the spell is working. Do you see it? What's it doing?
If they've reached this stage of industrial development, they must be observing us. The probe's impulse thrusters are starting to fail. At its present altitude, it's been operating for over 200 years. Its orbit is becoming decayed. lnitiate self-destruct.
38 minutes. You're wasting time. Another maturation chamber is malfunctioning. Its autonomic nervous system is failing. It's Borg.
You're wasting time. Another maturation chamber is malfunctioning. Its autonomic nervous system is failing. It's Borg. It will adapt.
We've talked enough. Your requests are irrelevant. Comply, or we'll assimilate the others. It'll take us at least an hour to dismantle the deflector and transfer the components... Now. I can't give it to you now.
I've thought of a better use for you. Come along, Samwise. Be careful, both of you. The enemy has many spies in his service: Birds, beasts.
It is a fact that two opposing bio-etheric waves placed one over the other cancel each other out. It is theoretically possible to make a wave pattern in opposition to the Phantom energy. We are assembling such a wave and are near completion. Members of the council gathering plants and animals to fight the Phantoms is utter nonsense. The Zeus cannon is a proven, effective weapon.
Maybe we don't need so many. I sometimes wonder if we need them at all. They cost so much money! I want you to tell me what will happen to that stick. It will drown!
I sometimes wonder if we need them at all. They cost so much money! I want you to tell me what will happen to that stick. It will drown! Suppose it doesn't.
They cost so much money! I want you to tell me what will happen to that stick. It will drown! Suppose it doesn't. It will get stuck in the rocks!
So, this must be Machete. We're getting help from Dad's best man? What are you working on? World's smallest camera. I don't see it.
Choose? So this thing is alive? In a way. The crystal thrives on the collective emotions of all who came before us. In return, it provides power, longevity, protection.
Everybody knows I shaved for the "Don't Tell Your Papa" video. This is wiggedy-wack, Wyatt. What's wiggedy-wack is your damn monkey. - Oh, here we go with the monkey again. - Yes, here we go again.
Naturalist and taxidermist to the king and royal gardens... Sir de Fronsac had quite a reputation in Paris... for being a libertine and a sharp wit. As for the man that followed him like a shadow... he was a foreigner, and you knew nothing about him. As night fell... the two voyagers arrived at the castle of the Marquis d'Apcher... who had offered them refuge in the Gevaudan region... for as long as their mission endured. Our people would not be afraid of a simple wolf. The beast is different.
It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest and most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, Harry, who have never known your family you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it. Even gone mad.
Donnie Darko - what the hell kind of name is that? It's like a superhero or something. What makes you think I'm not? I should go. For physics, Montinoff is having me write this essay - the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.
Yes. If Martha doesn't find a replacement soon, I'll have my baby right here. My friend has been in bed for 6 weeks... In the tank, a lobster eats itself slowly from the inside. You have to weigh it when you buy it.
With Betty Lou here. I was practicing for my fireman's exam, which started seven minutes ago. So I'd appreciate it if you'd let me go. So you and the blonde found the meteor? Yeah, I found it.
JACK: Yeah, looks like it. Get back, son, you're going to lose a limb now. [Screams] Oh, God! JACK: It's flooded! BOY: Calm down, lady!
JODI: Exactly. All righty. Sure hope nothing stops you from becoming a viable entity because I hate when that happens. I'm billing you for that complimentary ice. You know, I really like this clay.
Anything else, Harker? Yes, sir. Yesterday, imagery Analysis delivered a file requested by Muir's secretary to your office. Did you receive that file, sir? I don't remember seeing it.
It's been lovely weather again today, hasn't it... out of the sun, of course. Ah, the fish! The fish from one of those very rivers of yours, eh, Captain Hastings? Oh, isn't that a sturgeon? They call it a hybiarria out here.
-What do you mean? -The ground is covered in dust. -How long will our footprints last? -A thousand years, maybe. This tunnel goes down.
You mustn't be off guard. Red. Here's a bug. It jumped! What bug?
And I'd gone to a job interview. And I was talking to one of the people, and I started asking them about what tools they used, and they said, "Gee, we used bison++!" and I said, "Oh, I am the author of bison++!" Free Software generally does have a copyright. It does have an owner.

Naoyuki Tomomatsu At the beginning of the 21st century all over the world 15 to 17 year old girls were dying by and by. Strangely enough the dead girls were reborn as zombies. Nobody knew why but those girls were called "Stacies". That name had become an international term.
Recently a girl suddenly turned into a Stacy. That's our task in the Rekill Research Laboratory, the former college of art for women. Any questions? How do you like this chainsaw? I used it for the first time today.
It's one book broken up into three pieces. - Like a trilogy. - No. Much more complex than that. See this passage?
- Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": - Your sister took my Key, Dawnie, and she won't give it back.
A most powerful one. - Can it be breached? The witch's magic pales to the might of our god. The infidel's wall shall tumble before us. Will?
That must be why we can't kill him, the whole nine lives thing. So if we kill him five more times he should be gonzo, right? No, that's exactly what you can't do. You see, once a familiar becomes a warlock, it has until the next new moon to purge itself of its old life. If it succeeds, it becomes immortal.
- Report. - We're losing main power. Trip, what's happening? That last bolt struck the warp manifold. We've got an antimatter cascade, sir.
You have to help me. Were you talking to yourself? That's less embarrassing. Yes. Yes, I was. "When she came in", I totally forgot about the camera.
- But wait. You need keys. - No, I don't. I so don't want to know why. The op-ed page is sad. It's worse than sad.
- How do you like that mouth? - It's not very mouth-like. - I think it works.
Yeah, and the key might go into him instead of you. Precisely, and that's why he is a very important part of this experiment. Because if the key does go into him, I shall press a second button and drop the pathetic little science student to his death. The key still won't go into you. We'll see.
Look, if you have a medical question, I'm forced by hospital policy to answer you. However, if you ask me about a personal problem, I'm going to start doing this. You seem unhappy. I like that. I cannot get that stupid song out of my head.
There are places a dick just can't go! Some dicks manage just fine. - Maria has ten dicks. - For the record, you started this. I am sorry, but a finger is not a dick.
-Can we change the name? -Whatever you want, baby. This is Rocco. He works for you. The ring looks beautiful on you.
As we venture out of our solar system, we hope to earn the trust and friendship of other worlds. Friendship I. I had to memorize that recording in third grade. Me, too. I even built a model of the probe. Then this should look familiar.
I thought you removed all her cybernetic systems. Computer, end program. Commander? If you're looking for your other holographic friend, he's off-line at the moment. Your cortical node began to shut down. Fortunately, I managed to stabilize it before there was any permanent damage.
You would be wise to follow lcheb's example. By applying himself, he's become a valued member of this crew. Can I see you naked again? Computer, run Diplomacy Scenario 12-Alpha. The planetoid is in Nausicaan space.
- your time is spent in the field. - She spent two years working on the gate prior to her five years of service at the SGC. She's the one who made this programme viable. Actually, the interface she designed is full of flaws. I admit it's not perfect, but it's...
Well... I was thinkin' about shootin' ya. Jack... what are you doing? Gettin' a little dirty for you, Maybourne? Bringing the gate room on line. The iris is holding, but it's starting to heat up.
The forests are heavily patrolled. - We're not done, pal. - I so own you. There is a device in the chest that sensors indicate may be a power unit. Current status: deactivated.
You're saying something was inside our computers? We're just guessing at this point, but... Whatever it was, we interrupted it before it completed its scan of our computer. Did you determine any more from the MALP transmissions? Nothing on or off world resembles the architecture.
- (vehicles approach) Never mind. This image was generated from satellite observations made in the last few hours. The asteroid has an irregular shape, but we've calculated its length from end to end to be approximately 137 kilometres. I've seen this movie.
Never mind. This image was generated from satellite observations made in the last few hours. The asteroid has an irregular shape, but we've calculated its length from end to end to be approximately 137 kilometres. I've seen this movie. It hits Paris.
Been shut down for years. You see this, Agent Scully? You have this on your graphic? Yeah. lt's a fork in the line. That line is obsolete.
How are you doing? He is super fine. because the boy was employed in the funeral parlor. Go back to the funeral parlor! This autopsy is rustic. Nothing was done.
My father was killed in battle too. In Ireland, in the streets fighting those who would take as their privilege what could only be got and held by the decimation of a race. That war is 1 000 years old or more. We never expected it to follow us here. It didn't.
AND NOW THE HARD-LINERS HAVE THEIR PROOF. WE CANNOT TRUST THE WEST. YOU... YOU TOOK AWAY MY SON. YOUR FIRING SQUAD SHOULD HAVE DONE THE JOB FOR ME. I HOPED A WESTERN EDUCATION WOULD HELP HIM BECOME A BRIDGE... BETWEEN OUR WORLDS.
I got to figure this out. So figure it out. You take care of this car? What do you mean? The tires felt a little splashy on the way over here.
FOR EXAMPLE, WHILE THE STUDENT BODY IS AWAY, E COMPUTER WILL SHUT DOWN ALL NON-ESSENTIAL SYSTEMS. NOW, THE PREFECTS ARE HERE. THE COMPUTER WILL BECOME AWARE OF THEIR PRESENCE, AND TAKE CARE OF ALL THEIR NEEDS. AWARE OF THEIR PRESENCE? THAT IS THE GENIUS OF THE N2K, MR. WALSH.
You remember Dad's friend? Jack Barnes. From the club. He came by looking for your father. I was giving him a tour of the apartment.
What you up to? I don't wanna bother you. Just thought I'd call and get some more info. I think you say some pretty smart things, John. Yeah, smartest guy I know, huh? So whatever happened to your nursery?
You're a faggot. Tell me, Mr. Barris. Are you in possession of my microfilm? - I got it. - Let's have it, then.
That's what I'm telling you. It's too late. There isn't anybody who can help you. In good conscience, I should say the custody hearing is probably a trick. It's not about itself.
Hello? Jack, it's Lloyd Bowman. I solved the code. You need to know what it says right now. Okay, Lloyd.
By calling me here, you people have committed a grave mistake. Really? Now apologize for your mistake and tell me... When do I get to go? When we find the truck. - And when will you find it?
Anyway, I brought a few items from home that might prove, ahem, embarrassing were the Ministry to call. Just poisons and the like. Look at that. That particular item is not for sale. I understand.
Well, without the dinner theatre, we'd see each other less. I want to restart my career. You're kidding, right? - Well, what about my equipment? - Good news.
I'll stop you on the road to the land of the dead. Hear the dog howl and come back! I'll hold you firm and stop you from leaving your body. Hear the dog howl! It protects your hearth.
Perhaps. The thought of a grave with no name... Shall we sit on the couch and listen to some music? The spring of God is never dry You can drink and slake your thirst
Yes sir. Let's go. All team members get ready for the orders. The storm is coming. Typhoon 13 is heading north and rapidly gaining strength.
But... I'm a fallen woman. That's no fault of yours. You're not fallen. You're just unfortunate. But a body once soiled can never be made pure.
There's a return ticket from Italy in her pocket. - Probably from another trip. - It's dated last week. Why wouldn't she tell us about a trip to Italy? You are looking at a schematic of a Westbury 23 supercomputer.
The floorboards over there lift up. This safehouse has saved me before. You know what would be great right now? A fire in that fireplace. I heard a chopper.
-Ally! Even on vacation in Bermuda, you're not what I would call voracious. I'm a nibbler, right? I'm sorry. The sex was polite.
I had this enormous crush on Madelyn Pruitt. -I was in love with her. -Senior year in high school? Yes. And one day I found this note in my desk.
But somewhere, people all forget what a mess youth is. It's a time of magic, all right. And there's nothing more unreliable or annoying than magic. Let me tell you a little story. It starts with a kid.
It's Spike. He can hurt me... without his head exploding. Oh, my God. His chip stopped working? No.
But he'll never say he loves you until he trusts you. And he'll never trust you until you tell him what you really are. You see why I always win these bargains. As an immortal being, I'm afraid only you can give up your life. Place this auger shell over your heart.
You're probably right, but she's an interesting evil specimen. Reminds me of this water demon I read about in the Book. She kills in the most fascinating way. - Paige. - What?
She kills in the most fascinating way. - Paige. - What? We know how it kills. What'd I say?
My God, I'm sorry. Well, just take it back. I'm sure they'll fix it for you. Uh... couldn't you take it back? I don't even know where this store is.
- Yes. Let me ask you a question, Doc, just out of curiosity. Are there any dogs on your home world? The Denobulan Lemur is highly sought after. It's not exactly a dog, but you could say it's doglike.
They brought the weapons online right when we needed them. If you have no objection, I'd like to make it standard procedure. No objection, sir. You still need to work on that alarm. I'll get right on it.
Yeah, and if we weren't trapped with only two weapons, about to die. Well, good new is, who better to save a Leviathan than us, huh? Hmm! So, we stay away from doggie, we find the Grudeks and we bring them down. So.
What is happening? ! It's in the frelling ship, the plant is in the frelling ship. Pilot, how far has it spread? I can't tell.
Pilot... what the yotz is wrong with the lights? I don't know! Well that's hardly good enough, is it? Find the problem, and fix it. Chiana, put it away.
- Wait a second. You, there, when Lady Godiva here wanted to be town troubadour over you... I stood by your side. Why aren't you backing me now? 'Cause you left me twisting for a long time before you did, and it didn't feel good. I wrote a song about the experience. I heard it.
Hey there, Mr Mouth. What have you got to say that is so important? I'm sorry. lt's been non-stop. This chair is a little controversial. But I don't give a shit.
Clark called, said he needed my help. I figured out how Lana got her visions. The explosion. You think the blast caused them? More than that.
- And Jonas, he's at least as smart as you. - There isn't always a way out. - If that was true, I'd be dead by now. How many more times can you go into that sarcophagus before it changes you? How many times has it been already?
Yes, it does. Guts, or a familiarity with alternative lifestyles. -What are you chasing? -Toyota Camry. Whose?
She moves any way she wants, as far as she wants. And she is the go-get-shit-done piece. Remind me of Stringer. And this, over here, is the castle. It's like the stash.
Your mind is always in the gutter. There was no call. Tom Wilkins, 11:48. In my experience, there's usually not a three-hour lag... between the call... and the delivery. When she first came in that night, she didn't have the pack.
I looked into your future, and I saw death. But there is also life. You saw there was a child. You saw my son. That future is almost gone.
So do I. Tell me how I separated my mind from my body without jacking in. Tell me how I stopped four sentinels by thinking it. Tell me just what the hell is happening to me. The power of the One extends beyond this world.
I am the government and I'm asking you. Let me. You're brave. They say that sea urchin's the ultimate acquired taste. Hmm. It's a personal favourite of mine.
Pour it into them, boys! Fill that line in! Fill this hole now! Dress to the right! Fire!
Marquez, he really had it in for this Mariachi, see. They called him "Mariachi" because he used to carry this guitar. A guitar? Believe me, he really knew how to play it too. Look, this story is well-traveled.
Yeah, but you look great. What's the matter? It's these dreams, Doctor. I keep having them, and they're terrible. Tell me about your dream.
- Why? Does somebody have a can of air freshener? Quick and dirty. The thin skin, that's the Earth's crust. That's what we live on.
Theo! Theo! Theo! Theo! A revolution isn't a gala dinner.
If you had to choose. If you were forced to make a choice. If there was no other... Well then, if you're going to push me, I would choose the right-hand weevil.
Orderly after orderly is chasing us. Mom and Josephine are at the end. No time to explain! Stall them! We come flying out over the kerb... and your old red Charger is there.
-Not likely. -Do you have a wrench, Green? -No. Is it the fan belt? Yes.
Goal! 3-2 for Germany over Hungary, a team that hasn't lost a game for 4 1/ 2 years. The second hand is moving so slowly. I stare over at it. Speed up! Faster!
Michael, look at the rest of the pictures. Look at the last one. Oh, my God. It's the future. The machine predicts a war, and we go to war to avert it.
Cancel activation. - You are not authorised. - How do we stop this thing? - You can't. The Rook is a fully autonomous operative. Its body armour is five times more effective than the armour you wear now.
- Lasse, come on! - What? Well... I have an idea. It may sound stupid, but I've been thinking it over.
I bid you welcome... to the Hall of Odin. Uh, listen, Mr Hellstrom, you've caught some bad breaks... but there's no reason to take it out on the world. - I know you. - It's the spear. Its power is one of destruction.
The wine looks splendid in the glass. And onto the plate lovely fish, with rice, onions, lemon, and a green sauce. With it, a bottle of chablis. How does the perfect human eat? The fish is a beautiful sight on a table.
Then these people apply for a charter as a corporation. This government issues a charter to that corporation. Now that corporation operates legally as an individual person it is not a group of people it is under the law a legal person. Imperial Steel Incorporated has many of the legal rights of a person. It can buy and sell property...

Imperial Steel Incorporated has many of the legal rights of a person. It can buy and sell property... It can borrow money. It can sue in court and be sued.
And for 35 years, I used them honestly. After that, nobody wanted them. So I was forced to go into business for myself. As for being a mass killer, does not the world encourage it? Is it not building weapons of destruction for the sole purpose of mass killing?
Has she given you that? Who else? Look at this. Is not that great? Jill can you get the idea.
A plane? Why? There's something I've gotta tell you. It'll be hard to hear, so I need you to stick with me. We found the bomb. It was wired in a way that made it impossible to diffuse it.
- This is Ryan Chappelle. - Hello. - Jack Bauer is on the line as well. He'll give you an update. Mr President, I found the chip. Unfortunately, it's been badly damaged.
The sun is not cold in the winter. Me know you's been axed this a zillion times, it must really get on your tits being axed it, but let's just sort it out. What do you say to all those conspiracy theorists who come up to you and say: 'Does the moon really exist? ' I don't think there are very many people who question whether the moon exists.
This is the last thing Gendler saw. It's Sloane. I've chartered a C-123 out of Shipman to transport the artifacts. I will be in touch. "Shipman" could refer to the airfield in the Mojave desert. We've surveilled it before.
WO-PANG: Must acquire better guards. Angel's soul has been stolen. I have no need for the vampire's soul. Then where is it? That I cannot discern.
Welcome to the big leagues, Angel. You're a champion. You don't get personal days. There's nothing on this Beast, Lorne. I fought it once. It nearly decapitated me with my own stake.
You're a champion. You don't get personal days. There's nothing on this Beast, Lorne. I fought it once. It nearly decapitated me with my own stake. It's killed hundreds that I couldn't save.
Thank you. I just don't understand how all this could have happened. How what could've happened? This. Piper's club.
- Well, for starters, I have a job. Well, I'm your boss, I'll transfer you. Okay, and how about my family? My sisters and my new little nephew? You can use the jet whenever you want.
- Where's your sugar? - Sugar's in the sugar bowl. That's my cup. I'm the only one drinks out of that cup. Rinse it out and put it back where you found it.
Not at all. We charge our weapons the same way. Well, maybe you'd like to see the phase-cannon assembly. Please. After you.
Thermal shear. Some of those eruptions are getting close to Enterprise. - Take us up another 5,000 kilometres. - Aye, sir. Captain... I'm reading bio-signs on the planet. To quote Dr Frankenstein, "It's alive."
They hate you guys. Well, I liked it there. You see the show? - No. - You should.
I'll signal Lo'Lah and then we go! - We must destroy them. - Why? The mother plant is the key. It fertilizes the others.
- I'm sorry. I told you to get it back three hours before... I actually needed it back, and it worked out. - You rat. - So, it's in park?
Uh, like most newbies. Quiet, green, gullible. Bi. I don't think so. / No, Tony, the canister.
Just do what you came here to do. Forgive us, Sovereign. It is the only way to protect our people. I will not surrender this body, not at any cost. It is mine.
Harry, you're under arrest. I've got the stone and I'm walkin' out that door. You're not in a strong bargaining position. The mission will only be successful if I'm on it. That stone is useless without the combination. How's that?
You're not in a strong bargaining position. The mission will only be successful if I'm on it. That stone is useless without the combination. How's that? It was originally found over 80 years ago in a pharaoh's tomb in Egypt.
Ain't no nigger from New York gonna change the facts from the ground. All right? 12-08 to 11-37, you there? 11-37, what you got? That last truck is on the move.
There is a story, Riddick, of young male Furyans... strangled at birth. Strangled with their own cords. When Aereon told this story to the Helion leaders... I told her of you. What do you know of your early years? Do you remember your homeworld?
Good. I'll take it. Ten-four. Units, stand by... unless you have an emergency. License and registration. I'm gonna need you to pop the trunk for me. I gotta open it myself.
Just undiscovered science from an American... named Thomas Edison. - It turns on with a whistle. please, don't do that. I see your eye is drawn to what I hope will oneday... be my crowningachievement. It's a flying machine.
It's not them you should worry about. - What did you say ? You're right, I'm sorry. I should have called. Where's your book bag ? I left it at school.
Isn't he a wizard or something, is he? He was very gentle. And he saved me. So you had your heart stolen, haven't you? If that wizar had been Howl, your heart would have been eaten.
Thank goodness. Fortunately, my teeth are as well as before. That is best suitable as a cane, isn't it? Well, then... Ouch!
Right away! When the right adjustment valve starts to vent put in the ball. Hurry! Stop wasting time! It is with the greatest pleasure that we declare this Exhibition of Science open.
To answer your question the objection is in writing, signed by a number of members of the House of Representatives, but not by a member of the Senate. Mr. President, it is in writing and signed by several House colleagues on behalf, and myself, of the 27,000 voters of Duval County in which 16,000 of them are African-Americans that was disenfranchised in this last election. Is the objection signed by a member of the Senate? Not signed by a member of the Senate. The Senate is missing.
There is a secret test hidden within the SAT. This test does not measure a student's aptitude at reading, writing and arithmetic.
It can't be done. Let me prove it to you. OK, Ben, pay attention. I've brought you to the Library of Congress. Why?
It's not here. It's there. Come on. - What bell is this? - It's the Centennial Bell.
Color in red wines comes from the skins. This juice, on the other hand, is free-run. So that there's no skin content.... Did you read the latest draft? -Oh, yeah. Yeah. -And?
Because a bottle of wine is actually alive. And it's constantly evolving and gaining complexity. That is, until it peaks. Like your '61 . And then it begins its steady, inevitable decline.
The device you're wearing is hooked into your upper and lower jaws. When the timer on the back goes off, your mouth will be permanently ripped open. Think of it like a reverse bear trap. Here, I'll show you. There's only one key to open the device.
Let me, I know how. Me too... You can see La Jument. In line with the reefs. Looks small from here.
He won't get well if you don't take care of him. Tell me. - What do you mean? If I'm going to save your ass tell me where the container is and who you're dealing with. Where is it?
Looks like leather work, sir. - Oh, right. - Sir, we got the weapon. Come on, pick it up. Been in the pool, destroyed any fingerprints that might have been on it.
Got a beer? What happened? A clarification with Geneviève. I'm selling the apartment. We had an extremely sharp discussion.
There you can see 19th century lobbyists, like Manual García and Beláustegui, or the latest heads of the public banking system, Pedro Pou, Macarrone and Colombo, administrators of a debt that was born in the 197 0s under the military dictatorship. We have turned the page of government interventionism... The present debt was the illegitimate offspring of the military dictatorship. Even though the Courts demonstrated its fraudulent origins, the pressure of the Establishment won the day.
No, I'd rather not. Come, I'll show you something else. These are her musical scores. The ones they found on the bridge. Music on its own is silent.
Sit down, older brother. Collé, have you gone mad? How dare you expel my elder from my house? Young brother, have you given up your authority as a husband? Purification dates way back.
Elevation change. You learned these yesterday. Questions? Yes? This book says the English 'Armstrong' cannon has a vent piece, so you don't have to stick your finger in it.
I was never here. You understand me? Julia, you tell me right now that you understand what I'm saying. I understand. Stop that process.
Not this day. ANGEL: Tell me what was in that box. A name, a history, anything. - We can't get it open. WESLEY: Where did it come from?
I agree. It's the only place he can go to avoid being sensed. Which means he must have both of our Wyatts there too. Still, it's too vast. We have to narrow it down.
Okay, everyone, settle down, please. We have something very special to share with you today, a very special report on the Komodo dragon by Francis Bischetti. "The komodo dragon, or varanus komodoensis," by Francis Bischetti. The komodo is found exclusively on the indonesian islands of Komodo, Rintja, Padar, Gili, and Mota.
It wasn't my idea. The orders came from Starfleet, but after seeing this... I can't say I disagree. We were defending our right to exist. You've already killed over 25 people. Your existence has a pretty high price.
How do you plan to get inside it? We're pretty sure we found a way in. I'm sending a crew in a shuttlepod. The spheres are controlled by a network of artificial intelligence. This section houses a redundant memory core.
What my husband did to you today -- it was a misunderstanding. No, I got it. Loud and clear. It was the watch. Your husband tried to murder me for a watch? I found this watch two days ago.
Send her my love. Well, I was hoping that wouldn't be necessary. That's why I'm here. I was hoping you might come back with me to Los angeles. I'm producing a new game show.
See, you i did figure for the party line type. What's that supposed to mean? Why was there only one prototype made? I funded all the RD personally. I don't have pockets that deep. This loss is just devastating.
- You matched them. - I did. But here's the bad news. This particular brand is like the prom queen of tyres. It's very popular.
- I don't give a fuck. You can sit in there till fucking San Gennaro. It'll still need to be dealt with. This car went through a major collision. It seems OK.
I told you, Bulrog has lots and lots of powers. Behold. This way, I can move about the crowd of people undetected. - Here, hold this stuff for me. - Good luck, Bulrog. Now, this lamp comes from the estate of Edna and James Hollinger, who lived in upstate Wyoming.
Once you complete the scenario or if you engage the internal fail-safe, - which you're free to do at any time. - That will be unnecessary. Don't be so cocky. The chair is intuitive.
What is it? I found the cipher. I'm downloading it now from the subspace link. - I have it. - We need to load it into the mainframe.
His white cell count is coming down. - What about Colonel Vaselov? - He's not so good. We're treating him with antibiotics, but he is deteriorating. Until we know more about the source of the infection, there's not much we can do.
- What does that mean? - Some sort of genetic research? - No, she's over 20 years old. The Asgard can rapidly grow a human clone, but... Area 51 has a sample of Goa'uld nanite technology from the planet Argos.
Maybe on an ark? I got it. It's one of Anna's sketches. I think it's a combination to open the ark. - Did we just do that? - I do not believe so.
Oh! So what's Ishta think of all this? Ishta believes traditions should persist at all costs, especially in the face of oppression. I see. Rya'c is too young to know what love is, O'Neill.
I'd say we're under several hundred feet of ocean. This could be a problem. Oh, no! Dr Weir, I need to see you in the control room immediately. The city has a shield, a force field holding the water back.
Perfectly charming. Long ago this city was a testament to our imagination, our creative spirit, to endless possibility. How long ago was that? We have been forced to rebuild many times, never to our potential. That is why perfecting the drug is so important.
Long ago this city was a testament to our imagination, our creative spirit, to endless possibility. How long ago was that? We have been forced to rebuild many times, never to our potential. That is why perfecting the drug is so important. It is more than a defence against the Wraith.
Nine mil, point-blank. Not much worse I can do without killing the major. I believe the creature is related to the Wraith. - Really? - How so?
Assholes. We'll start the interior construction within the week. Which means we need to readdress the budget. Readdress how? Well, for one, the price of steel has doubled.
I made her do everything. Well, that's gonna be up to the prosecution, Mr. Kraus. Now, would you mind telling us how this whole thing went down? When I got out in '91, the first thing I did was go looking for Lauren and Serene. I went over to her apartment.
- And beautiful. - But cruel. I mean, I'm not saying it's her fault. She can't help what she is. But look at that beak.
I said I'm a real person, asswipe! ...Oh my God. What's happening? The robot... It thinks it's alive.
Don't you want your animal? Come. I claim this cow for the damage it did. Take it back to them. If you don't the soldiers will come.
Does the cape flow? I mean, it was nearly impossible. Some of the things have legs, and some of them have less legs. The cape has less legs, let's face it. It was constantly being changed for various reasons.
The blood moon comes tonight. It has to do with the eclipse. It has to do with the eclipse. Listen to me. We know why your forest is enchanted.
Are you feeling better, Ishtar? I'm well again, Grandfather. Bab'Aziz, I heard a cat. So did I. Let me down! It must be lost.
So you admit that you did something. I admit, according to you, I did something, sure. - You dimed me out. - I did not dime you out. When the sheriffs asked where you got the car, I said I didn't know.
Do you think everything's has something it's supposed to do or be? Kind of a nice thought. I sat here a lot of times. I looked at this tree and i wondered if that branch had a purpose. Maybe it's here... to provide shade.
- Not a chance. Nobody but me can keep this heap running. Besides, from the sound of things, you might have to shoot somebody. - I don't have a gun. - Under the seat.
Is it terrorists? No, this came from someplace else. - What do you mean, like, Europe? - No, Robbie, not like Europe! That machine, it was already buried.
It's strange to hear your voice. I wanted to tell you I got your letter. And? I suppose you found it ridiculous. I was touched by it.
Hmm? I've thought a lot about the soul. It's found in the body and so... Uh-huh. I think it moves around.
I can't compete with her. you don't have to compete with her. Liar. You don't have to do this. As if the act in itself mattered.
Don't you know what we've already done? Your skin is different from I remember. The texture is different. How? Rougher? No, not rougher.
It's a miracle. Hey! Hey! Who's going to take advantage of this now? This surveillance is terrible. Yes, it is.
Dawa, where is my ball? Here, try. I don't want to play. Where is my ball? I traded it.
You've made an old man piss in his pants. Why are you following me? Why? I saw a dog once. Two kicks - And its back was broken.
I can just go to that file and flip through it and see those pictures. As if I had just seen it yesterday. The atomic age ushered in the first great age of movie science-fiction. When you come through the Second World War you've got a very specific enemy. You know what that enemy is.
And that's what that movie kind of was saying at the end. Four, three, two, one, fire. I don't understand. Why did it destroy the thunder? Why? Why?
Then it caused far greater unhappiness, which pleased the magician even more. Some of those fragments were made into spectacles. And those who looked through them saw only bad things. But how does the story end? It has never ended.
Me? An old maid... An old maid? You are joking. I have a surprise for you.
We want to give it the best chance we can. We don't want it closing as soon as it opens, like Murder In Mayfair. Close, did it? That's a surprise! The malachite table is especially nice.
You know why? They were tolerant. I don't like the word "tolerant". If you have to tolerate someone, it means you there's no equality. I believe... that all violence stems from sexual repression.
Put me in a position to bail. There he is. I got you covered. Clear. Tell me where the missile is. Tell me where it is.
They'll assume he was behind it. And what about the damage it'll do to threst of the infrastructure? A lot better than destroying the entire company. It'll take some time, but we can rebuild. yeah? The EMP has been activated, sir. And the shield door is open. Okay, good.
Of course not. I need to set a relay closer to the building so I can boost your signal. - Copy that. - Got it. I can do it.
Sir, I think I've found what's causing it. What is that? (Baltar) A Cylon logic bomb. A heuristic computer virus. It's capable of learning, evolving.
Yeah. Good. Then you won't mind going on a little trip with me. I know the power-switching spell is in here. We've used it before.
There's no more information, sir. I personally escorted the Prime Minister from the cabinet room to his car. This is Oliver Charles, transport liaison. The car's disappeared. There's no record of it, sir.
The Daleks destroyed my home, my people. I've got nothing left. Look at it. What's it doing? It's the sunlight.
Fixed his head. That's all I needed. Cup of tea. - I said so. - And look at him. Is it him, though?
Board that ship! Take everything you can! Captain's Starlog, January 13,2155. We've left Gorlan Station and have set a course... to rendezvous with our assault fleet. Major Reed and the Doctor have asked for a few minutes... to show me their latest project. The Booth will be far more effective than our previous disciplinary methods.
It's going from weird to weirder. - The usual beverage for everybody? - So he's not your dog? It just showed up in our yard yesterday morning. We have no idea how it got here, where it came from.
Are you familiar with quantum physics? Mm. Oh, then it is the Unified Field Theory. The unified what theory? Simply, Einstein's... attempt to... explain the mind of God. Well, that's a marvelous way of looking at it.
Lucrative business. Everybody needs boxes. Which reminds me -- your sneaker factory in Canada -- I have a sneaker factory in Canada? Well, not anymore.
Everybody needs boxes. Which reminds me -- your sneaker factory in Canada -- I have a sneaker factory in Canada? Well, not anymore. It was destroyed in a fire last month.
Just ask her. I'm not gonna ask her that, Mr. Monk. And of course we can't press all of our wine like this. It would take too long. But we do make one label using this method. The allacco cabernet.
Yeah. My husband, he's -- he's an english lit professor. Very, very popular with the undergraduate girls. All my efforts over all these years, and the only thing that works for me is history. I judge it.
- Too wild and crazy? - To do that, we must reactivate the cells. I know. What makes this place so special? The temple at Dakara is sacred to all Jaffa.
And you're telling me this... why? Because you must destroy it before my fleet arrives to claim it. All right, you got me. I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about. The weapon on Dakara was built by the Ancients.
I want a status report as soon as his radio's working. Caldwell out. Nice stalling! Have you been unable to disconnect yourself from the system? No. I'm still trying to get the information on that communiqué. Oh good. We thought maybe it was preventing your from exiting the program.
Months? Weeks? - Days. We have days. OK, what's the plan? I've injected him with a viral inhibitor.
That's what they wanted all along. A new feeding ground. That still doesn't explain who killed Dr. Monroe and Dr. Lindstrom. That's what I'm trying to tell you. It was the virus. Look, it's an A.I., an artificial intelligence.
We're veering off course. Navigational controls are not responding. Damn it! Engine room, what's happening? The virus, it's back!
She wasn't. She was cremated. What about that mirror? It's not in some evidence lockup, is it? No.
I heard.... I thought I heard.... There was this voice. -What did it say? -lt said....
You're always hungry. So if that's true, how can Tommy still be alive? -You're not gonna like it. -Tell me. More than anything, a Wendigo knows how to last long winters without food.
So if that's true, how can Tommy still be alive? -You're not gonna like it. -Tell me. More than anything, a Wendigo knows how to last long winters without food. It hibernates for years at a time.
-You're not gonna like it. -Tell me. More than anything, a Wendigo knows how to last long winters without food. It hibernates for years at a time. When it's awake, it keeps its victims alive.
Listen, there's something I wanna talk to you about. Am I in trouble? The mountain lion you shot did it have a collar around its neck? No. Did it make kind of a meowing sound?
- Unfortunately, his alibi checked out. - What about the lawyer? Security guard clocked him leaving his office after midnight. - Did you find the ad? - Yeah.
Jack! Stop it, now. What the hell's going on? The case is closed. What you mean it's closed?
I will help you find Barbara Stritzke. But afterwards.. . The Legion gets the comb. AII right. deal. What does the comb do?
Ihaveneverwitnessed such splendour, butitpaledbycomparison with the magnificent Ruby of Agrapur. I see the Ruby intrigues you, Major Marchbanks. It was discovered in Burma six centuries ago. and given in tribute to the princely house of Agrapur. It is beautiful. A fatal beauty alas, the cause of many deaths.
Where is the keystone? Do not test me! - Let her go! - Don't hurt her. Give me the keystone! Give it to me! Here!
What are you doing? I'm sorry. Oh, the map. It's ruined. The Grail.
With this. My compass is unique. "Unique" here having the meaning of "broken". True enough, this compass does not point north. Where does it point?
I'll be right back. You feel that? It's happening. Someone's helping us. Send the energy back.
Sure, in 1967 there were many suicides. But why in 1977? You must explain. You must describe the social conditions more clearly. It should remain literature, not political agitation. The text is great. I just want to be sure people understand it in the West.
- Talked to her before she died. - You did? She called. We were still talking when we reached the location. We didn't make it in time... Tell me about it.
Beautiful creatures. I'd never make the grade. At the end of my vacation I crept into Jane's room. I jerked off on my mother. And this fucking cat was watching me the whole time.
Friday. - Excuse me! - Excuse me! Your wallet. It was in your jacket. Oh, thank you.
- Come on. Tell me about the stone. Is it clear or is it milky? Clear. And the color, is it strong?
Very tough thing to accomplish, by the way. I'm proud of myself. Well, you look terrific. Thanks. I heard your trip went really well.
No, it's France. And this is war! Chartreux, look. Look at this bible. Look at it! It saved my life. It stopped a bullet hitting me in the heart.
And this is war! Chartreux, look. Look at this bible. Look at it! It saved my life. It stopped a bullet hitting me in the heart. It speaks of courage and the honour of sacrifice.
Astrid became the mother and sister I'd lost. And an inspiration for survival. Come on! Excuse me. Where does this road lead?
This had better be good, Mr Santilli. (Muffled cries) ls there someone in the boot? Just concentrate on telling me about this film. Well, it's the most unbelievable thing you've ever seen. Unbelievable.
- What about her? - l think she is not well. Be kind enough to call upon her, and send to me the bill? Of course. The murder weapon is not what killed him.
- No. That lousy medicine makes me powerless. What the hell is happening? I think you should go, Klara. There is nothing for you to do here. Don't talk like that to Klara.
What? And leave my good-paying job as a stripper? My mother was a nurse in Puerto Rico. Minimum wage. - Do I believe this story? - Why not?
Sheriff, you there? Stay awake. Stay awake till... Does this bus have a gas can? If the bus...
But we are still by all odds the largest contributor. And so it is up to us to look at how we think about it, because our way of thinking is the third and final factor that transforms our relationship to the Earth. If a frog jumps into a pot of boiling water, it jumps right out again because it senses the danger. But the very same frog, if it jumps into a pot of lukewarm water that is slowly brought to a boil, will just sit there and it won't move. It'll just sit there, even as the temperature continues to go up and up.

But why are you here? You think I'm the same as you? Do you remember what you've done? all the strange things started to happen after writing the Recycle It's because of this? This place is created by you.
In the first place, they haven't done you any harm. In the second place, they may be radioactive. If they fall in the reservoir, they may contaminate the water supply. Save your time and ammunition, Benson. Shot on a dusty backlot in Culver City, California, in just 12 days the movie was a box-office success.
Hold on, Bill. It's a remote timing display. Can we defuse the detonator? Not in 60 seconds. We'll have to get it out of here.
How much time do I have? Weeks. A month at the outside. Unless the cancer goes to your brain. I'm afraid the tests are positive. The mass is malignant.
Mission rules say we head back. Frak me! It was the first jump! Hey, look, you gave me these coordinates. Back to the barn. Hey, I'm picking up a large planetary body.
I really don't want the rainforest to die. Well, that's what will happen if you open the red door. Hello, IT. Have you tried turning it off and on again? OK.
Well, we're happy to have you. Oh. Oh! My milky lens has popped out! Don't step on it. You've got to help me find it.
Hi. Mr. Cain says he was home last week. But he didn't see anything. / Excuse me. That box is addressed to Joanne Raphelson. Yeah.
It's about the doll and the garage door. It's about both. Mr. Cain, where did you get that doll? I... / Come on. You stole it, didn't you?
- Whoa, whoa, wait. This inspection sticker expired yesterday. - Yeah, I'm taking care of that tomorrow. - Expired. It's expired. Mr. Monk, it's a million dollars. Please get in the cab for me.
Rand knows that Caledonia has nothing even close to capable of reaching orbit. Although, there do appear to be sensors built into the targeting system, so our approach may be detected. The Prometheus is protected by Asgard shield technology. Exactly. Now, as I said, even if they do see us coming, the weapon will take a few minutes to charge up.
Sounds like you're on its side. I sympathize, that's all. The Isolus has caused a lot of pain for these people. It's a child. That's why it went to Chloe. Hmm. Feels to me like a temper tantrum cos it can't get its own way.
Your mom said some pretty horrible stuff about him when we were growing up. I think I saw him. When I was in the chair. Lincoln... It was him.
I told you not to leave this room. I told you not to let him out of your sight. Dad just grabbed us and booked. Dropped us off at Pastor Jim's about three hours away. By the time he got back to Fort Douglas, the Shtriga disappeared.
Where is it? Where is it? The vaccine was in here! Where is it? You were bringing me back here! Where is it?
They're about to remove Hannah's liver. All right, I'm good to go. You can start removing Max's liver. You wanna let me in on what the big secret is between these two? You read Foreman's article?
Wait a minute. - This doesn't make any sense. It's headed straight for the planet where we left Beckett and the prisoners. There's no reason for the Wraith to be interested in that planet. No stargate, and no indication it ever supported a human population.
Not even dying could be so good. Let me smell your neck, your breath, your hair... After that long wait, when I thought I'd lost you. Last night I saw a shooting star. But I'm so silly, I couldn't think of a wish to make.
So I'm asking you now: Have you ever had an orgasm? This cheese is good... Like some? You must be out of your mind! You don't have to make it breakfast. It won't fall asleep.
And it has a little helper too. Here you are. Pick it up! Don't worry. It's not a substitute.
I should have listened to you. You were right. - I did not mean to do it-- - Shh, shh, shh. The work being done in this place is important, Eko.
- Four years? Not that I didn't check to see if she's published. You realize what this proof means, right? - Yes, if the math checks out. - I've been over it.
We have a zero-point module... which does what we're attempting on a smaller scale: Extract energy from subspace-time. - So subspace is real? - You're flying in it. Aren't you worried about the exotic particles crossing back over my bridge? That's the beauty of your theory.
Another band of stalwart heroes come to tempt fate in the hopes of claiming the legendary prize. - What do you know of the Sangraal? - Only what I have heard from legend. That it is located in a cave beyond the outlying forest, but that the journey there is fraught with peril. Ages ago, Morgan Le Fay enchanted the area with a terrible curse.
They brought a bunch of deaf people to see a ventriloquist! WHAT? ! What's do you do next? Go take on the blind folks to see David Copperfield. "The elephant disappeared"
What the hell is this? It's all perfectly legal. You'll find a signed executive order on file authorizing a secret jury of six men and women to try, sentence and execute people guilty of extraordinary crimes while collaborating with the enemy at a time of war. There's also a death warrant with my signature for every conviction. Your presidency is a farce.
No way! Can I see that one, please? Yeah, that's the Diamond Blossom. Yeah, the right hand diamond is very popular these days. All the stars are wearing it.
- I'm gonna tell him. - No, you're not. Then come up with a cunning plan and fast. She's not nearly as delightful as she thinks she is. What's this machine do?
- No, you're not. Then come up with a cunning plan and fast. She's not nearly as delightful as she thinks she is. What's this machine do? It makes a lot of noise.
Don't talk to me. Fine, but it's going to make collaboration kind of hard. Collaboration? I got men out here in harm's way, and you're giving press conferences. The press is a tool.
The Girlie Show. Hold on, I'll connect you. - Hey. - What's up? Hey, have you looked at that Cat Lady sketch?
No, I know. - I was just upset. Well, you had every right to be. That article was awful. It wasn't awful.
Just for two minutes, we could question the murder victims. That's exactly what she said. She was one of us, we trusted her, and now she's dead 'cause of that thing. The glove stays in the safe, where it belongs. These murders are happening because of Torchwood, so Torchwood has got to do something.
If my parents could see this. And I'm gonna blow it up. I noticed some anomalies in the solar radiation belt. I made an analysis of the star's vibration modes. Sure enough, it appears to be highly unstable.
I played a woman before. "Honky Grandma Be Trippin"' made $96 million. All I'm saying is, is drag is a way for Caucasians to emasculate you and make you seem nonthreatening. We never would have stopped so low on "Black Frasier." Niles, this Beaujolais is impeccable.
--Now, what about Mitchell Cafferty? --Why don't you let me handle that? Look, um... Johnston, I love this town. I just want to keep it safe.
Well, Mr. Mayor, let me just tell you what I found your wife doing. Jimmy, don't. Whoo... Well, suffice to say, her thong was in his mouth. Shut up!
Why? Because that would mean somebody's not only kidnapping Weevils, they're causing them pain. What can you feel? What do you know? I've tracked the van's route.
You can't help me either. It's okay. No, actually, my father did find a cure. It's called an Antibody. Unfortunately, we don't know where or what it is.
No! Hiro! You did it. You found the cure. Where was it?
And who is this? This is Djaq from the Holy Land, Your Majesty. Interesting. You're a long way from home, Djaq. Why did you choose this particular battle here?
He wants reinforcements. He wants more men. He still has got no idea. He has no idea what's happening in England. The message you sent with Carter.
I think it's better to have someone. Even if it hurts. Even if it's the most painful thing you have to do. Even if it's the most painful thing you've ever had to do. I think it's better to have someone. See this skin, O'Malley? It looks a little jagged.
Ivory-billed woodpecker. I'm sorry? Ivory-billed woodpecker-- that's what's getting me through this. I'm a,uh,lifelong birdwatcher. And when I get through this,I am finally going to scout the ivory-billed woodpecker.
Don't wait up. - The last of the ailing souls... - I told you to shut up! You know when you get a tune stuck in your head? This song just started coming to me.
- Nothing. T.J. put those up. Yeah, didn't want to tempt fate, huh? Well, you know, he means well. He also built this coat rack lamp.
Four-letter word rhymes with... "chut. " I suppose it could be worse. I could have an entire category named after me. That hairnet... has the Biggest Geekman award written all over it. Okay, Deichman's got a lock on that.
Have a good day, guys. Stephen, what is it? That was the office. The company was sold this morning. Sold?
Are the lives and dreams of the ordinary people of Chile, like the people of Venezuela, like the people of Bolivia, like the people of Nicaragua, like the people of Vietnam, and Iraq, and Iran, and Palestine, expendable - worth only a few seconds on the news if they're lucky? The answer is no, and those who see the world through the eyes of the powerful, should be warned. People are rising from the tyranny and oblivion to which we in the West have consigned them. Indeed, their resistance is well under way as this film has shown.
You must come to the fortress. I need you. Kal-El, save me. JOR-EL : Kal-El, the crystal you carry was made by Zor-El .
What? No, no! No, Mom. I like Raja now. This conversation is over.
Really? Candy-apple red. There's that radar detector he tried to hide under the dash. You remember it? He still owns it, what, 20 years from now?
The next time Leland left town? How did you know? The night we talked, you put the pen down on the table. I remember. It rolled a little. Yesterday in your bedroom, in your real bedroom, it didn't roll.
I need a lift to Cannes. I heard you got the last plane out of marquis and I've got to get Vinnie Chase and the Medellin crew there by tomorrow. Medellin... You know, I hear a lot of hype about that film. It's phenomenal.
I don't know if I can do this. Maybe you don't have to. - What... what is that? - It's a modified version of the memory neutralizer that I designed years ago. The original was like a shotgun, erasing short-term memory. This one erases long-term memory, but is much more precise.
That's not enough. Keep him overnight. Don't tell me how to practice medicine. I am not admitting a speed freak. Can you hold it down?
Why, you are nothing but an old man in a tent, sitting in rags, playing hoop-a-lou with the wind. - You wish for proof? - Aye. Pick... pick a card. Don't show me!
Aang, it's time you learned my history with Fire Lord Sozin. You need to understand how the war began if you want to know how to end it. Meet me on my home island on the day of the summer solstice. Ok, Roku. You need to know the story of your great-grandfather's demise.
Sensei? Why? He figured it would be impossible for him to ignore you once he hears your piano playing. He'll never accept that offer. I just got a message from your father saying he'd refused. I knew it.
Can't I take a message for you? Couldn't you put me through to them directly? No, we never put anyone through directly to the vehicles. What was the nature of the inquiry? Er... they were taking a letter up to Breidholt for me.
When did you make this? Just yesterday. I like the mask because it hides my face. I don't like you to hide your face. Take it off.
Before time began, there was the Cube.
And the one that rides the biggest wave wins. Are you nervous about going against Tank Evans? Ah, Tank. Nervous? What do I have to be nervous about?
I see a letter in your hands. To whom would I write, my dear? To Viscount de Prony, like you, to admonish him! This letter you see is neither from me, nor to me. It's for M. De Marigny, and was just handed to me.
If you really don't know, then you're better off. Safer. If I were you, I wouldn't be worrying about my safety. Huh. Well? The Transcoder... it's a unidirectional biological encoder. A what?
You need to come back tomorrow morning, 8 a.m., when we're open. Sergeant! Sergeant Mulanax! Sergeant, I just need to see one file! Just give me five minutes.
And I wanna show you one. - You're one of those guys? - Come here. Is this a pregnant superhero? I found it in Japan when I was there with my band.
What happened to you? I found the star. I can't believe you did it. Where's my star? Can I see it?
The human impacts what's happening with global warming, climate changes it is happening first and fastest in the Arctic. We're starting to see that things are happening even faster than what scientists indicated. By the end of the century, perhaps even in a few decades the Arctic will be quite ice-free. Well, climate change is going to have a strong, fundamental impact on the global water cycle. It's going to change rainfall patterns.
We wouldn't want that, would we? Let's just hope for the best, shall we? That should be enough. Take this. It's a standard torsion seismograph.
Well, you are the one holding the gun. Life is for living. It's there for the taking. Grant yourself no regrets. Go on, put it down. You don't have it in you.
Mum. We didn't hear you come home. This is Vlad. Plumber. Just popped in to fix the toilet.
I've been scared by a lot of things for a long time. She sacrificed me to protect her children. And sacrificed them to protect herself. Will the defendent please rise. We the jury find Gertrude Baniszewski guilty of first degree murder. Sentencing her to life in prison. The case got a lot of attention.
The last days were terrible. One month before the armistice, Iraq bombed Tehran every day as if to wipe it off the map. Towards the end, the regime got scared because an opposition army had entered from Iraq. The government feared the threat posed by political prisoners. The state adopted a radical solution to the problem.
You don't know the corporate world very well, do you, Doctor? - No, suppose I don't. - It's not going to work. I built I.S.T. I have a game plan.
Miss Crawford, this concerns you too. My dear, I have to ask you to be brave. I'm very sorry for it. Julia? Julia is safe with our cousins at Richmond. Last week, I received a letter from an old friend in London.
How do you know you're looking for a person? See, smart people remove themselves by a few degrees from inside trades... Sell through a company or a foundation, maybe. The Hadley foundation sold shares that day, Tyler. What's the Hadley foundation?
May I speak freely? You're about to implement another new strategy regardless of the human cost or the financial cost because you predict... We thought deeply about the human cost when we planned this strategy. What were your estimates? What I can say is that this strategy has patience and determination at its core.
It's gonna be okay, Stevie. Just inject the dye. Dye's going into his liver, but it's not coming out. The clot's gonna be constricting the flow in the hepatic vein. It's not constricting it.
It should pass on its own. Strong magnet. It's messin'with the imaging. We have no way to— You got X-ray vision, House? Oh, you gonna cut him open? Right here?
YOU KNOW WHAT THE WEIRDEST PART IS? I'M REALLY, REALLY... LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. YOU GOT MY MESSAGE. I DID,
Got a present for you too. SID found your finger prints on the Garza murder weapon, - just like you said. - Who else has seen this report? No one.
You were perfect-- two guys who had every reason to hate the government for what happened to your fathers. And you set us up. You don't know it,but I saved your lives at the drexler. did you get out? The bomb had a fail-safe.
- Put General Walsh through. - You're on with Bill Buchanan, sir. This is Walsh. General, we've made visual contact with a single drone. We're tracking it on satellite.
Get us away from it. Sir, the satellite is turning again. It's hitting the planet. It's a sustained beam. That is bad for a dozen different reasons.
I used to come up here every summer, helping Uncle Harvey run the place. It's all mine. It's my farm. I own a farm. I'm the farmer in the dell. - Get that tractor running.
- You were just being nice to Billy. - What do you mean? You didn't really like the movie, did you? I thought it was amazing. You didn't?
- Your Majesty. Mistress Anne. You are most welcome. I must thank Your Eminence for the magnificent brooch you sent me. I am so glad you liked it.
Infecting thousands. Of what do you speak, Papa? The disease of Lutheranism. It spreads among the poor. Those who see the church as rich and corrupt and decadent.
- Overruled. The man is an expert witness. We're entitled to hear his professional opinion. Thank you. Well, if it was human, it was nothing I'd ever seen before.
The man is an expert witness. We're entitled to hear his professional opinion. Thank you. Well, if it was human, it was nothing I'd ever seen before. Was it self-sustaining?
That is why we are wearing English uniforms. - What if we are not seen? - We'll leave English effects. - It's going to go well. - This is a limpet.
I had this bike accident when I was a kid, And I banged my head pretty good, And I haven't had a dream since. Till the study... uh, sort of. What'd the doc give you? It's this yellow tea. It smelled awful -- Tasted worse.
Dr. Prosky suggested that I free-associate. So here I go. You know what I think about when I pull a trigger? I think about the Infield Fly Rule. I love that fucking rule.
Ah. What's your specialty? Legs. I'm a leg doctor. Well, Doc, I love this truck. I do.
I know it may seem strange that I have feelings for an octopus monster from another universe. And yes, perhaps it's not the storybook romance that's been crammed down our throats by Hollywood. But the Monsterpus has loved us from afar since we were amoebas. Only when the space anomaly opened could it finally express a billion years of longing. Really?
before you die i will give you one last chance to explain yourself if this is destroyed tonight it can never be used again anywhere anytime give it to me i am the guardian of the formula You found him! yeah. It worked! The formula must be destroyed.
Understand she taught there. Yes, but I'm not at liberty to say-- of course. Silly of me. How is the old school? God, I miss it.
But it was eating him up. It's such a waste. Alex would have been a wonderful teacher. What part of "confidential source" don't you understand? What do you care where the tip came from?
Andy's was. - What computational error? you put the bishop on e6 to begin with! - You asked me to teach it chess- - I taught it chess.
"Listen," Kyle said. "Listen and understand. The machine is out there. It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with.
"Listen and understand. The machine is out there. It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear.
Yeah... good old Sam, back at the loft. You don't say. Yeah. I'm gonna go, mom. That store there...
You can't be serious. I wanted other things. I don't understand. Well, one day you're there... and then, all of a sudden... there's less of you, and you wonder where that part went, if it's living somewhere outside of you. And you keep thinking... maybe you'll get it back.
Thanks. How are you, Don? Henry. Sit down. Can I get you anything? You know, I'm glad you picked this place.
Because we want both, they want to be both. It's about how they want to be seen by us... their husbands, their boyfriends, their friends' husbands. Here's the idea, very simply. The bra is called the Harlequin. In fit and form, it should be your very best.
All right, just let me get my keys. Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God! The laundry is out of the hamper. Okay, Sheldon, what was it supposed to be? Fine.
I was turning over rocks, trying to get a bead on that son of a bitch. He just bought a second house in Catalina. And a new BMW, and look at this. He's got two offshore bank accounts on a Sheriff's salary. Randy, this guy is dirty. I can smell him. What is it? This one's been repainted. Recently.
Trippy. I like it. I was able to extract an undiluted sample from inside the needle shaft. And voilà, I give you the blue-ringed octopus. A what?
The teacher told me to clean the aquarium. That night I remembered that I hadn't turned on the pump. But I was too scared to sneak into the school at night. So I asked Donkey to turn the pump on for me. Donkey, please!
Can I have some water? Sure. Hang on a minute. Sorry about this. It's for my little patients, The elves.
- Yeah, that's the one. - Lovely. That's the printer there? - By the plant, yeah. - Brilliant.
- By the plant, yeah. - Brilliant. Does it need a code? Last place I worked, the printer needed a code. No, I can do it from here.
And evidently off-worlders, judging by your sonic technology. Oh, yes. I've still got your sonic pen. Nice. I like it.
Sorry. Desmond. Her name was naomi, and she claimed To be working for penny on a mission to find desmond. Oh, my god. I understand your helicopter crashed onto the island.
- No. But if I might beg the wisdom of the gods before we perish. Once this new race of creatures is complete, then what? My masters will follow the example of Rome itself, an almighty empire, bestriding the whole of civilisation! But if you've crashed, and you've got all this technology, why don't you just go home? The heaven of Pyrovillia is gone. What do you mean, gone?
My masters will follow the example of Rome itself, an almighty empire, bestriding the whole of civilisation! But if you've crashed, and you've got all this technology, why don't you just go home? The heaven of Pyrovillia is gone. What do you mean, gone? Where's it gone?
Listen, you do the creatures, I'll do the people. Deal? - What are these? - Heat-sensitive cameras. The creature knows this territory well.
Just do me a favor and go to the hologram room. Why? Just do it,please. All right,I'm here. Well,activate the hologram projector. There's no power.
You have nephroptosis. Also known as "floating kidney. " The kidney is like a chandelier. It's attached to a ceiling of intestines and blood vessels. But your contractor, I think you know who he is, he hung it with a cheap chain.
No, you won't. You're a security guard. Come on. That gun's just for show, innit? Do you know what a bullet does to a living person? It's not like a knife through butter, no, no, no, no.
You're good, I'll give you that. But I'm not! Yeah, and the Lone Ranger didn't have a thing with Tonto. Does the shape-shifter copy smells too? No.
Something you didn't want connected to the map at all. That is downright scary! Maybe you really do have a gift, kid. My bad for doubting it. Now, this key is also from Bouchard's stuff I found in Argentina.
Look behind you! Is there a cigarette? Yes. Get back there. Throw it out the window.
I, uh,... have to count the atoms at the nuclear plant. Conservation of mass. It's the law. The load is on the road. This episode's gonna be great.
Well, he's lost a lot of blood. Well, for what it's worth, the knitting group at St. Alma's added him to the prayer chain. Your mom knits? We all knit eventually. Listen, I just took a message for you.
Now, open the door and let her out. - This is Time Lord treachery. - Hey, the doorjust closed on its own! Nevertheless, the Tardis is a weapon. And it will be destroyed! What are you doing?
Nevertheless, the Tardis is a weapon. And it will be destroyed! What are you doing? Bring it back! - Doctor! - What've you done?
Did you call Ziva? Not answering, boss. Okay. So this one... No-brainer, easy to match. I've always really liked this color.
And all of the pieces are in place. Now it's up to you. If you really believe I have this thing why don't you just take it and do it yourself ? Apparently , the orb was built to protect the human race. So only a human can use it.
- I misinterpreted the rules. - I misinterpreted the rules. What the hell do you mean you just put my penis outside? Why didn't you call me? Look, Garrison, my wife didn't want a penis in the house. I had to get it out. Well, now how am I supposed to find it?
Of course, sure. Fine, so you're cops and morons. - Excuse me? No, no, we're very smart. The liver was not ripped out.
Forensics? On which case? The new bean counter is questioning this lab request. What is this key that you're testing? It's, uh...
I may have a car with clean paper. Today's your lucky day. See that Lexus? I need to unload that. Straight up trade, no questions asked.
Talk to John Henry. The Al communicates through images. Symbolistic responses. We thought about using a natural-language interface but decided against it. Too creepy.
In the near future, a computer system called Skynet takes over the world. It sends humanoid machines back in time to eliminate anyone who's a threat. I have a target list. Your name is on it. A machine is coming to kill you.
MORRIS: The van? EILEEN: It approaches from the left. We climb inside the van.
How copy? Solid copy, Godfather. Outstanding fire mission. Stand by. Listen, this town is just up the road.
- Camel killer. Look, I didn't mean to shoot innocent camels, all right? I'm sure I shot people. Shouldn't you two be doing the after-action report on Alpha's failedrecon mission? What's this about you losing your kevlar?
That's some kind of code for you,isn't it? Maybe I should take him. No,I'll take him. What's this? Look,it's been... very interesting working here,but... I'm a man of science, and this place is just...
This isn't about me. Maybe it is, Peter. You took the cylinder. Do you remember that? Yes, of course.
We're looking at our murder weapon. I'm gonna print this. Calleigh, I just got a hit off of the rigged cell phone from the Escalade. It's Sam Laughlin, the valet parker. We found this custom trailer at your place.
Maybe they just dealt with it better. No. It was new for grace. She was scared. She kept asking what a ghost could do.
I had thought that you were with us. As I am, as I am. But not enough to come out and say so. Politics is the art of the possible. What did you get by opposing the motion?
For what you did at school. I wanted to help you. Where's this bra from? It's new. Where did you get the money for it?
Well, it's an acquired taste, to be sure. - Um... You still going? - Absolutely. Something I love about the Snowflake Ball.
Jordan wasn't the only person in that bank. As for nate, I'm sure someone has told you that subarachnoid aneurysms are hereditary. It's nate or me, isn't it? You recused yourself from the position. You wanted to have a normal life again.Wish graed, but-- no--n-not nate.
That's great, but I'd like to do the scene As it was originally intended, as it's supposed to be. Actors and their words. I understand. You'll have your words. You'll do the scene as written?
It's not 100, it's 100 against 300. ##against? What does that mean, against? It means if the movie gets made you get another 200. If it gets made?
I had to get you back for ruining my bush. Well, I've known the guy for like six weeks now, the only genuine moment I've had with him is when he told me about a woman he never got over and a Mustang. That's why I was snooping around your house. I think you'd have better luck finding the Mustang. Why is that?
5.56 NATO ROUNDS... MIXED IN WITH SOME 9 MILLS FROM THE SUBMACHINE GUNS. INSURGENTS WOULD HAVE USED AK-47 WITH 7.62 AMMO -- HAS MORE OF A "CRACK." CONTRACTORS SHOT THEM UP, ALL RIGHT. YOU I.D.'d THE WEAPON FROM THE GUNSHOT SOUND.
MAYBE TWO. * OF YOUR NOVEMBER DOWNTOWN * I BOUGHT A PLANT. NICE. TEAM SPIRIT.
I had another dream. I see. I saw Arthur lying under water, drowning, and there was a woman standing over him, watching him die. And she's here. In Camelot. The mind plays tricks.
There is so much joy in this machine. Joy is not acceptable. Don't you see? My mind is stronger than you ever thought! It dominates, sir!
It doesn't make sense. Are we the bait, or is Grievous the bait? We must consider who this trap is for. General, your droid is tracking an incoming ship. It matches a description of General Grievous' fighter.
His entire estate, Swiss bank accounts, holdings, were nationalized. A clever SS accountant- well, I thought I was clever at the time- was put in charge. He was meticulous, which is how he rose so fast through the ranks. But this one file, he put aside. In fact, he stole it.
So why'd you call the marshals, detective? Well, we got two dead kids. We have a girl named sienna burke over there. And a boy with this in his wallet. And this.
Yeah. It was nice to meet you, Shmuel. And you, Bruno. Bye. Mum, I can't find my football.
Where'd you get this? It was Dad's. Yeah, I know. Where was it? I found it in the downstairs bathroom.
There's no leaving here. I have done nothing wrong. You invaded our airspace. That automaton that emerged from the sphere, it attacked our troops. It acted to defend me.
Guys! Guys! Guys! The blood trail ends here. What do you mean?
Shut up! Go. Asshole! You said you threw the gun out. -A good thing I didn't.
But for how long? Every day, human development takes a little more of their habitat. Soon, they may have nowhere left to live. The orca, or killer whale, is the king of the ocean. It is the largest of the dolphin family.
Okay. In a hostage situation, any idiot can steal a gun and start shooting. It's a great way to get a bunch of innocent people killed. Keeping people alive means fighting like a spy. Where is your data server?
Sorry for interrupting, senator. We have a subpoena for jack bauer. He's being questioned by the united states senate. We need mr. Bauer immediately. The cip firewall protects every major infrastructure system in this country.
Not yet,but they believe the CIP device is being utilized. We have to assume Dubaku is initiating another attack. - Madam President. - What is it,Tim? I've just been forwarded a scrambled call.
That is fantastic! Yes! Oh, look at that. I found the spoon. It's not silver.
So I can't ask you anything after all. Okay, anything except about the old man. Look... The peacock has the most beautiful feathers, the envy of all other birds. And it knows.
I-I'm pretty sure it was more than once. Ok? I'm holding this dead dog... and I look up. I see this liquor store across the street. I mean,it's glowing.
In case anything happened. Thank you. Dear Casey, it has fallen upon you to finish what began in Auschwitz. Be careful. The dybbuk feeds on fear. It has a taste for our family's blood now.
Oh, nothing! No! Nothing. All of this is free. This vase is free. It was, actually.
Jenny! It's an old map. A Speed. The poor dear didn't even know what it was. What a waste! It shouldn't spend its life on a wall in wherever the hell we were.
-Um, just... What are you doing? Will you marry me? What were you looking for? I thought I had a ring.
Yeah, well, you have to be careful. Sometimes they put you in the trunk of a car and you can't breathe. I'm not... I'm serious. I told him your theory about capital punishment. What did you say?
Oh. Who makes up these names? Mr. Massey names all his paints himself. Well, it's a beautiful color just the same. Oh, and doesn't it bring out the pearl in her skin? Right.
- Hey. - I fixed the garage door. - Great. Yeah. One track was bent.
Here. Cut up the last two sponges. Remember the electrolytes? Well, think about it. A battery is a galvanic cell.
I'm being rehabilitated. Aren't we rehabilitating? Just outside Paris, they spot the radar, slow down. All of a sudden, the car breaks down. It glides along a little.
I always had that impression. Don't talk anymore. You're wounded. The bullet went straight through. It doesn't count as a wound.
And this time, try not to leave the edges frayed. Hey, Edie! Wait up! Now don't forget, the clasp is broken. I'll replace it.
- No, excuse me. It's just that sometimes my thoughts come so fast that I get confused. Sorry. From now on, I'll say a line, and all you do is repeat it exactly. The film is impotent.
Do not try and force me to choose between my child-- I'm forcing you to do your job! If you can't also-- Fine, you want to separate a patient's central nervous system from the rest of his body. If the pain stays, it's in his brain.
You tell me I look great. I tell you you're a people person. How can you know the truth? You could ask for the truth. What do you think of my nose? Please tell me the truth.
Did you give him the money yet? I was right. And more satisfyingly, you were wrong. It was a coincidence. The cat was not predicting deaths.
S he never ever apologized. S he was like me. Alright. There's something we have to settle. While discussing important objects, I put Anne's marble on my desk.
Andrew Staines, Ellen Hunt, Michael Sanders, mean anything to you? No, nothing. We need to get inside Whitehall. Have you got the I5 software, Ianto? Yeah, it's still on the site, why?
Father, they are hunting for you. It is as I feared then. I beg you to hide the ring. Do not wear it! No.
The other one was Jenny May. We were trying to stop the traffic in Russian dolphins, and it involved a hunger strike. About the tenth day, I passed out, and I went to a hospital there, so Jenny became a target, and they followed her down the beach and strangled her with her own belt. These dolphins are symbolic of a new day for the environment. It's all about respect now, not exploitation. I feel somewhat responsible because it was the Flipper TV series that created this multi-billion-dollar industry.
It's unbelievable, really. Even though there's obviously no words spoken, you really feel like you're on some level communicating with them, like there's an understanding between the two of you. I don't normally touch anything in the water, but I just thought, you know, it had been swimming with me for so long, I put my hand out in front of me, and it rolled right into my hand, and it just stayed there in front of me, letting me rub its belly. Here you have this dolphin, wild and on its own terms, come up and really seek out affection and touch.
Gollum knows, doesn't he Gandalf? He knows the location of the Ring? Yes. Unfortunately our secret is no longer safe, the foolish Hobbit revealed his name. It should have been destroyed.
We were made in God's image. This body was made to resemble a particular human. This body appeared in Red Valley, New Mexico, in 1999. It had a different appearance then. In 2007 it kidnapped Dr. Alistair Fleming and forced him to regrow its organic covering.
It's not like a voice in my head. Someone came on the radio, said that the people that killed my sister were coming to kill me. I'm not crazy. Did you recognize the voice? No, I didn't.
Sir, please, can't we just bring him in here and ask him where he was the night his sister-in-law died? What do you mean, no one asked him that? No one has asked him anything. No one thought it mattered. In the past 24 hours, a theory of evidence has emerged.
No, we can't go that way. The door is locked, Michael. Stand back. This whole thing is falling apart. Is it?
Is sort of readily identifiable. I don't know your name. I'm kate. Jack. Did anybody see that? Yeah. E island is a mysterious place.
He killed Abin Sur? With a smile. [ARGUING IN ALIEN LANGUAGE] I don't have this place in my files. It's called Labella's.
- Breathe deep, your majesty. Good. - Lady mary. - Yes, madam. The box.
There's a very disturbing sequence where one of the actresses mutilates her sex with fragments of glass and then she shows it to her husband saying "no" to him. That's undoubtedly violent, but it belongs to art just like the paintings of Goya or some of Baudelaire's poems describing cooked fetuses eaten during some banquets. Art has no limits towards death. Even when in cinema an already dead animal is used to underline human cruelty. The movie received lukewarm reactions.
See, I said, "Is. " You heard me. Game over. I win. Have you even seen this show? Yeah, it was good.
- I want a quick word with you privately. - I'm in the middle of something. - It's very important. It's about your boat. - My boat? I don't have a boat.
such beautiful words you have just said of the soul and such I think I already like you very much Heinrich The philosophy of the people, my dear child does not serve to console the weak.
Thanks for making it easy on me. Actually, I understand he's a bit of a gun nut... which means he's less likely to call the cops and more likely... to just... shoot you. So good luck with that. You have a car repair kit? A tire iron is great if you need a new tire.
Any guesses what his plan might be? No. I don't know. I don't want to wait to find out. You know what the Talmud says? "If someone's coming to kill you, get up early, kill them first."
And besides that... it's not good for you. What is this ointment made from? Growth proteins. Antihistamines as well.
-Oh, bless him. He's doing that... -Yeah. MKOMBE: Guess who? Um...is it Mkombe?
After James Dean died, his mechanic bought the wreckage and he fixed it up. And it repaid him by falling on him. Then Tony McHenry was killed when it locked up on the racetrack. I mean, death follows this car around like exhaust. Nobody touches it and comes away in one piece.
Oh! Aah! Sorry. I think my arm is broken. Relax.
I-I-I didn't do anything. I have--I have to go to work. This is all your fault! You did this, the three of you! I can see the cone of power.
Technically a brain-computer interface, or BCI. This particular chip has a transmitter, which makes it wireless. So it can commit the brain to a remote computer? That's right. From what we can ascertain, we think it works a lot like a pacemaker.
Peter, he's plugged in. Let me try to shut down the program. November 822 to ATC, I've got a problem! I'm gonna have to try to disable the server. Can you shut it down?
What does she look like? Man, I'd like to see her face, too. Hey, wait! God damn it! I don't care!
Imagine that each letter had a number in this alphabet. A is one, b is two and so on. We can apply plus one. A becomes B, B becomes C. Then comes the hard part - and I've transferred it to this machine.
Not the whole thing, just one small piece. Then I'm not defiling a dead body. House. The last generous act of a living person. House, it's too late. The liver started to degrade.
I've been working on my new song. That's good! What's it called? It's called "What's The Point?" Sounds interesting.
You don't have a lab.You have a storage unit. Semantics. Thanks,moz. white collar Season01 Episode03 The bible belonged to the church of saint camillus de lellis in naples. It was brought here in 1903.
You're making me wonder if this pizza is worth the 22-hour drive. Just like old times! I feel so young again except for the chest pains. But the crust is so good. What is the secret to this crust? It's no big secret.
Because you don't have a choice. What is it that you wish to know? What is the Crystal of Neahtid? To those who know how to use it, the crystal holds great knowledge. What kind of knowledge? The knowledge of what is, what has been and what is yet to come.
You, you, you - don't move, I'll kick the shit out of you. Shut up! Where's the laptop? On the chair. Easy, calm down.
Oh no, the journey was very pleasant. I would like to introduce ambassador Snaut to you. Good day. This creature here is covered by a coral. It uses it as a protective cover and as a weapon.
I'll do something. I can't stand it any more. I'm afraid. I don't know what to do... I often have this dream.
Suddenly, I felt something hot come down on my head. I felt tingly all over like someone was poking me with needles. Then my boy said: "It feels hot right here, Mom." Then the cancer vanished.
The thing without which we could not exist. You're talking about the moment of creation. Yes. In a way, I am. The antimatter is suspended there in an airtight nanocomposite shell with electromagnets in each end. If it were to fall out of suspension and come in contact with matter say, the bottom of the canister, the two opposing forces would annihilate one another violently.
He's the prophet that predicted the annihilation of the earth. "Let angels guide thee on thy lofty quest." This is the first marker. The path is alive. Southwest.
No, now. Now, as in- - As in- - As in now? As in not now, as in right now. Shaw, the storage yard is halfway across town.
Frak me. - What? - You're not gonna believe this. Based on the co-ordinates we got from Sam... we've determined that the Cylon colony is located here. It's within ourjump range, but there's a sizable catch.
(Mai) Oh. But I can tell you a little. Okay. The Yasakani no Magatama was created By my ancestors. Almost 2,000 years ago. At that time, the necklace possessed... The energy to unlock the door.
Kyo is a half-breed. Iori, what is the Orochi? Really? What is it? You wouldn't understand. It's pure evil. Iori, you have to learn how to trust me.
Really? What is it? You wouldn't understand. It's pure evil. Iori, you have to learn how to trust me. It can give you great strength and power That's addictive and destructive.
Let there be light. Let there be honesty. Let there be no running from non-existent destroyers of morals. Let there be honest understanding. Gentleman, is the matter submitted?
Let there be honesty. Let there be no running from non-existent destroyers of morals. Let there be honest understanding. Gentleman, is the matter submitted? It is submitted, Your Honor.
The portal's gonna close. What? What is it? The moment Flynn is on the Grid, Clu will stop at nothing to obtain his disk. My disk is everything, Sam.
You go. Let's go up from here. Today's so clear we can see miles from here! Lift him up. This tubular pillar is crucial to the Buddha.

Our people are fighting and dying at home. You must join the FLN. The FLN supports the armed struggle. The FLN controls everything. It's organizing the resistance.
You don't say. Hands up! No, you misunderstand. I keep that gun for sentimental rea-- Don't shoot!
Are you a good one, a very famous one, or just married to a mafioso? - I'm single. - So, you must be a very good one. Congratulations. Show me your Arabian palace.
We're fine, Max.. We don't need anything. I brought a hot cucumber. What? I boiled it for two minutes.
They'll be very calm. Nature is cruel, but we don't have to be. We owe them some respect. I touched the first cow as it was being stunned. In a few seconds, it was gonna be just another piece of beef, but in that moment, it was still an individual.
They are the bread and butter of all valedictorians. And that is why you are not valedictorian. Jess doesn't need clichés. The speech is gonna be epic. Epic?
Oh, yeah, they're both gone now. Funnily enough, I was thinking about him on the way down. I looked out the windows when we were in Lincolnshire, I saw this fucking tree. It rem...
At the Two Pigeons Hotel. What's René's full name? René Fulcignoni. Ask a cat if tripe should be taxable. It doesn't know the answer.
Jack Shephard. hello, Mr. Shephard. Uh, this is oceanic airlines calling To inform you that we've, um, We've located your missing cargo. My father's coffin- you found it? Yes, sir.
Sorry? You haven't killed me. Clearly, there's something you want. I just want you to deliver a message, that's all. Then why didn't you just have Claire deliver it?
I mean, each robot would be unique and uncopyable. That's not really my point. See, my point is that a robot could benefit from being in the real world. You know, let it out, explore, get it out of the lab. Uncopyable.
Come over here. I got something I want to show you. This big enough to hold whatever you're hoping to ship to Gemenon? Yeah. That'll work. Look at the tag.
I was gonna turn the job down. But this guy's nuts. He's grade-"A" psycho. You would like him. This device - How's it set up? It's airtight.
You're needed downstairs, Agent Romeo. Wow, she seems really into you. Agent Miller has been working undercover for the CIA, playing the girlfriend of suspected arms smuggler, Karl Stromberg. We've learned ten million dollars was recently wired into Stromberg's account. We don't know what this weapon is, but someone's willing to pay a lot of money for it.
He's humping her? Oh, Daddy! I'd rather not know. In my opinion, it's a not new situation I found this. The bitch!
So those stars there go to France and become French. No. Stars travel abroad but they don't like it there. So they turn around the earth all day and return to Belgium at night, to sleep. What? I'm putting the moon inside.
Alice... Have you seen my gun? Somewhere.
- Call me. This rock ... This rock has been waiting for me my entire life. I hate this rock! It's entire life.
What aboutthe rabbit? A rabbit fora kickboard. The rabbit... No can do. I have this machine. What's that?
Such is our imperfect nature that dissipation may prove more efficacious than reflection. (Organ playing) # Rock of Ages cleft for me How did you find the sermon, Aunt? I fear I slept through most of it.
SATINE: War is intolerable! We have been deceived into thinking that we must be a part of it. I say the moment we committed to fighting, we already lost. Excuse me, Your Grace, are you suggesting we oppose the war on humanitarian grounds?
Nobody's supposed to make way. It's hard to believe he was ever this little. Three years is a long time. You don't like the vacuum sweeper? It just makes such a racket.
This is a receipt from the airport bar for 7 scotches. Drinking keeps me warm and approchable. Oh here. It's a map. My mentor who ran this place before me left it to me in his will.
I don't like that memo anymore either. Way too many people are having fun with my name. I'm surprised it took this memo to get that train out of the station. Look, I've had several complaints, but the company is not going to admit it made a mistake. What if it didn't have to admit it made a mistake?
-Don 't fucking piss me offi. -Stupid idiot. We're almost there. Shit, fucking road. I'll fuck up my car. I hope it's worth it.
Yes... these are God's children. But they have lost their way. And we cannot simply award this deviant path by allowing them the sacred sacrament of marriage. And they think if they can twist enough arms in the political arena that they can win this... prize. But marriage isn't a prize, is it?
Oh, I'll be leaving these woods... Ah! ...but you won't. [GRUNTS] Look, the legend of Siobhan McDougal is just a ghost story.
You smell like lemongrass. - My shoes? - No, your body odor. The soap is old-style. Good.
Is that MacManus? M-a-c? Yeah, just try all the variations. They always mess it up. Oh. They're calling this operation olive branch. H-hour is midnight.
Whatever magic allowed you to pass through this rock is beyond my powers. If you can't get in, what about the spell of taking? It doesn't work on living things. I can't use it to get you out of the valley. No, but you once used it to take the Sword and compass from me.
Larry, did you call the cops? Oh, shit! I'll call an ambulance! I told you three times today that the screen pass was a bad idea. It wasn't working!
I've got to go. Come on. Wait. Oh, I found your mustache. Where was it?
She got like that toward the... end. Got obsessive about stuff. Just got mad about stuff. We didn't know what was up. It wasn't like her to be that way. But it turned out that the cancer had spread to her brain and that was why.
Get him out of here. The rest of us are trying to build something. He's right. Where would you hide a coin? You'd spend it, wouldn't you?
Yes, Your Ladyship. Yes? I saw this advertisement for a limp corrector. Yes? What does it do, exactly?
How else could she have ended up here, with a man she despised? Good morning. - How long have you been sitting there? - For a while. I've been admiring your scar.
Where the hell is the dog? Who is it? It's our neighbor. The dog is gone. Maybe it ran away.
Thank -- thank you. Since when do you call me your life partner? Since a spot opened up at billingsley academy. But I liked wagon wheel. It had all the duckies.
If you two would like to take a seat, I will let mr. Plympton know that you're here. Thank you. Yes, thank you. this place is amazing! I told you.
There's something else you need to know. Atlanta isn't what we thought. It's not what they promised. The city is... Do not enter the city.
Initial analysis of the powdered bone dust revealed traces of blastomyces dermatitidis. It's a fascinating fungus that quite literally eats bone. So that's what happened to the rest of his skeleton? A fungus ate it? Where'd the fungus come from?
Of course... mom. We just got the results back from the second bubble we found in the chocolate. You mean the eructation. This one wasn't a burp. It was her final exhalation.
What? [GRUNTING] "And would that I might endure his agony, as well as mine." The Scarlet Letter. Of course, the letter is a mark of shame.
[WHOOSH] CLARK: Oliver. So Clark Luthor is the mysterious Ultraman of Metropolis. That name sucks, by the way.
Three weeks ago I was on this rooftop and I opened a portal using the Book of Rao. If the darkness came through a gateway, maybe it can leave through one. I've used my bracelet before to open a portal. This dark force is like a disease. How did it become so powerful?
I've used my bracelet before to open a portal. This dark force is like a disease. How did it become so powerful? It can see your thoughts and feelings. It can find the one morsel of doubt that even the purest person doesn't realize they have inside them.
Take him away in Euro-cuffs. Wait! Not so fast! We found something to save Krusty! And it's on this DVD.
Should be back to the boat in about 10. Be careful. We found the container. And what was in it? Nothing.
I want you two to cover the other end of the case. Agent Williams was investigating a rebel group in Chechnya. He suspected they were buying small arms from a corrupt source inside the Navy. And how far are we away from fixing that file that Williams sent from his PDA? Uh, we're moving slowly but surely.
It's a risk we're going to have to take. Works for me. Not you. Just like old times. The service road from the south is the likeliest entry point.
Break it down. Window, screen wall. Bedroom, bathroom. Even if we get eyes in... The front door opens the wrong way.
- Good night. MRS. LOCKWOOD: It's good for Tyler to have you in the house. - I appreciate that, Carol. - Hmm. Oh, and I can see if I can dig up that stone you're looking for.
- No, what about the moonstone? What do you know about the moonstone? I know that you need it. And I know where it is. - Yes? - I can help you get it.
You don't have much time. There's a lump of plastic that used to be a laptop. Somebody definitely set up shop here. I got a resin mold here. Looks like the guy tried to destroy it before he took off.
If you looked at the costs of it: the structure of equity welth, of housing wealth... then the structure of income, of jobs, 15 million people globally... could end up below the poverty line again. This is just a hugely, hugely expensive crisis. This crisis was not an accident.
Grandmother said, "Child, you will see the man you love under water." I had a big brother too. They shot him. The murderer is still a free man.
Take his weapon. There can only be one commander, And Kiva's dead. Any objections? What do we know about the planet? Not much.
There they go. Honey was considered so sacred as a gift from the bees. The honey was not sold until the end of the 19th or into the 20th century. Most of the honey was given away as a gift. It is one of the most beneficial and healing substances that we can imagine.
First we had to iron out a few details. "Roommates agree that Friday nights shall be reserved "for watching Joss Whedon's brilliant new series Firefly." Does that really need to be in the agreement? We might as well settle it now;
She seemed to like the last one, too. So you played baseball as a boy. Do you still have your mitt? What? No.
Who is he? Your groom, Thomas Culpepper. So far, both of them have denied the charges, though neither of them denies the many illicit meetings they had on the backstairs and in the Queen's stool closet during Your Majesty's last progress. Lady Rochford and other maids of Her Majesty have come forward with corroborating evidence of their frequent intimacies. Finally, this letter was discovered in Mr. Culpepper's chambers.
Really, it's gonna be fine. I'm all over it. Chance is all over it. We're both professionals. Yo! You want to, uh, grab my battery?
So, we heading to the Bureau? I got the FBI on board with Caffrey, but you? I don't even know your real name. And I've looked. Thanks for the pen, by the way. What pen? I got...
He found a trace of semen inside the victim's vagina and a finger print which he missed out in his initial autopsy. What does that mean? He said there was no evidence of rape... Even if there was semen, doesn't it belong to Lee? The blood-type of the semen's donor is the rare RH-A type.
And I want to be close to you. Grubbs is on tour, right? So you need a bartender. Alex, your movie just blew up. At the festival.
I thought he'd pick you. - Yeah, me too. Although I kind of panicked and thought it might be you. That pie smells really good. It is really good.
- Yes, I know. Here, the line across the man's eyes, it's the Chinese number one. And this one is 15. But what's the code? All the smugglers know it.
Where's Cafe Diem? Shut up. And then Henry's garage. G.D. Was the last place hit. We've been thinking about this all wrong. The weapon isn't the source of the events.
I'll try not to disappoint you. Diana, I can't thank you enough. You will always have a home here. Alura. You once asked if I could remember my mother's name.
And I see you didn't get a chance to clean your shoes either, huh? - That's not why I went there. - Really? ! So you didn't go back to the memorial to finish up Toby's handiwork? Or were you just there covering up his tracks? I found it like that.
Say hello to the brand-new Italian reading lamp that you've always wanted. What's wrong with my old lamp? I just... I bought that three weeks ago. You discovered it at a flea market. Do you like it?
Royce made his billions in shipping and mining, not arms. Maybe we should notify NSA. I'll brief them. We have to act quickly. Surveilling this conference is gonna be difficult.
That dick is a magic marker. Hooman has a crayon. I took him to the baths. That rude asshole never even took off his Bluetooth. No, no, you're not accounting for edema.
The messy-haired mug shot you. Well, I don't know. I thought it was such a great idea For you to go live with your grandfather. Yeah, don't buy back the sale here, burke. But I completely understand your decision.
They think they have a reason, but they're wrong. Five minutes with you and the pope would find a reason. I told you, okay? I didn't steal anything. I was hired to deliver a box... as specified, unopened.
Put all this shit in that skip. Would it kill you to dress it up a bit? Put all this shit in that skip, please. Sometimes I wonder if you take this job entirelyseriously. I'm 1 00% committed to your ongoing rehabilitation.
Hell no. I'm just getting started. Sweet. What the hell was that? Why was she wearing the suit?
Sweet. What the hell was that? Why was she wearing the suit? It must have slipped onto her at some point. Probably looking for safe harbor.
Something made me turn back, and there was a car coming straight at me. Did you see the driver? The headlights were in my eyes. How about the car? Could you make out the model or make?
Not any more. How can I avoid having enemies? Tomorrow you'll hold court for the first time. What should you do? Tu'an Gu. Yes. What is this virtue they call benevolence?
How can I avoid having enemies? Tomorrow you'll hold court for the first time. What should you do? Tu'an Gu. Yes. What is this virtue they call benevolence? It's one of the highest moral virtues.
Phone the neighbours. Wake the kids. Kick the dog. Remember that muddy female boot print outside Tilden's house? Yeah, we found it.
- No. He'll know someone was here. This is just a fact-finding mission. I think we know what the facts are. There's a way to do this. It protects you.
Happy? Katie, none of that is important. I hope you never have to worry about any of it. I'm sorry for what I may have to do, and for what you may one day discover about me. Commit this address to memory.
So, what do you think, copycat? Yeah, maybe one of his crazy fans. When Reed got off the prison bus, you notice him carrying a duffel bag or a box or anything? No. I mean, if he got fan mail in the joint, left it behind, where do you think it would be?
I wrote down the whole story of the day you were born. That's the gift I had to wrap. Really? Yeah. You can read it if you want now.
A cluster of pervs? That rules out areas that are near schools and parks. Housing options are limited, to say the least. Guess that makes sense. The cluster would be the one place they feel safe. Garcia, what's the address?
We'll get there. So you really thought I was gonna kill you? Well... ish. Oh, Ted, that's ridiculous. If I wanted to kill you, I'd invite you to my hunting lodge.
Here's the deal. I was in a situation, gallivanting through the forest. I came across your tower and... Where is my satchel? I've hidden it. Somewhere you'll never find it.
Mystical devices? Do you remember, after the battle, you stopped Tus from taking the dagger I'd won? That dagger is the reason he invaded Alamut. This dagger, you have it with you? Yes.
An honor guard. Young men who look good on a reviewing stand and old soldiers, heading towards retirement. Do you know what the Kraken is? The Kraken is the end of us. A colossal, elemental beast.
You know, I don't do that. I completely sensed that, yeah. So... I just wanted to clear the air. The air is cleared.
The second emperor of the Han dynasty locked his least-favorite wife in this urn for 10 years to the day. They say you open it up, the same thing will happen to you. I'm sorry. I'm looking for this note. Have you seen it?
I'm sorry. I'm looking for this note. Have you seen it? It kind of just blew into your store. A note?
Yeah, I prefer to go more by instinct. You know, what feels right. Very good. Well, the Parasite Spell is a rather nasty piece of business. It originated in Haiti, if memory serves.
I passionately believe it's the growth of small businesses into larger ones... that is critical for Britain's future. It has to be something icy on a stick for Denis. That's the only way... we will produce jobs, real jobs, jobs that sustain. The Trade Union Movement was founded to protect workers. Now it persecutes them.
Is this ship a threat? Both of these ships are carrying Exocet missiles, Prime Minister. Just yesterday... they launched, then aborted an attack inside the exclusion zone. There is a risk they could try it again. The Belgrano is sailing directly away from the islands.
Why? I'm sick of screwing in the open air. This tiger wants a bed. Don't you like it? You're hurting me.
- Yes, it's a Chintoko. - Really? - There's only five in the entire world. Sit, sit, sit. - Yeah, okay. - I love it.
Sire? Sire? Your engineer, sire. The mine is ready. Will it work?
- Yes, Father. Using the cross to incite hatred and anger- that's Christian? Well, maybe not. But, Father, the government is openly attacking the church. No, it isn't.
- Let's saw something else in half. - How about your finger? My finger? It's okay, the saw has a safety device. It detects moisture.
No! Unh. Ow! [NAOMI CHUCKLES] So this must be a fun job.
If you love her you'll let her go. We've all seen the bones on the trail to Mount Grimmoor. That's where the wolf makes its lair. BARKEEP: We know the weaknesses of the werewolf.
- Hello... - Hello? Yeah. Are you sure it's not unplugged again? you don't wanna cancel your policy.
- I didn't realise it was German. do you think I'm stupid? Look at me. Look at me. Why would I have bothered to take this thing? What am I supposed to do with it?
My parents' murder, everything we have been through, it's all about a damn list. - What list? - A list of names my father stole. This guy Kozlow came after me, thinking he'd force my father to give it back. The crazy part is I have had it all along and didn't even realize it.
That's real. The air in my lungs. Those bastards out there in the dark stalking us. It's this world that I'm worried about, Talget, not the next. What about your faith? What about it?
- And you? Only by rewards. We can go to a site, where can think a little. Who wants to fight? I hope that the row with Paul was not something serious.
How's this? "Dear Claire, I can't work the bake sale because you're a bossy control freak who look down..." Very funny, Jay. Ay... ay... why the whoosh? Where is... where is the e-mail?
Make it come back. I don't know how to make it come back. Now she's gonna read it, and she's gonna think it's from me! Well, technically, it was from you. But come on, let's hit the road.
You know, maybe there's a number we can call. - Whoa. CLARK: Chloe, look. I got a text message from last night. And it's from Lois.
And here are the targets. And here is a tracking history. How long does the residue last? A few months, a few days. We give the residue the half-life we want.
Anger isn't the answer. Loneliness isn't the answer either. Perhaps fear... Show you a movie. It's one of my favorites.
Loneliness isn't the answer either. Perhaps fear... Show you a movie. It's one of my favorites. It's called Jaws.
I mean, he's right there. Don't even try to tell me you're on an emergency ibuprofen run. I'm not sick. The slap was a nice touch... Oscar-worthy.
It'll be gone as fast as I can sneeze, hurl, and squirt it out. No, it won't. The common cold died out 500 years ago, and subsequently, humanity lost all resistance to its ravages, but the virus survived in you, frozen for a thousand years. Huh, so it was hiding deep down inside of me, like my skeleton bones? Give it to us straight, Professor.
The common cold died out 500 years ago, and subsequently, humanity lost all resistance to its ravages, but the virus survived in you, frozen for a thousand years. Huh, so it was hiding deep down inside of me, like my skeleton bones? Give it to us straight, Professor. How incredibly deadly is it? We don't know.
Isn't a carnival a good idea? Bakhtin... You think I could have done such a thing to you? Right, but it was thanks to Bakhtin that I cooked it up. He demonstrated how the carnival is liberating.
Make it up. More. What does that mean? It means my tongue comes towards you. Slowly. It slithers across the floor.
More. What does that mean? It means my tongue comes towards you. Slowly. It slithers across the floor. It slips under the bed. It rises up the side of it.
What does that mean? It means my tongue comes towards you. Slowly. It slithers across the floor. It slips under the bed. It rises up the side of it. It reaches your feet. It licks them.
I mean, she wasn't young, but still... Thank you for telling me, Denise. I know, baby. That smell never went away. It came with the car.
Hoyt, we need to talk. I found this fuckin' doll on the bed again. I thought you said you got rid of it. I did. I threw it in the lake.
Please bring Miss Lane's car inside and repair any damage from the flight. That key can't be safe. Why don't you give it a try? [LOIS GROANS] I carved it out of a piece of dwarf star material.
Paul had no choice but to punish his wife... I love you. Because some lies... are unforgiveable. We are reminded every spring... with every rose that blooms, with every sunflower that blossoms, with every lily that buds. The world is a beautiful place.
I hope it cheers him up. I'm sure it's just what the doctor ordered. Well, I wish I could do more. Oh, Susan, you're doing more for Paul than you can possibly know. The Grand Canyon.
I don't really wanna talk about her. So, what happened to you? What's your story? It's complicated. It's complicated or you just don't wanna talk about it?
You know, I'd appreciate it if you'd replenish my supply when you diminish it. I'm wallowing. Word on the street is you went to Randy Morosco for information. Well, a unique black-market pigeon blood recently made its way to New York, and none of the local shops have anything like it. No one would try to sell a stone like that without cutting it first.
Must have been some kind of power surge. Is it still transferring? I don't know. The mainframe is inaccessible. Anything?
As you requested, Mother. [SOFT PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] I first heard this music on Earth. No, I didn't hear it. I felt it. I carried it around in my head.
Ryan, you do have a soul. - How do you know that? - You wouldn't feel this way if you didn't. The soul is what lies beneath. It is the core of all humans.
Hanshiro. Please forgive me. Do not say such things. Please open the door. I'd like to see the fortress.
Well, maybe he was afraid people heard them fighting, so he took off. Plus he was shot, just wanted to get out, treat his wound. You own a green BMW? Yeah. Why?
Have you ever heard of a boy named Nick Baldwin? Congratulations. A colleague of mine just told me something that I never knew before. There is no such thing as a bonsai tree seed. Instead, you take the seed of a healthy tree and infect it with a fungus that genetically alters it's root system.
How many sons sprang from your father's cock? Five, Domina. And from his father before him? The same. Your subligaria.
And what would brave Solonius do in my fucking position? ! Turn blind eye towards the murder of his father? ! He would be certain to strike appropriate target. What if Tullius had no hand in this? His gift of wine was tainted with death.
Elian is an angry child, but he would not do this. Please, let me find him before it gets worse. Thank you for your help. Your head is spinning because it's full of ghosts. You think you can do this work day in, day out and you don't carry it with you?
They fit the bill. No one will care if they go missing, plus they're neck-deep in debt. Show me the cargo. It's already loaded. Hey, hey, hey.
We're done here. Okay, you don't have to hold back anymore. You may now say what you really think of Zoey. I don't know, she may have been right about that lion's head. It gave The Arcadian a regal elegance.
[SHOVEL digging] Tell me where you buried the blanket!
As one should approach you, perhaps? He is learning to mean what he says! But as to war, see here. My new invention. If it works, it will be... truly grisly.
-... Gloria Patri... You will fight like dogs over this corpse I leave for this throne of St. Peter's. But it was pure once. We have all sullied it with our greed and lechery. Which of you... will wash it clean?
Come on, damn you! Yes! To the victor, the spoils. Did you plant that tree? Steady on.
Are you? - Can we stop for a minute? - Don't tell me you're tired. I'm not tired. I'm hot . This tweed is too thick.
Make it look unsafe so the humans turn against Concordia. You must stop them. Why? Blue Energy has two forms. In its stable form it powers reactors.
There's an ongoing charge, not assigned to an active op or agent. It's a shipping container. Protocol for a cleaner in a foreign theater is to establish a storage space. Shipping container is a default option. Container A-541.
This, is the backbreaking work we've been doing, while you were getting takeout from your stupid Chinese bank! Every single one of these has to be wiped, reformatted, the whole shmeel. What? But it's just a little cartoon pirate! Was.
And my Vombrator. "Vombrator", what's that? My Vombrator... is this! A 100% French tractor! Those English pieces of junk don't even have a patch on it. Sadly, it's given up the ghost.
And they don't have a fly half... And sir here could do it. Oh no... Oh yes. A rugby team... is like the Foreign Legion.
- The woman was Kira Solari, right? - I think so, yeah. - Was it on TV? - No, no, no... Not here.
And all the time in the world to make them come true. The night Brother Sam carried Nick from his apartment... Nick fired a shot at him. From the couch, I'm guessing, since he was stoned. So the bullet should be here. 9 millimeter.
Does it make you feel better to kill bad people? It's part of the ritual. You don't need a justification to kill. The code is more than that. It's kept me from getting caught.
Not here. Things would've been good if we hadn't had you. If you weren't around... I spent so much money on you! I could've sold this shack...
Things would've been good if we hadn't had you. If you weren't around... I spent so much money on you! I could've sold this shack... It's Mom's.
Come on. Work, damn it work! Have we a problem? Come on! The worm!
State of the art. And semi-portable. Gateway computer. I haven't seen one of these in a while. Still works great.
Not a chance. You don't want to miss your plane. Right. If you're still sitting in the box, then you will be serving on this jury. Now, I can see this trial going one of two ways.
- Or a full-time valet. - What the hell is this? Melody said you weren't in school and now I know why. - John: It's a gift, Regina. - Oh, this is going back.
We're done here. I don't take to extortion. I'm not going to be bullied by an ambulance chaser, no matter how nice the suit. It is nice, isn't it? Italian.
If you would have stopped talking and just gotten on your knees, I probably would have said yes, but.. Stop, please. I forgive you. You do? So that means you're willing to give me another shot?
-What's this about? -l'm getting married. -Shut up. -Really. This ring is pretty amazing.
Previously on "the Vampire Diaries"... The only thing stronger than your craving for blood is your love for this one girl. Your humanity is killing you. Turn it off. No!
Yes, yes. It is, if what you're saying is true. It is, and all you have to do is sign on the dotted line. What a lovely quill! Wherever did you get it?
Like what? Avatar. It's a movie? Okay, okay, so there's this guy in a wheelchair, and he goes to this alien planet to join a program... So you pick a dragon and get to keep it forever?
Hey, honey. Dad, there's some freaky dude at the door screaming about money. I think he might be one of your patients. I don't know, should I call the cops? No. Just... just keep the door closed.
You'd risk Michael's life for that? Michael will be fine until I get up there and I break him out. Maybe I wasn't clear before. When I said I had Michael, I meant it. Right now, a predator drone is circling the compound.
I don't know why I'm quoting a rapist. Can't we just stay a little bit longer? We don't have any A.C. at home. I have an A.C. you girls can use. You have an air conditioner that works?
- Why'd you bring us here? - I need you to do a job for me. We've been tracking a computer super virus named the "Omen." Bring it back to me, Mr. Casey goes free. The virus is too dangerous to be released into the world!
It says she was tear-gassed and possibly beaten. I haven't been tear-gassed in so long. Well, you're on a new path now. Oh, goody, a new path. Is it lined with credit cards and flat screen TVs?
Aya... I'm so sorry. I couldn't save you. You were the one, who saved me. My body...
Okay. The internal iliac's retracted. I need to stop the bleeding. We're gonna have to clamp the vascular supply proximally. There's too much blood. I need you to clear the field. Damn it.
It's too risky. If we go outside of the track, we could hit healthy brain tissue. Come on. Take the probe. Hold it still.
You'll see it all the time in places like prisons or asylums. Negative energy feeds on trauma and pain. It draws those things to it. The force here in this house is larger than the many individual traumas. And it has a need.
Negative energy feeds on trauma and pain. It draws those things to it. The force here in this house is larger than the many individual traumas. And it has a need. It wants to break through.
It draws those things to it. The force here in this house is larger than the many individual traumas. And it has a need. It wants to break through. It wants to move in our world.
What the hell are you talking about? When a new Pope has been chosen... and the bells of St. Peter's chime he is shown into a small chamber next to the Sistine Chapel. They call it the Room of Tears, named for the sublime mixture of joy and sorrow that he must contemplate at this moment. He is brought a key to this box. It has been said that this box contains the ultimate secret.
Before we divulge any information, we have to know who we're talking to. How'd he die? Gun, knife, beaten to death? We're still trying to determine that. Well, you can't tell by looking at hi we wanna see the body.
That said, I do know a 3-year-old boy that once met a friendly apparition named Leverett Saltonstall. - He was nice? - Very nice. You'd think the laundry room would be closer to the dorms. It's not in the basement?
But what Greendale has always needed is a miracle. This is it. This is how I get to put Greendale on the map. You know, I thought this commercial was going to be okay. Well, guess what?
It can't go on like this. What would you have instead? You shouldn't laugh. It's no laughing matter. But there's no need for you to take it all as a tragedy. This place is unbelievable.
Find owen. He's on the trail of another black box. Anti-inflammatories. We needed the data on that box. You shouldn't have destroyed it.
I want you to have this. Half a million dollars? I have a favor to ask you. The past is a tricky thing. Sometimes it's etched in stone.
Daniel? Charlotte. Daddy,I can't live with her anymore. It's okay. this seat taken?
- Then what is? To enter into their game. I have the advantage over my adversaries in that I know what cards they hold whereas they are oblivious to my hand. Do you see this spider's web? Big, isn't it?
France's High Commissioner to Indochina, spoke confidently to Vietnamese students. Be a man! If you're a communist, join the Viet Minh. There are men there who fight hard for a bad cause. But if you're a patriot, fight for your country. This war is your war.
Thanks very much. You're my best friend. You're my only friend, Margeir. Won't you put a candle on it? Of course.
Come on. Is there no one who will play matrak with me? I won't take too much of your money. Neither the light of the sun nor the shining night stars ease my bleeding heart. How many times has the crescent moon become the full moon. But you are still not here. The marble balcony is cold.
I won't take too much of your money. Neither the light of the sun nor the shining night stars ease my bleeding heart. How many times has the crescent moon become the full moon. But you are still not here. The marble balcony is cold. It is dark.
Is it possible? Returning is not a skill it is a necessity, İbrahim. You are beautiful, my Sultan. You dazzle my eyes. Is the table ready?
Ta-da! Benny. What do you think, Lady B? This baby is fully equipped. Equipped for what?
No, no, I'm a naval man myself. I never fly if I can help it. He's got me confused with someone else. What is this peculiar liquid? There's no bouquet.
Can you see a face? A uniform? A flag? No. Our world is not more transparent now. It's more opaque.
These men are ruthless and vicious. Give me my sword and I'll leave this place. And go where? Anywhere my hands won't be used to make tools that kill anyone. This place is not so bad.
This has nothing to do with my original logo. My logo was an eye that was watching over the neighborhood. I don't know what this is. A tiger with wings? Exactly. This is a tiger, who's fierce and sleek. But it's got wings, so it flies above the neighborhood.
You tried to hang me with your belt! You told me to! No! You told me to! Look at my neck!
It's just that no one ever sees you. That's a beautiful necklace. Reminds me of one that belonged to my mother. It can't be the same one because her pearls are in this safe the manufacturer clearly explained is uncrackable. Oops.
I want to be sure we're still working towards - I think I may just have found the painting your wife craves. The rarest Winslow Homer the world has yet to see. I have it at home in storage. I came across it under the most unusual circumstances.
Oh, son of a bitch! You know what, I gotta go. Give Dad a kiss? Okay. My cactus. It's dead. So we'll return it.
That's the first thing I remember. It was dark, and it was cold. And I was scared. But then, then I saw the moon. It was so big and it was so bright.
It was dark, and it was cold. And I was scared. But then, then I saw the moon. It was so big and it was so bright. It seemed to chase the darkness away.
It's a swimsuit! Mud tracked all over your floor by uninvited guests? Well, the Thneed sure comes in handy for that! But wait, there's more! Thanks to its all-natural microfibers, the Thneed is super-absorbent!
Yeah? I'm sorry, love. I'm Camilla. Noel. So what sort of a business did your mum have then, Noel?
If every infected person fed on or infected the rest of the people, the entire population would've eaten itself off the planet long before Christ was even born. Only a stem can turn someone. Is that the sweater Tepish knit you? Mm-hmm. It would be impolite not to wear it.
A cat used to come to our garden. One day, I took the quail from its cage. I gave it to the cat. It carried it off to a corner to eat it in peace. I followed it. But the cat turned on me.
You reinstate me as Head of Nuclear Research, so I can finish building my bomb. Deal. One last thing. You will let me build a round nuclear weapon. Never.
Zoey thinks I'm at yoga. I have great news. We are just days away from testing the new missiles. I have re-engineered the oxidizing ducts and the payload delivery systems. But you'll be happy to know, the missile is now pointy!
You are powerful! Is there anybody better? No! Thank you, Scott. Your donation was more than generous.
Stop. What? And I don't even have a uterus. I mean, I have it. It's in a jar.
Probably able to adjust. But you should have figured out by now, you don't choose the Soy Sauce. The Soy Sauce chooses you. The Soy Sauce chooses you. If it can't use you, it kills you.
Are you confirming? That little bitch. Do you have my ring? Well, may I have it? Pretty.
It was a couple of hours after the sun went down. It's time. Oh, my God. There was a bone. A forearm, I think. Maybe it was a shin.
We're Facebook friends. Oh, my God! How do I eject? Why do you have flames on your laptop? It's a gaming laptop.
You don't have to do anything by yourself either. Dr. Ling was right. I didn't wanna listen to him at first, but I see what he means now. You're turning evil. There is nothing evil about wanting more. There's nothing evil about that teapot.
Tomorrow a raid at the gypsies. Case solved. According to witnesses, I can find Barberis... Not bad for an office guy, huh? Sorry, not just the head works...
This isn't about me. Do you realize how many people will get hurt if this gets out? You need to go. You've already complicated things enough by being here. This whole thing was supposed to go off without a hitch.
Could I perhaps sleep through it? If Your Highness puts wax his ears. The fever returns? It never leaves us, Catherina Sforza. But the smell of battle will be its own medicine.
You helped me with my fertility situation even though you didn't have to. And this is seriously the best night I've had in ages. The movie, the wine, no coasters. And this pizza is incredible. It's frozen from the Dixie Stop.
Listen, I got something that smells like you boys. A body turned up in Canton, Ohio. Local P.D.'s trying to bury the story and the body. Okay, um, so, uh, what's up with the body? Well, when it went missing, it was a perfectly normal grad student named Charles Durbin.
Thanks to you, I went on a soul-searching journey. I hate those! Now, give up the free will. I should have destroyed it, but I was too damn proud of myself. So I kept it around, never letting it out of my sight.
And that idea is called the anthropic principle, That everything happened just so that we could know it happened, But there's a problem with the anthropic principle. Ashley... What could be wrong with this idea? It assumes we're the end. Yes.
Oh, there's some sort of crosstalk interference. Only one other thing uses the same Gaussian wave packets. Oh. Let me guess. The missing control unit. I had this happen! I had this happen once with a garage door opener.
What the fuck was that? They're here... The aliens. Has anyone ever seen the sky like that? No.
Ji Ben, are you bothered that I'm doing your job? Chancellor, I'm shocked that you'd ask. Your hands are much more sensitive than mine thanks to your condition, so I'm more than willing to leave this to you. To see an old affliction become a cure, and your tender care for her, how can I not be moved? Ji Ben, let me see your tongue.
But manhood is melted into curtsies, valor into compliment, and men are only turned into tongues, and trim ones too. For he is now as valiant as Hercules who only tells a lie and swears it! I cannot be a man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving. By this hand, I love thee.
Well, they're both so "us." I see. Well, you're fortunate you have someone that loves you. I really am. Love, it's like a delicate flame.
You and your seven brethren will bring joy to yourselves and to everyone. Come on. This is your team. These are your brothers. Everyone, grab an ax.
If you did, you would have done it 28 years ago, when I brought you here. Because you know if I'm dead, you'll never get back to your daughter. And I have a way for us to both get what we want. My hat. I want you to use it again.
-Wyatt? -You're ready to go. Voilá. What, honey? I can't find my tiger! Where'd you put it?
Kurzweil stopped there every third Thursday of every even month, even if he'd filled up the day before. On three of his 18 visits, this SUV was present two hours before. - A dead-drop. - The SUV was registered to the wife of a Turkish oil executive that paid for plane tickets used by an Iranian suspect in the bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires in 1994. The thinnest thread connects Kurzweil and his contact and the machine could see it.

It ran off. You moron! You can't even handle a donkey! I wanted it to run faster, so I smacked its butt. But it was startled.
Because if it's a 3-way, I gotta warn you, that's how I met my ex-husband. Uh, no, it's not that. Your fish. You're getting rid of it? Well, I know how much you hate it.
So what, then? Travis is dead. - Nothing's gonna change that. Maybe we should just get rid of the body. - What?
Yeah. So I guess me question to you is... at the party, did you... did you have sex with me mum? Yeah. About the sex... was it normal? Hmm, it was on a washing machine.
[Chuckles] Last time I checked, you don't give work assignments and Sam is pretty kickass. I'm sure she can handle herself. [Scanner beeps an alert] Oh, my God, the anomaly, it opened. Toby! Dammit! Closed again.
Yes. Is this sexual relationship still active? No. When did this relationship begin? In the spring.
Go away! That move you put on the DB? Come on, you were zigging and zagging like a rastafarian. A move like that needs a name, dawg. Like hell!
You didn't drink anything or eat anything? You said not to, so I didn't. Okay. We're gonna go through consent one more time. This is your arm. Your tumor is right here, near the shoulder.
You said not to, so I didn't. Okay. We're gonna go through consent one more time. This is your arm. Your tumor is right here, near the shoulder. It's stage III. It's pretty big.
- The gamekeeper's antlers. - Why'd you take aim at these? - He shot my dog. - It was running loose in the woods. Why don't you give me the gun? How'd you get it anyway?
You're not of any value to me. I could shoot you right now. All I want is the code. Give it to me and you're free to go. Oops. Pick it up.
Your soul. I want you to take care of it. - Yes... - Thank you. But I have deleted the last sequence, and without it, it's useless. And that's yours, Leo.
I thought it was you, and then I heard Charlotte and Declan, and I... panicked. Well, so much for your stand-up image. You were just gonna let 'em fry me? I told you, I don't know who killed Tyler. But I do know one thing for certain-- the bloody hoodie they found in Lee Moran's car didn't belong to Lee Moran.
Isn't he one of the judges you introduced to bookies? Objection. And weren't you confronted about this at the grand jury? Excuse me, Ms. Nyholm, you have referenced proceedings that resulted in a sealed transcript. Yes, but Mr. Gardner can answer to his own testimony. This question requires your knowledge of the grand jury investigation.
I've got the lead detective ready to go on record, say the whole damn thing was a cover-up as long as I pay for it. Now I'm not exactly ready to bite that fucking bullet, but, goddamn, I mean, we've got him. - We've got Kane by the balls. - We? Yeah, you told me Rosebud was Stone. I did not.
And if they're here... They're gonna be everywhere. The temporalis muscle is atrophied. Any idea why, Dr. Grey? Uh, lack of use?
You? You're their enemy. Division agents only respect what they've been made to fear. They've been made to fear me. My fight was never with you.
Let's steal a boat and go sailing. Honestly, you and Nan... Look! What a lovely sky! Look at it!
You know, I don't believe you. And, you, you're a part of this. See this -- all this? It's not just any zombie movie. This the original zombie movie.
- No, it's important that you come. Important to whom? To me. All right, listen to me. When you were 4 years old, you came home one day with a cat.
Oh, Christ! And plaid? What is he thinking? ! Let's just hope he doesn't see this. This hummus is wonderful.
Thanks for coming... bringing this. Anything you need, Mom. What's so urgent? I got a little disturbing news the other day I wanted to... bounce off my Mexican brethren. It turns out there was this RICO case, right?
My ability to keep you from harm will outweigh your comfort. Do we have an agreement? Sir? Sir? The abduction was unexpected.
It's dark brown as per Ms. Thomas' description. But there's blue and white paint mixed in with the brown. Means it's brown now, but was originally painted white and blue-- a very distinctive white and blue as a matter of fact. Detective Bell. We are looking for a decommissioned NYPD van, presumably sold at auction, then painted brown.
FOWKES: No, but we have a fair idea where it is. In that case that he gave Dave Ryder. That bloody case. Curse of my life. You need to find it.
Says you were with her last night. So work must not be the only thing that's kept your mind off the separation. So what's your point? You asked me if the machine was capable of learning human nature. I'm saying it already is.
We've got some catching up to do. Finch, looks like Wyler's past has come back to haunt him. You'll have access to all the camera feeds through your cell phone. And this alarm system, does it call the local police? No-no, no.
- You're his penis doctor? - Yes. Because that's what an urologist is. Oh. So my penis is fine, right?
Go and look. We did look. Now, Frank says you claimed to have seen... some sort of creature that was alive. Maybe it escaped on its own. I doubt that, Sister.
Not with what I gave it. Okay. Ready. Bring me the cat. What's supposed to happen?
He was somehow connected to my case on Roth and Flynn. The guys who came for the coins. Yeah. God knows those coins aren't healthy to be around. And we did a little more digging, found out Kimura is tied to a secret organization called the dragon's tongue. It was founded in 1901, connected to the Japanese imperial army.
The state buys trains from Siemens without the appropriate network to use them. It also pays contractors for works that are never delivered. There is a certain deliberateness. We degrade our national wealth to slander it after its degradation, and convince Greek public opinion that maybe a private company .is a far better solution for the Greek railways. In the name of rationalisation, the government further degrades the railways.
The whole company will be sold... for a price lower than the cost of one of its units. The Greek people paid for the electricity networks to reach even the smallest villages and these networks will now be exploited by private companies. Most of these private companies feed off the state and earn instead of offering. The public power company was not built by the private sector. It operated for 60 years thanks to the public's money.

- Yeah, I'm okay. Just get her out of the barn, it might bring her back to life. James. James, it's gonna be all right. The barn saved you last time.
Miss Serena? I haven't seen her all summer. I really appreciate you taking the time to meet with me. Yeah, well, it's nice to have someone else asking the questions for a change. Plus Professor Peiser taught my favorite journalism class at Columbia.
- Hey. Dean, come on. - You feel that? - There's a stream. - Go on.
What happened? Why did you throw away the mattress for the sofa bed? If it was because of the blood, I'd have done it in the morning. I did it much later. That's what you say.
Which, coincidentally, is where I had to park my car. Well, I appreciate that. And, uh, just FYI, pigeons nest under there. My car already looks like it's covered in mashed potatoes. I'll get it washed for you.
My mother is my family. My mother... is always watching... like the "Mona Lisa." Like the "Mona Lisa" with a lot of expectations! You look pale... (Distorted voice) Like "Mona Lisa." (Voice echoing) This business is my namesake.
He's just a little scared. You're damn right I am. - You don't screw this up. - We won't. Dr. Ross, you'll make sure that the liver gets here?
It was caused by some sort of defect in the gun's barrel. The grooves and lands show a steep twist to the left. See for yourself. Now, you can wait for the computers to confirm it if you like, but Wade Crewes lied to you about that murder weapon. He didn't dump it.
It'll be easy enough to establish paternity. Okay. So what if he is my dad? How did you find out? My mom kept a diary.
So what's my surprise? Four organized crime members of the Rulanti family were arrested today for the attempted murder of the head of the Spolarno family. And? And not one of the arresting officers was able to tell me where the tip came from. Maybe they didn't know.
Better take care of your house than painting this old tub. It's your ship, mind you! Here's your ship certificate. The elders say, someone has cursed the sea. That's why it retreated.
This thing? What? Did you see it? I don't think so. Oh, you'd know so.
"T99" or "Quadrophonia", you know ... Hold on, I think we blew the fuses. Something others were afraid to do. A thicker sound was a better sound. It had to bite you, get to you.
Just a moment Just a story Just a happy love Nice, huh? I like this song. Me, too.
In my youth, I courted war. War hasn't started yet. You think you could make Loki tell us where the Tesseract is? I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield.
That's not good. That's not good. Jay, you fool. I say unto thee, the power of Christ compels you! Does it?
As your lawyer, I'm legally bound not to discuss it. I know, but, you know, in casual conversation. No one... I mean, no one has ever been closer to me than this young man. I want to make sure he's taken care of forever... no matter what happens to me. The coat costs $300,000.
Just look on the screen and tell me where it is. It does say Miami, Florida. Okay, first things first, I need the armour. Where are we at with it? It's not charging.
And he looked at me. And I will never forget those eyes. His eyes were just like yours. The planet was Furya. I know what it's called.
It gives me time to think about things. I have this clock at home that always helps me think. It's a piece of ormolu. Did you ever hear of it? It's golden, French, 1800s.
Why don't you stop wasting your time? I'm just a lowly factory worker. That suits me fine. But you... You have a gift.
So go before he changes his mind. How you say "crazy" where you come from? We say, "Gift from God." Kolyma, get up! The river is flooding.
And this isn't good, right? Because you want to be the one to kill me. Strange. After all this time, whenever I think about you, Xenya's ribbon. I found it in Aunt Katya's toolshed.
On horseback. Two days ago. It's raised five foot since then. Mr. Wheatfield crossed it. If the bridge was just up.
Yeah, we're going to sit down, okay? You want details? This thing's huge. This is the biggest spider that I've ever seen, maybe the biggest spider on record, and from the look of the bite that it gave that mortician, I'd say this thing is highly poisonous, aggressive, fast, smart. It's strong, really strong.
How do you recognize it in winter? Told you 100 times. I can't remember. When the ash tree was created... it made all the other trees in the forest jealous, because it was...
You too! Dr. Clair this time, you can't stop me. And what is the reason behind this embargo? T.S., do you know where this smell of those marvellous sausages comes from? It's from a smell factory, on the New Jersey Turnpike.
"Born of eternal night "the Dark Elves come to steal away the light." I know these stories. Mother told them to us as children. Their leader Malekith made a weapon out of that darkness and it was called the Aether. While the other relics often appear as stones the Aether is fluid and everchanging.

Foreigners, they can't say J's. MARISOL: And they say it's at a hotel. The people at the hotel gave us a story about you and another man and her, all sexing together in a pile. It's disgusting. But to answer your question, the Lo-yack is an excellent product.
Yes. Fifth Brother, tend our father's wounds. Let's go. Father. I'm going to pull out the arrow now. Don't touch it.
No, the opium does dull the senses. Then I respectfully decline your generous offer. I fall off the ladder. The ladder? The ladder my soul must ascend to heaven.
No one likes gypsies round here. Better make it Madam Zuleika. With a snake around her neck. Snake in the grass. I had a snake once.
I'm to be his wife. I only want to know what that means. Bring me some cheese. The cheese will be served after the cakes, my lady. The cheese will be served when I want it served.
Good bye. Ms. Mochizuki. Where is the camera? Let me see ix. Later.
I think Claire and I have things pretty well under control. If I brought a senior U.S. Congressman into the fund, that would really up my stock in the company. What're you all gabbing about back there? We were talkin' about the old library. Yeah, what's happening to it?
They're not gonna let this end. Not now. Yeah. Well, I'm switching you to buckshot. Yeah. Doesn't have the stopping power of a 12-gauge, but you seem comfortable with it.
If we're to prove you didn't commit these murders, perhaps we should consider how you could have. And then disprove that. If you are this killer, that identity runs through these events like a thread through pearls. Cassie Boyle would have been your first victim. You said her crime scene was practically gift-wrapped.
I knew you'd find out. When did you find out? - 12 weeks ago. - 12 weeks ago? Lung cancer. You don't smoke.
Hello? I'm in here. Got your babysitting duty, huh? Yeah. You mind if I have a quick word with your prisoner?
The painting of my cock should hang at the Louvre. They should study my cock in art classes, spend whole courses studying the splendid contours of its exquisiteness, don't you think? They should also study my cock in science class cos it defies nature. My cock is hard. It's metal, it's steel, it's titanium.
They should study my cock in art classes, spend whole courses studying the splendid contours of its exquisiteness, don't you think? They should also study my cock in science class cos it defies nature. My cock is hard. It's metal, it's steel, it's titanium. It does not break.
It does not break. It does not weaken. My cock can stand all day like a good soldier trying to impress his superiors. If my cock could win a medal, it would. If they could name a school after it, it should.
Sonnets should be written about how dangerous my cheetah cock is. Poems, plays. Wars should be won over it, kingdoms fallen because of it. My cock is lightning. It is fire.
I temped on your desk years back, and I thought about telling you, but then you got fired for the masturbation video, and I missed my chance. If you have a moment, I'd love to suck your dick. [Groaning] Why did you even do the movie? It was such an epic piece of shit. [Chuckles] Crazy Little Thing made close to $300 million worldwide.
Let's give them a little something... Hold still. I love this place. Hey, to this... to this place. I don't feel it.
Who gave you the whole script? I dunno My agent sent it How did he get hold of it? What's the problem?
The tulip was important. I took it from the other timeline, and kept it. When we devised the plan to stop the invasion, you didn't think we could succeed. You doubted yourself. I knew the tulip would give you strength, as it had before. It was your symbol of hope and absolution.
And one will remain here in our present as an anchor. The other one will be sent to a specific point in the future-- 2167. How do we get them to 2167? That's what the magnet is for. It's used as a launch platform.
Barton got the bottle, and... Oh, he buried him in lava. The bottle? What bottle? This old copper jug.
I'm not your wife. I threw my pie for you. The head should pass through your body in three to five days. Unless you start vomiting or have severe cramping, it's best just to let the body eliminate this on its own. I'm gonna have to shit it out.
I threw my pie for you. The head should pass through your body in three to five days. Unless you start vomiting or have severe cramping, it's best just to let the body eliminate this on its own. I'm gonna have to shit it out. If it made it down your esophagus, it should travel the rest of the way.
Were you here the whole time? Well, I'm worried. Thank you, This clock is broken. Yes, it's broken.
- Is it that, or is it Adam? No, everything is fine with Adam. Adam is great. I trust Adam. I just, I just don't know if I'm ready. I can't stop thinking about this SD card.
No, everything is fine with Adam. Adam is great. I trust Adam. I just, I just don't know if I'm ready. I can't stop thinking about this SD card. Why did it disappear when Markussen died?
Excuse me. You cant just barge in on the tour without purchasing a ticket. You're giving us a tour for free. Free. Of course. The Code noir a decree that dictated the conditions of slavery, did not exist on these grounds.
Not much for subtlety. Jesus. Can you trace the source of the email? - Alec? - On it.
- You're right. I cheated, like you. You jumped to the other side. You put me on the other side. I had a deal that put your name right next to mine.
Megan, let's talk about you and how you found this man. I could cast you, you know that. Yes, I'm sure he is a man who plays many roles. Luckily you don't have to worry about censorship with the show because it's so tame. Of course it's for daytime entertainment.
Be graceful at all times... Your Highness! Beautiful, is it not? Unroll it like this, and the story flows out in the pictures. Yeah!
What? If it is truly the fur of the fire-rat it will not burn, but merely glisten all the brighter. Of course! This robe is the genuine article! Placed in the fire, it will not burn.
It's no accident that Zach Hamilton is here. He's drawn to blood, like me. Did he kill Norma Rivera? After a week of vetting him, I haven't been able to find definitive proof. But I'm sure, if I keep following him, the truth will become clear.
Heading in. - What's that? You jack that ring, too? - Yeah. Lyric was telling me about this blue ring her grandmother used to have. She would always try to steal it, but...
I guess they all left. You still want the cherries jubilee? Light 'er up. Hey, if it isn't Jay Plunkett. It isn't.
You're Indian. A mix of slave and assassin! Hurting the Indians won't make you white! I saw the zone. Pedro's work is disgusting.
No, you will try and stop us. I-I can't let either of you go. You didn't know that that was a part of the plan, did you? Listen to me, Briggs, okay? That jawbone, it messes with your head, okay?
It's evidence Petrovic killed her. You said you didn't have it. I lied. He gave me a disc to take home and watch. Thought it would persuade me to tell my story.
- Is Christer Pettersson. - Convicted and acquit within a year. 25 years ago. It's like Monty Python's parrot sketch. Eriksson suggests that the investigation is dead.
And when push came to shove, he felt like he had to pull away for his own well-being. Oh, my God, we are Rihanna and Chris Brown! But I'm Chris Brown. Speaking of Chris Brown, I'm gonna start to batter. How's that stove?
Oh, my God, we are Rihanna and Chris Brown! But I'm Chris Brown. Speaking of Chris Brown, I'm gonna start to batter. How's that stove? Warm, but it's really wobbly.
So, uh... - You like pizza? - Yeah. L-let me guess. You're gonna tell me the best pizza's in New York and I gotta try it, right? Actually, it's in the Kingdom of Damarian on the north shore of the Dragon Fields of Zorn.
My cancer was a death sentence, remember? Yet, here I am. The Dragon. The liquid in the bottle, it worked. It cured me, August.
We don't have a photo. I developed them and there's nothing there. It's all black. You fought for a machine that doesn't work. It's possible.
Can I tell it to you? I see your eyes, in the distance, in the fog. I approach, and I see that you're a wolf. You scare me so much... that I can neither move nor flee. The wolf starts to circle around me. It smells me. It hesitates...
Just when they need her most, she's reaching the limit of her endurance. After 10 days of intensive fishing, the chicks' father comes back to take his turn at the nest. But will he be too late? He greets his young for the very first time. The coolness of the Benguela Current brought the penguins here but that very coolness is a great disadvantage, because it generates little rain.
Now, the desert belongs to the sun alone. The sun has scorched life from the Sahara. And yet the vast desert it created is a source of life half a world away. The advancing Sahara vaporised the world's largest lake, leaving behind the silvery remains of countless microscopic algae. In winter, the wind carries away 700,000 tonnes of this mineral-rich dust every day.
Who the hell were these guys? All their signals were blocked by a very powerful electromagnetic field. I was hoping you could give us some guidance. He was a smartass kid. His armor was weird.
Save the rest for divorce court. Mandy, get your ass down here. You show me where that computer is now. Let's go. Let's go!
Whether we throw the discus, run, do triple jump or are circus clowns, our strength is from the same place. But I'm glad you're paying attention. - Where's the letter? - I don't know where it is. - Isn't it in the box?
Perfectly invisible. And so I dedicate this show to my grandmother's memory. Now... please join me in honoring her with 60 seconds of absolute silence. Okay, Neruda, this play is extremely complicated. Let me guess.
Have a seat. I'll tell you when it arrives. (Kurdish) What happened to your face? A dog attacked me. How did you get away?
I'll tell you when it arrives. (Kurdish) What happened to your face? A dog attacked me. How did you get away? I attacked back, it got scared and ran away.
Hey. National Guard's en route. Meanwhile, the State Police are manning the roadblocks. Coast Guard is monitoring the waterways. We've got two choppers in the air, DC's sending more. Okay. So what about the Sheriff's residence?
Women get old faster than men. That's life. Come on. Let's not keep them waiting. I know what I'm saying. National service, it has become worthless.
Why you got a rental, Mike? Excuse me? Busted up your ride, racing around town like you got a Mad Tyte JDM? I have no idea what you just said. Where's your car?
- Be quiet! Why is Clea in prison? You were raised far from reality. You trust anyone. You recognize this ring?
In seven days, Tung's spirit will come back. It may be the perfect time then. May be? What if it doesn't work? If it doesn't work, there's another way. What is it?
Okay, there were always two things standing in our way: your uncontrollable side-- which is no longer a problem-- and Muirfield. You would just... leave everything? I found a town like the one yesterday. It's about two hours outside of Denver.
Is this the same... Yeah. Yeah, I guess it is. Your mom really does hate change. Oh, I visited our fort today.
And I command the one piece of evidence. May it benefit you. I'm sure it will. The Spear of Longinus? It has touched the very blood of your Christ.
May it benefit you. I'm sure it will. The Spear of Longinus? It has touched the very blood of your Christ. You know where it is?
I'm sure it will. The Spear of Longinus? It has touched the very blood of your Christ. You know where it is? It sat deep beneath Jerusalem, buried, for centuries.
A word or two with your new friend. I always knew there was someone behind Ingram. Like a black hole. Invisible, but powerful. So tell me, where did you move the machine?
Like a black hole. Invisible, but powerful. So tell me, where did you move the machine? It moved itself. But who controls it?
They wanted to kill Thornhill. He was buying up all the pay phones in Manhattan, but they stopped him. I don't know about you, but I don't want to see what happens when an evil multinational becomes omniscient. But why you would leave it so vulnerable? You made the machine to protect everybody.
I like a lot of tea. - Well... - You're a little picky. Maybe I'm a little picky. Can people really change? Is our personality genetically pre-programmed?
- What're you doing? ! - What're you doing? It's the military chip they put in her head, it makes her loco, you better watch that. Maybe you need to wake up, start thinking for yourself? This kind of tactic gets us nowhere.
- Can we not? Why are you snapping at me all day? - I'm not snapping. - Yeah, you are. I'm sorry I asked the question.
Er, no. But it's alive. Yes, but it doesn't breathe. Like a fish. A fish doesn't breathe? Like an oyster.
Yes, but it doesn't breathe. Like a fish. A fish doesn't breathe? Like an oyster. So, when it's washed up, it's dead? Yes.
Well, should I let you get back to it? Hell no. What's that? I have two of them, from a surgery I had to correct misshapen cartilage I was born with. I had a bar put in when I was 14.
Not every time. Oh, my God, this house is amazing! Well, it's... Yeah. And look at that view.
They belong to all of us. You're insane. Friends don't call friends names. I know what the mirror does Jordyn. Look into it and gain your deepest desire.
Losing a member of your pack isn't like losing family. It's like you lose a limb. They wouldn't even let him see the body. Somebody called for a... I want his body.
-Okay. Good. I am looking for the owner of a hubot. It is a 400 TwinX. A female.
Hey Mom, I know what I want for my... Where are you going? Where are we going? We're leaving. I packed your suitcase.
I done a lot of killing, both during and after the war. Mr. Durant and Senator Metcalf here, they'll call me a murderer as it suits them. But no matter what they call it, it won't bring back those men, or my family. Damn sure won't change who I am. You're refusing to sign the statement?
He was fingerprinted for his security clearance, but he doesn't have a DNA sample on file. So, in the messages that she passed on to that reporter, Vanessa Hiskie, did... she never referred to Kleinfelter by name? Excuse me. Did you find that book in this box? Yeah.
These things happen. Clearly I have been set up by someone. That's what you get when you ruffle feathers. Mrs Blunt said the library door was locked when she came back to the house. Well, obviously someone locked it when they left.
Crane, your gun! What are you doing? You dropped your gun. It was empty. You only fired one shot.
And it could hear the cries of those in sorrow. So you believe. I believe El Cucuy wanders from place to place. And waits until it is called by voices of women who have suffered from evil. If enough voices cry out, they become one voice that cannot be ignored.
Divinity of the Elements, I summon Thee. Earth, Water, Air, Fire, I invoke Thee. Must be an electrical fault. You saw it. - I don't know what you're talking about.
Ooh, Chicago! There is this pizza place called Gazzola's. It's fantastic.
He slips it on her finger And the choir begins to sing Does the spearmint lose its flavor On the bedpost overnight? If you pull it out like rubber
How many pods are there? No idea. It's a big ocean. How many mermaids could they summon in an emergency? You might be in some trouble, mate. That trident's mine.
Which is important research, but at this point, it's research, Meredith. And what I'm talking about could save a life. I can't stop it in the middle. It will completely destroy the model. Just because I printed a fork does not mean my research is a joke.
Now let's destroy it. How rare to stare into the face of Death. Something I never intend to do again. There's a junkyard in Tarrytown with an industrial car compactor. I've seen it turn an SUV into an ice cube.
There's a price on your head. There's a running price on my head, Agent Ressler. Anslo Garrick? Listen to me. If this intel was disseminated, it was done so directly to you.
The curse was built to be unstoppable. There's nothing that can be done. Well, it is possible to stop it. - What? - By using the scroll itself.
uh, there was a fire. big question is, what are you doing here? what, did somebody call in a missing doughnut? uh, actually someone reported they couldn't find your head. but we found it.
You shed bras. That is untrue and unkind. You stay over my place for the weekend, And there's hair all over every pillow, and a bra on every door knob. You got a bra in my silverware drawer. - Oh, which one?
Camille, what are we doing? - Come to see my bear. - Why? Last week, there was a young boy here with a crust of bread he'd spread with honey. He threw it, but his aim was bad.
It's about all of us. Right now, it's about you. And you still can change everything. Oh, we got a hugger. Be careful.
They kill us before we find a working car. Okay. So, what' the current plan? Two cars we haven't tried yet. - The minivan and the green SUV. - Yeah. Okay. I'll head for the SUV, draw the mimics to me. You go for the minivan.
We need to get on deck. The time is almost up. And the engine? Where is the engine? - It got wedged in.
That's funny. Because we're having a little bit of a situation here! The phones are going crazy. What happened at that reading? Well, it was a really good crowd.
- No. I can't do it. I can't do this, I'm so sorry. Ben's been through all this before. His grief isn't new.
I can't do it. I can't do this, I'm so sorry. Ben's been through all this before. His grief isn't new. But it's new for me.
I can't do this, I'm so sorry. Ben's been through all this before. His grief isn't new. But it's new for me. And it'll be new tomorrow.
We build our own shelter. Whatever we need, the Box provides. The rest is up to us. The Box? Yeah.
Hey, well, maybe take a day or two, make sure you like it. Or I can take 10 years. I'm fucking with you, Joshy. Your thing is gonna be totally brilliant. I remember when this song was just considered bad.
- You're just a little rusty. You don't understand. It's not a question of being rusty. I can flip the switches. I can turn the knobs. But my power comes from here. It comes from...
And that which sinks from that which rises. He destroys all, but only to start again. You sure? Yes. The storm cannot be stopped.
- Oh, yeah. MAN: There it is. This tornado just touched down. We can see it from here.
- Guys. Guys. Guys. -Will you stop it? Come on. Let's not argue, okay? We came up with an awesome plan. It is smart.
25 at most. Seriously, it's not a joke? You're really keeping this? Er, yeah. Sure?
You said there was nothing between those stations. Not on the maps, but once you eliminate the other factors, the remaining thing must be the truth. That carriage vanished, so it must be somewhere. But why, though? Why detach it in the first place?
What's it doing out there? This thing is like any intelligence. It needs to grow. To advance. Right now, it's settling somewhere it thinks it's safe from outside threats. Somewhere its massive appetite for power can be met.
It needs to grow. To advance. Right now, it's settling somewhere it thinks it's safe from outside threats. Somewhere its massive appetite for power can be met. But it will want more than that. After a while survival won't be enough.
It turns out Beth, Mickey and Theo were right. A few weeks after I left, my dad got shitfaced drunk in a bar, and confessed to killing my mother. He hung himself in his jail cell with a sheet. Before he died, he revealed that my mother's body was in the freezer, and that he'd taken it out during the night while I was sleeping. He buried her up in the mountains.
Great news, Muppets. We're sold out. Fine. I mean, great, great. Well done, Dominic. Hey, I have an amazing idea for an act.
It is a fierce and jealous love, Bilbo. It sent his grandfather mad. Balin, if Thorin... had the Arkenstone... or if... it was found... would it help? That stone crowns all. It is the summit of this great wealth... bestowing power... upon he who bears it.
That stone crowns all. It is the summit of this great wealth... bestowing power... upon he who bears it. Would it stay his madness? No, laddie. I fear it would make him worse.
What have I done? If I cannot liveth with thee... then I shall not liveth at all. That frog is not poisonous. What? We're not dead?
That's good. You're amazing. - What are you doing? This plant needs to be pruned... in order to grow right. So, I was...
Don't blame me! What he's saying is different from the stories. What do you mean? The Death Wolf isn't a demon. It's meant to go after wicked folk.
They spent about 40 years in the desert trying to escape. Yeah. We have dinner once a year and talk about it. It's a big deal for us. Listen, could you take a look at that tablet? There's something wrong with it.
Shut up right now! Do you want to be smashed? Yeah, you can run, but if you leave those gates... I swear to you, your hideous doppelganger... who looks a lot like the lead singer of the Counting Crows... will get it! Dada. That's right.
Ah, her sweet boy. How'd you get the simulit back? You know, our machine. The Shadow. When you sold it to Robbie, how'd you get it back? I didn't.
- I don't see how it could... - Oh, with the right lawyer, certainly. I know a man, ex-member himself, very useful at sorting out our scrapes over the years. I don't give a shit about the club. Smash it.
OK, you asked for it. Ohh! Right. Are you concentrating yet? You broke my arm! No, I sprained it.
It's a common problem. Never put your keycard with your phone. What happens if I use the card now? It still doesn't work. But it doesn't read as the wrong card now.
He probably doesn't see you. - Oh, it fucking sees me. - It ha... it has night vision. - They have night vision? That tiger has night vision goggles?
- Oh, it fucking sees me. - It ha... it has night vision. - They have night vision? That tiger has night vision goggles? It doesn't have night vision goggles.
Should I put it down here? - What do you take out first? - This. Yes, exactly. So, the needle, you have to secure it. Good.
No, not at all. He used to take them for fun. We used to fuck for hours. His cock was like a battering ram. It was like it was made of liquid metal.
Nice. A warm welcome to this beautiful island. As we all know, this could hardly be a more threatening moment. We meet at a dangerous time when a setback in the financial markets has been misrepresented as a crisis in the engine room of capitalism itself. We all remember how quickly the Berlin Wall came down.
I know four people are dead. Where's my flight key? MPs took it. Check the data on it. It'll have all my keystrokes logged, back up what I'm saying.
Hello? Are you there? Yeah. I have a bad connection. I'm listening. I have a... I have a message for you.
Ladies and gentlemen, this will be Charles' and Tom's first. I am so happy that you have this to share together. Oh, and one last reminder. The weapons' rack is stocked with the latest and the greatest. And my personal favorite is the Mauser Elite SSX Double Barrel. It has a delicate trigger, and smoothest discharge.
Excuse! I'm sorry. Bye. The Burguesinha is well loose. More Than in Cheers.
We were careful not to wake you. You should let me know if you're not coming home. I told you. You told me a lot yesterday. I like Marie-Colette's magazine.
No one will hurt you. You just have us all tell me what you know. Are we clear? The exchange is tomorrow held in Luxembourg. I do not know where I should at Jacob Sturm wait with the expert.
This was given to me by the Director of the Smithsonian. It's the first Medal of Honor awarded to a Hispanic-American, Corporal Joseph De Castro. He fought for the Union. Linda, I don't know what to say. It's clear the President sees you as a friend. I've never been that to him. But his job is bigger than friendship.
You find a place to live yet? Turn to your left. We call this "proximity overlook." Yeah, well, the rest of the world calls it stalking. What you're seeing here is aerial surveillance footage of the Bawri Tana marine combat outpost -- or what's left of it.
Over in Asia, professional gamers are treated like rock stars. It's a viable career opportunity. They actually live in gamer houses. So it's set up to be a thing all year long. I think their approach to practice is that it's like a day job. The fan base is immense.
These linens, I will purchase, obviously. Carved-wood stools... Anything, mosaic works, as well. This lamp is perfect! But that's not for sale.
And this. Important men get their pictures taken. His name really was Hank. Well, Henry. Henry Renard, the only son of Harrison Renard. So, tell me about this company, Delphi.
I know how to stop it. If you really want to kill your brother, Margot, wait until you can get away with it. Or find someone to do it for you. You said you were worried about the bird. Thought you might like to see it.
He's doing a healing. This shouldn't take too long. This way. My boy's wound won't heal. It never heals.
Thank you. But not everyone is a viable candidate. There will always be people with a need for companionship and... and connection. If your board had let me finish, I would have told them that filling that void is way more important than building a more empathetic service bar. I'm sure you understand that the future you're proposing raises great moral questions.
So, what happened with Myles? He went home with some guy last night. That's great. Your plan worked. Yeah.
I was with her for a while. Is she dead? She's just gone. After that, that's when they found me. I mean, I knew they were bad, but they had a code.
- My brother Caleb was here. - What? She's lying! Can't you see that? Norman, stop it! He can't help it!
You owe us an ending. I owe you nothing. I am a dungeon master. I create a boundless world, and I bind it by rules. Too heavy for a bridge?
I think you're going to love it. I spent so many hours playing with this when I was your age. Yeah, me too. Hey, quick, turn off your car. Why?
You say you're an interface? Your eyes and your ears are your ports, input and output? We can put a stop to that. There is a bone in the back of your ear. It's the stapes... or stirrup.
Shit. Unfortunately we can not help it, Lunde. People want this. We have to...? That chair in front of you, we are very proud.
I didn't ask you to favour me. - Done this before? - No. Put this on and remove your chain. - It's a lucky charm. - Put it on later. I can't take it off.
It's not possible. Exactly why the Russians won't expect it. At high tide, we'll have two, three feet clearance. That canal is so narrow, we won't have any margin for error. And then there's the coral growth.
It sounds to me like a good choke point with multiple escape routes. I think we found the location of Kelly's next job. That's not all we found. I've got research here, something about a Bible-- the Gutenberg Bible? The Gutenberg Bible?
I think we found the location of Kelly's next job. That's not all we found. I've got research here, something about a Bible-- the Gutenberg Bible? The Gutenberg Bible? It's on a world tour.
That's not all we found. I've got research here, something about a Bible-- the Gutenberg Bible? The Gutenberg Bible? It's on a world tour. It's leaving New York tomorrow for Venice, Italy.
What's wrong with curing malaria? Or don't you want to make the world a better place? Let me explain something to you. The sun throws a certain amount of energy onto this planet. We turn it into food, clothing, shelter, et cetera.
See? Do you like the rabbit? Do you? You see? Do you like the rabbit? You like it?
- I don't get it. Wasn't the whole point of a fireman costume to justify the fire extinguishers? You know, the ones we'll need in order to put out any fires at the parade? The plan is constantly evolving, Sue. It's alive.
And what is it you want here warrior? Who are you? Tell me. Tell me who it is I'm touching. So much pain this body has seen.
I don't live in a building. I live here. - Where? All I see is a dumpster. - Yeah, it's my apartment. I converted it, and I live inside.
Why did you even come home tonight? Was the sex bad? Did you hit him? No, the sex was fine. Actually, it was better than fine.
I'll think about it. You think about it, then you give me a call when you realize that you really can have it all. I found your Mustang. Looks like it's been abandoned. I'm going to check it out.
The only way Da Silva sails off into retirement is if the boss dies. That file is unusable as a nuclear arsenal. He kept it solely to remind Pardillo of their mutually-assured destruction. Well, it won't be much use to a DA, either. I stole it from his office.
"Your friend, Ambrose." Whoever broke into Ambrose's house was looking for this. This rosary he mentions. Valuable, is it? It's reputed to have healing powers. You don't say?
How are you supposed to see cross traffic when the sidewalk's a damn jungle? You're fired. What? You're fired. The address calculation code. It's too long.
I have something important to say, I had to kill and will even dying to be on TV, I call you the facts, The U,S, government is funded by the rich, It keeps the people on the intellectual level of children,
And I'm talking about facts, The NSA stores all calls, E-mails and SMS, People like Snowden or Assange, which provide valuable information, be prosecuted by the U,S, government, It is funded by the rich, She wants the people ignorant and hold the intellectual level of children,
Yeah, but we know the truth, don't we? You're a coward. I learned that the day you kicked out the crate from beneath me. I think I found it. Get outside.
It's called lichen and it's highly toxic. I need to know if Yuki has consumed any. If he has the poison, just treat him. I'm sorry, but not without knowing the species. I need a sample.
- Only minor. The white wolf was exactly where you said it would be. But we have two problems now. First, the lichen is not a cure. It'll wear off in a matter of days.
Hear me out. What we're dealing with here is basically someone who lacks motive. No rhyme, no reason, right? Meaning what? Our enemy is not a killer.
A Rob Roy. Rob Roy. Yeah. You had a few of them, if I'm not mistaken. What about the Hess case? What about it?
Hey! I heard gunshots. What's going on up there? Then the Aswang would flick its long black tongue and eat the baby. No... uh, actually, no, not at first.
So, sir, popcorn setting, always too short, am I right? I'm sorry? On our microwave. We have the same microwave. Oh, I didn't buy it.
Okay. So there's a fully-stocked fridge with snacks. Sling is over there, nipple clamps on the bedside table with some erotic oils and handcuffs. Dildos and toys are on the wall. Oh, I got that strap-on in Zanzibar in the 19th century.
Yes, my name's Gareth Lestrade. I'm a... I'm a detective. I wondered if I might ask you a few questions about the man that mugged you. Did you get it? Did the file open up all right?
I-I need to know what happened. Finch, I've got eyes on a sniper. And I might have a lead on who's doing the shooting. The solicitation Ms. Groves gave me is visually identical to an image commonly sent out as spam. But digitally someone has hidden a message inside the image.
I can't ping a tower, nothing. There's no way to access her phone log. I got it. I broke the encryption. All right. Look up her internet searches.
Something terrible happened. A... A submarine... Just say it. A submarine went down... the Belomorsk. We lost 160 men... a... a catastrophic propeller malfunction of some kind.
Hey, Rory. How you doing? Besides the fact that I have bone cancer, I'm great. Seriously. Look at this polish.
And welcome to the Badlands. We are currently transporting the latest, most advanced mineral extraction equipment from Cedars to the boom-town of Defiance. It's a small town, big of heart. Let's swap sides. My right side is...
Those are the facts as we currently know them. Just because Lily didn't shoot Toby doesn't mean she wasn't involved in whatever got him shot. - Is that your gut? No, my gut says that whoever ran away is our killer and that Lily Greene is a completely innocent schoolteacher who just had the worst night of her life. Would you like a cup of coffee?
But I got a call from the editor of New York Lawyer, and they want to interview the man responsible for making that happen. And you want to give Harvey the credit. I want you to take your name off. I already did. This case was never for me.
"this is super awkward." And you know, sometimes she arches her back when she says it, like this. "This is super awkward." This is super awkward. You know, I bet you if I stayed in Poland, my sisters and I would have had our own show.
Where'd you get the machete? It was on the chair. He was coming after me, so I just... I shoved him into the hallway and... and closed my eyes, and I swung as hard as I could. You always keep a machete in your room? It's not mine.
I believe you love your country. I believe that when you started, people thought what you were doing made a lot of sense. But it's gone too far, and it has to stop. Please, who built the machine? How does it work?
Anger Management 2x53 - Charlie and His Probation Officer's Daughter - Original air date March 20, 2014 Did you find the mouse yet? No, I just finished setting the traps. Don't worry.
For the past ten years, you have lived here, in the safety of France, and I've seen too much suffering at home. And you would ask of my heart? Ask me that question when you have earned the right. The day of my marriage, a secret contract was slipped in amongst the others. The French arranged it with my mother.
You just need to come up with little tricks to help jog your memory. My memory doesn't jog. I've smoked so much pot, it's in one of those hospitals learning to walk again. What was the Great Compromise? You mean besides you moving in with me?
In seven days, we run out of food. In 14, people will be starving. In 21, we'll turn on each other. The time to act is now. How'd this virus get inside the dome?
There are more. Just since this morning. A dozen of them. Quarantine the healthy animals. This is what Rebecca was messing around with in her kitchen. That pig virus is their extermination plan.
You keep looking at that plant. It's a Ficus benjamina. Popular choice in decorative office greenery. Thrives even when neglected. The Ficus is an aggressive grower;
I'm on the heavy side of the seesaw right now. A little to your right. My right. Damn it, Ginsberg. Put it back.
Holy shit. See? See? You forgot about Andy already. Why, you're... You're a freak.
I got to be honest. That was the best spaghetti I've ever had. You know what the trick is? You throw a noodle up on the ceiling. If it sticks, you know it's perfect.
That was the best spaghetti I've ever had. You know what the trick is? You throw a noodle up on the ceiling. If it sticks, you know it's perfect. It's still on my ceiling, isn't it?
Did you park your white horse outside? Spare me the suspense and tell me what your "save the day" plan is. I don't have anything yet. The idea I had wasn't great. It wasn't great.
You ever talk to my wife again, I will kill you. So classical four-dimensional general relativity combined with the nuclear forces can explain the relative abundances of all known elements in the universe. You finally looked at my paper, congratulations. I looked at it when I rejected it from the Physics Review a year ago. But that line wasn't a line from your paper.
You tell them. It will mean more coming from you, neena. You're never going back in there. You should not make promises you cannot keep. My freedom is temporary.
- She's the one... - She's accusing me of losing a kidney... - I said settle down! Oh, I found it! They dumped it in the basin.
- you've ever said. - decide whether or not I go to jail tonight! We don't have time to fight! We need to make a decision and commit to it. So if someone has a better idea, say it now! Heads, we get the body.
The Daleks got here before us. You don't like soldiers much, do you? You don't need to be liked. You've got all the guns. A moleculon nanoscaler! You know what it does, then?
Oh, I miss that sound. That's it. It has to be. I'm gonna call Neal. Hey, we opened the file.
It matters to me. Mary, listen to me. To free him would reveal what you are to him. You think he could love you then? Do not lose his love.
And all those flu-like symptoms? Were plaque filling the vessels of your heart. And now my heart is filled with a different pain. Before I forget, um, in my bag, there is a file I meant to give you earlier. There it is, in my purse.
Can I go now? Look, I know your father's looking out for you. But who's looking out for Marvin? Claudette. How was your drive?
I could swear the train ticket hadn't been used. I would swear it. What? I saw the ticket in Mrs Hughes's hand when she found it in the coat. It hadn't been torn in half.
Everyone has family they're trying to find. I'm just trying to keep from losing anyone else along the way. How long does she expect to keep going if she keeps giving her rations away? The rest of us are dehydrated, aslee-- It came through the brush.
Wait. You make it seem like they've got a mind of their own. They do. This isn't just physical strength. There's an alien life-form fusing with your human DNA. It -- it wants to control all of you.
You may resume your ritual after I speak to Tom Mason about the Beamer. The Beamer is important. So, why the hell did you interrupt? ! I have been deconstructing the Espheni whistle you brought back. You are correct.
Bull's-eye, Matt. Bull's-eye. Before his untimely death, my brother implemented a safeguard. That triskelion she wears -- it doesn't mean "peace." It never did.
You were lucky to have that transgender person to help. Thanks for what you did. Bates's gear is not all it's cracked up to be. There is a bad stash of gear coming into the prison.
Grandma thought it was adorable. You okay? Last night my printer went off by itself. I couldn't turn it off. I hit the cancel button.
I have to take you back to Eichen, Lorraine. No. No. I don't think you're gonna be taking me anywhere. I can hear the recorder in your pocket.
Those women, they rush the stage like these are the last men on the planet. I have bruises that I can't explain. Ladies be crazy, Javi. The card's rfid architecture is like nothing I've ever seen. Yeah, but there's got to be something else that you can tell us about it.
- It's like the Munroe effect. A Navy man at the turn of the century invented incendiary warheads. Bazooka rockets. He called them shaped charges. But a nuclear core is no rocket.
I'm glad you're here. You're welcome. You could've left him in the building, you know. I'd be tempted. Can you get anything from your computer?
Hello. This is the manager. Hello? Turn the noise down! Turn it the fuck down, you motherfuckers! There are other people in the fucking world!
More than effective against your mail-order magic. My men are unburdening Ian Fell of his problem as we speak. Thanks to you, Constantine. What do you want with the acetate, Midnite? There's no money it in.
- What's happening? There's only one true way to deal with our recording. I drew on the disc's own dark magic to send it back to hell where it belongs. It belongs to me. It's mine!
I was two seconds from deciding that I wasn't gonna go. I wasn't gonna leave the room until Damon walked in to give me my birthday gift. It was a necklace that Stefan had given me. I'd lost it, and Damon knew what the necklace meant to me. My necklace.
I'm sorry we couldn't save Anthony. Anthony died protecting me. It's up to me now to make sure his sacrifice wasn't in vain. What will you do? You told me you wouldn't help me fight a war, John. Well, sometimes a war comes to you.
Benoît living here with you, finding a job at the same hospital where you work. - Are you two together again? - Honestly... This is the last time I give you a plant. - Why? Look at it.
Okay. Okay. You're having an emotional reaction to your surroundings. Tell me what you're feeling. This couch is terrible. It doesn't match anything.
- Wasn't me. Then where'd it come from? Ho, ho, ho! Well, that sucked. So the letter was actually from her parents?
Uh, yeah. It's good to meet you, Nathan. It's good to meet you, too, Caleb. I guess the first thing I should do is explain your pass. Now, it's simple enough.
Her parents wouldn't have come. Come on. Off we go. I'm seeing stars, my foot hurts so much. It could be broken.
Let me go home. MAN: You're absolutely positive? His solution was correct. He'd had it for years.
Hey. He's the machine. I'm Reese. It's me, Sarah. All right, listen, the terminator's not dead.
Especially those that fester in a man's soul. What's yours? I am not a great writer. I am not Hawthorne. But from my first hearing of it, this tale has haunted me.
...I've always wanted to be a dad. Let me tell you, I love it! Yeah! And I love my Ford Flex. It treats me to a smooth ride, and you know what?
- What's the ABX at? - What's ABX? It tracks subprime mortgage bond value. Go back to sleep. The ABX is at...
- That sounds nice. I would like that. - Yeah. Finally. Mark, hey. It's a bloodbath up here. Morgan stock has lost half its value. It's down to 23. 10.
It worked! Could you see me down at the gas pumps? I was jumping all over the place. I was so excited. Felt weird pointing a rifle at you even if it weren't loaded. Oh, I always keep it loaded.
Not to the Snake! It wasn't my choice. It was time for goodbye. You understand that it is too far? I cannot carry this body with me.
And I sent you a picture of me and Polenta. She misses you. Oh, hell no. Where is my purse? Have you seen it anywhere?
Especially when that something is the Krabby Patty. Okay, everybody, let's get back to Bikini Bottom and... Oh, no! I don't have the page! Oh, no!
♪ You know ♪ I finally got out of that place ♪ ♪ It's true ♪ Old friends are just such a waste ♪ The coach was heading to London.
Let your customers decide. My family's been going to you my whole life. Look, the big companies, they pay me for my shelf space. Maybe you can sell one of your mops to those big companies. And maybe they'll put it on my shelf.
Well, I don't really care what the burro wants. Get out of my bank, you beast! I know what you're thinking, but not yet. Hold it. How is this jackass stuck?
Whoa, what's going on? Sir... we were unable to acquire the droid on Jakku. It escaped capture... aboard a stolen Corellian YT model freighter. The droid... stole a freighter? Not exactly, sir.
You'll be relieved to hear I have no idea. You still want to kill me. That happens when you're being hunted... by a creature in a mask. Tell me about the droid. He's a BB unit with a selenium drive... and a thermal hyperscan vindicator.
Come on, Edith, come with me. Let's take you upstairs. I thought you said the dog was dead. I left it out there on its own. Thought it would perish in the cold.
I'm Don Champagne. Why don't you shake the hand that's gonna shock the world. What happened to your hand? I actually... I dropped a couch on it. Was it heavy?
That faction could no longer be trusted. She killed our parents. Our parents brought that on themselves. What are you talking about? The box?
Go, Susan! That was not part of my plan. Just like a woman to wear jewelry into battle. Although, this is the ugliest fucking necklace I've ever seen! Yes, it is.
Please, I beg you. Don't kill me. I'm not gonna kill you. I have a job for you. And a gold coin if you get it done.
So, we'll see you tomorrow morning. Good night, ladies. Good night. - What about your jacket? Keep them.
So, stop this stuff about improving their conditions, deal with the system, or else you're not serious. [Kasser] Our economic system is one of consumer capitalism, and that's why the government needs to have consumption at very high levels, um, and why, of course, the corporations do, and why at some level most people then buy into it. I can't tell you the number of people I talked to who say, "Well, but if we became less materialistic our economy would tank." Well, they're right in some level, because our economy is based on materialism, it's based on these kinds of values. That's what it needs in order to survive.
That's why they tell you to strip. - It's a theater here! - You gotta show them your panties. And you idiots! Tell her to shake it.
Come on, Kate! Of course you are. Look, Harold was an accountant. If there's anybody leading a resistance in this town, it's not Harold, so who else is involved in this group? This group is the only thing that's kept me sane here. How long have you been active?
Shes been here a year now. - She came here for her sorfs sake. - Is he sick? It's strange, it comes and goes. But he's doing well now, the fresh air will do him good.
- She came here for her sorfs sake. - Is he sick? It's strange, it comes and goes. But he's doing well now, the fresh air will do him good. It does everyone good.
You bastards. What, you couldn't have done better, Torstein! I don't care about that game. I want you to cut off my arm. - Why not keep it?
The Mosasaurus! Oh, my God! That was awesome! Hold on tight. We're gonna give you an even closer look at our Mosasaurus.
Where do they go? Megan? We have no time. There's a western tunnel. It leads to an elevator. I know the code.
So to even the score... God populated the land... with a race of evil men. The primary impediment to a free and uninhibited future is the violence and terror that currently grips our beloved country. A violence initiated by these evil men... will be brought to justice... in the name of decency... and in the memory of Luis Carlos Galán. We will extradite. This decision... will not come from fear.
The shroud was right here. Essentia crescat. One skin cell, one strand of hair, that's all I need to grow a piece of Aleister. There is no getting used to this. What will this spell accomplish?
- With all these? When Grandma was alive, there were a lot more. There were so many, we gave them to all the neighbours. This plum tree's getting old. I think Grandpa planted it the year mum was born.
Eddie, my boy, you know that I love you. And why not? You're a genius, you shit gold, and Oscars are made of gold. But this film is different. It's humane, you know?
So you're the chappie who's going to translate the mythical language? Not so mythical as you think, young man. The Verbis Diablo, the Devil's Tongue, has roots as old as Aramaic and likely much older. It was an oral tradition for the most part like most now dead languages. We haven't entirely lost it, we've just forgotten it.
- So this is where you live? - Is it? Disguise it as you might try, Sir Malcolm recognised your picture. Perhaps he's just a fan from my theatrical days. Do you know of the medical neurosis called the phantom limb?
But whatever. All right, try to keep it up for three minutes. Begin. This fruit is defective. How so?
All right, try to keep it up for three minutes. Begin. This fruit is defective. How so? It's all nasty and bruised up.
Of course, I play Edwina. I know she has freckles and a more ample bosom than I, but I think we can use our imaginations. How do I put this constructively? This piece of writing is".obscene. It's pornographic.
Or... I don't know. He expresses it more or something. There now... Did you hear that my boys paid the locals a visit? They bought a goat and are calling it Preben.
You seem very nervous these days. Hummm... So relax. It isn t complicated. The truth has no need for ploys.
Hummm... So relax. It isn t complicated. The truth has no need for ploys. It s naked, it doesn t say anything, it s obvious.
Chuck, did you read this? Read what? This bill, did you read it? Emergency room bill. I may have glanced at it.
It's really exciting to talk to you. It really is. Oh, you guys are very sweet. So, Penny, listen, I saw your movie. Oh, wow.
HP. Much better! Hans Peter? My husband? The Camino robs you of all of your strength... and gives you three times as much back. And to all those who cannot walk the Camino, rest assured, this Way is only one of an endless number of possibilities.
How about this guy? He's on vacation. In the meantime, I think we found a way inside. We've been combing through the employee records, looking for a shell. - I'm cooking the ID now.
Kira's thinking USF. Malia's, uh, gonna, you know, she'll figure something out, okay. The plan's perfect. Or we could also wait until we actually get into college and then figure out where to live. I have a vision, dude.
It'll help a lot. Of course, it's only a drop in the bucket. I swear, everyone I know has had problems with them. I had one. The computer in the engine, it locked in the middle of the Rockies.
- We've been pen pals. What have you been doing with yourself? You look so different. You look exactly the same. Good, you found my backpack.
Hi. Hey, sweetie, how's it going? It's going great. I can't hear you. Where are you? I'm at the library. Nice.
His writing is gorgeous. Well, in my opinion, it isn't. Said the guy who can't write a grocery list. - Shh, shh... - Ready whenever you are, sir. Today marks the 80th Anniversary of the Social Security Act.
French lives have been lost, Perales. Enough is enough. Then I accept. Your Majesty has shown great wisdom and discretion. Do this, and you will never lay your hands on the cipher.
I may be up to more than you realize. Everett... I think it's time for us to rebuild our family. Leave the light on. Note the effect on the pupils of a few drops of adrenaline chloride.
At Cromartie. I paid you in heroin. Excuse me. Everyone knew you were the famous Dr. Thackery. You say I fixed it with a gold earring?
I emancipated myself from you. I have nothing to do with you! Nothing to do with me? Our connection runs much deeper than a hand print. Deeper than hell shoes.
There's one missing... Hi Dagny. God you're beautiful. Famous words to a succubus. The last thing your mother said to me was your name.
That is the signal for my friends to come here, and... [P.A. feeds back] Cage: My fellow citizens, this is your president speaking. I have news to share with you that will change all of our lives forever. For 97 years, Mount Weather has been our home.
How do you know Tom's killer had a blue jacket? From you! You asked Dave if I had a blue ja... I saw a blue jacket in the woods with a bloodstain on it. I thought you'd want to know!
Well, I guess this really isn't the kind of place where you get to know your neighbors. You're talking about 1017, aren't you? That smell, am I right? Smell? Oh, yeah, there's some sort of an odor.
Do I keep you for what's easy? Do you think I've promoted you for the charm of your presence? I keep you because you're a serpent. Do not be a viper in my bosom. You know my decision.
The teacup's broken. It's never going to gather itself back together again. Not even in your mind? Your memory palace is building. It's... full of new things.
I've done things that I'm not proud of, Vanessa. I've hurt people... and I'm going to hurt more. It's impossible to avoid for what I'm trying to do. But I take no pleasure in it... in cruelty. But this city isn't a caterpillar.
Anti-pully week? You misspelled it. Do you know the story of the bumblebee? The bumblebee is too heavy to fly. It has a very dense body and tiny wings.
You could tell stories about yourselves. You can't tell stories about people like us. I'm not so sure about that. Did you know that the bumblebee is unable to fly? It shouldn't be able to fly with its tiny wings.
Someone who saw Spencer Hastings in the DiLaurentis backyard with a girl, a blonde dressed in Alison's clothes, the night that Bethany was buried in that yard. Who was the witness? Jessica DiLaurentis. Mrs. DiLaurentis saw Spencer in the backyard and told the police? Where's the statement been for two years?
Francis? Where did it make landfall? - It didn't. - What? The hurricane turned. It's due east now.
Where did it make landfall? - It didn't. - What? The hurricane turned. It's due east now. It might hit Bermuda.
I am talking as I want! -And you called me stupid! Because you are stupid! Are you satisfied? I lost my job because of you. You did not lose it. You know where it is.
No, Michelle is not going anywhere. Maybe not. But Devon is. So this office printer wasn't on the same network as the other printers? No, it was. Then why didn't it burn?
- Whose ways? SHIELD? - No. Their way is what got us here. - You started this war. This war started decades ago, when SHIELD was founded to guard the world against people like us.
I'm only going to hunt a truck. Whoever drove that truck is a man that needs questioning. Good night. And how do you plan to find it? I held on to the vita-ray detector from project rebirth.
I'm gonna kill you! Take your shot. Come on! Come on! This city doesn't deserve a better tomorrow. It deserves to drown... in its filth!
The last one came within 50 meters of a school. Your troops have killed over a dozen Palestinians in house raids. - You expect us not to fight back? - We need the violence to stop. If it continues, the peacekeeping mission will fall apart.
What's this got to do with anything in my juris-- You talk so much and say so little. I found the truck. It has an eagle-shaped hood ornament. I spoke to a rest stop waitress who had seen it.
You talk so much and say so little. I found the truck. It has an eagle-shaped hood ornament. I spoke to a rest stop waitress who had seen it. It was abandoned three days ago.
Turn around. Fine. I hate this. Now, even if you wanted to kill someone with a guitar, you would naturally grab it by the neck, not the body. But let's just assume that it was used that way.
You're going home? Well, then I'll send them out myself. Because tomorrow... This is happening. 4:00 p.m. sharp. I have a meeting at 4:00.
I think we should say lowell killed himself. The real killer is a zombie. Anyone on blaine's trail will be in danger And we can't warn them. And if they do manage to catch him, Then there's the whole zombie-in-a-prison problem. And then there's the body.
Thanks. No problem. This is the ring we sent you a picture of. It was my grandmother's. Anne's dad gave it to me to propose with.
Where does this leave us? I guess that depends on whether you still believe we want the same thing. The machine they're building. What is it? You want goodwill, let's start there.
You were... distraught, rightfully, and your brain scans showed abnormalities. Whether that was the radiation, I don't know. But your behavior was erratic, Molly. You can't deny it. Oh, I'll show you erratic, you keep lying. We had the boy's body in the morgue.
Alper? - Yes? I saw Kurd's ghost. You saw Kurd's ghost? It was in front of my cabin.
- Yes? I saw Kurd's ghost. You saw Kurd's ghost? It was in front of my cabin. I went out and it disappeared.
With all that expensive stained glass? Because I remember a day in that chapel. Damn you, Henry! Damn you! Father told me that that chapel wasn't built only for you, but also for me.
That depends. What do you know about immigration law? What, are we talking visas, or are you trying to process a labor certification? You know about immigration law? Doesn't everybody? Okay, tough guy, what do you think about my strategy on this?
- a dangerously ambitious man. - I read your letter. I wrote that letter thinking I'd never see you again. None of us are responsible for our hearts... only our actions. I do read Henry's bible.
- Nothing. The meat's well cooked. That's nice, but it's not true. I'm having problems with the oven. It doesn't heat well.
What were you thinking about? A dream. What dream? I've had it here and there for about six months. I'm walking in the woods, carrying a body.
Come here. You have to remind yourself. It's the disease. Remember what the dementia does? It gives you delusions.
No! Get away! - My son! - It's empty. - My son! - It's empty! The stroller is empty!
There's a bomb! Blow it up! Blow it up! Blow it up! Blow it up! Blow it up! Blow it up!
And as the ruler of a Protestant country allied with England, she would no longer be a threat to Elizabeth. Do you honestly believe that I would give up my kingdom, my wife? Surrender now and Mary will live. Your plan relies on the cooperation of a fickle English queen who does not take kindly to the advice of others.
Get the hell away from me! Get away from me! Get away! No! - Please tell me you have the camera. - What's wrong?
The Machine is here. It's here because it's everywhere. What do you mean, Harry? Two years ago, when the Machine moved itself, it didn't go to a data farm. It went into the wires.
Yes. Yes, I think we are. Welcome to the family. How'd you like that drink? I liked it.
But you're not the heir to the throne anymore. What happened on that phone call? What changed everything? This pendant. It's not mine.
Liz, I know a lot more about reddington than you think. The bullet nicked the right lung. I was able to re-inflate it with a chest tube, And will start him on a prophylactic antibiotic. What about the bullet? That's the problem.
The bullet nicked the right lung. I was able to re-inflate it with a chest tube, And will start him on a prophylactic antibiotic. What about the bullet? That's the problem. It has a percussion cap, Which causes it to essentially explode.
Mr. Zane, you scheduled this hearing. We've been waiting ten minutes. I'm not waiting any longer. Uh, you don't have to, your honor. My motion is here.
This is pointless! Just let me go in and talk! They've executed my men. Where are the Zygons? We need to bomb the hell out of this place.
And we ran her prints, but they're not on file. We've got our teams out there searching the woods, but we found these tucked into her bra. $50 bill, key card, and a cash receipt. From a coffee shop in the city, dated yesterday. This card looks like a hotel key.
Tell me, Doctor, who is... the Hybrid? Who threatens all of time and space? Oh, that's easy. That's very, very easy. The Hybrid... is you. 'I'm human, with a little bit of Mire inside me.' 'The Hybrid is supposed to be half Time Lord, half Dalek.'
That's where you were. You were trying to get me kicked out. You once said nobody knows anybody, right? So maybe you're the reason why we're here, and maybe everyone will learn about the real Simon Asher once and for all now that I know they should, too, right? Eh, mahal? The new agent review board investigates any and every breach of the Nat code of conduct.
Well, technically, you didn't lie. You withheld. And withholding can compromise any one of you as an agent. Any secret, no matter how small, can be used as a weapon by someone who wants something from you. This scar isn't a secret. It's a reminder of who I used to be.
The FBI's always on alert. What, the standard "if you see something, say something"? That's not gonna cut it here, Liam. Whatever the FBI is doing, it's not enough. The real bomber is inside the Bureau.
You saw what happened. The dust conglomerates. It moulds itself into a humanoid form. It's adaptable. It's clever.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Calm down, Swan. I'm not proposing. You know I'm a survivor. This ring is why. I've had it for many years.
You were right, Hiccup. Fighting dirty isn't me. - That was me. - It sure was. The Quaken was just being defensive. It was scared and all by itself.
And be careful! We all remember what these guys' stings can do to you. You don't have to remind me. I know exactly what they can do. This plan is insane. You know that, right?
She had good style, and I'm sure that a couple of her dresses are in a closet somewhere. I'm curious. What do you think of this color? It's great, actually, super vivid. It'll totally make your eyes pop.
No one's gonna stop me from killing him... Not in 6 months, not in 6 weeks... Now. Twins are the lifeblood of the Gemini coven. If a pregnant mother is in danger, then the transfer is our magical failsafe.
In the new year, you will return to your captain, and he will welcome you with open arms, and, detective, you will remember today as your darkest day. Tomorrow will be better, the day after better still. You will go on. Give me the bad news, doc. Aya's stake was cursed.
Hook... Killian... Whatever deal you made to get your revenge on Gold, it's not worth it. The darkness is using you. It doesn't care what you want.
So Crane found old paper, but the ink is fake. No, the ink is iron gall from iron salts and tannic acids. Which was the standard in Europe from the fifth to the 19th century. But the signature is fake? No.
- Yavuz. Damn it, it's Yavuz! Yavuz, you look like a tough young man. You're scared, but you look tough. The human soul is corrupt. It only worships power.
Yavuz, you look like a tough young man. You're scared, but you look tough. The human soul is corrupt. It only worships power. It keeps searching for new things to worship.
Hey, what'd I miss? Now it's personal. How did a werewolf get a pilot's license? It's got the intelligence of a man. Yeah, but you'd think when it applied for a license... somebody would have said something.
They invented the concept the same way Hallmark invented Mother's Day. Hallmark invented Mother's Day? Not even. You are a schmuck. Hold my drink. - Hey. I wanted to return your cassette.
No good. It's gym clothes. Gym clothes are evolving too. You really are stubborn. If you want beauty, printed rayon bare jersey will have bright and beautiful colors.
Holy crap. I just did that. Take this away. The Darkness is coming. It's so peaceful.
No, look, I know. She's The Machine. She's the... What? Oh, that's what we call her over there... "The Machine."
Help me hook this up. Uh-oh. What? Well, did you see this sticker? What is it?
It's 7:45 p.m. Are you 90? Rough day is all. I'm going to remind you of something, son, something you already know. The world ain't all Dilly Bars and debutante balls. The world throws wicked punches.
I stopped walking around naked about 20 years ago. And started cross-dressing? Work? Yeah. A body was found on parklands in western Virginia.
I like the intimate scenes between Mulder and Scully that bring us closer together, adding to the history of the series. Listen to me -- as your friend and as a physician, you are on dangerous ground here. I know what I'm doing. You could possibly make 12 different shows out of this show. It's a very flexible frame in terms of tonality, in terms of action, in terms of mythology, in terms of subject matter.
God be with you and watch over you. Thank you. This bird is no good. I tell you, no good! The priest won't accept it.
She wasn't who I thought she was. She was complicated. Complicated? The dark dimension is volatile. Dangerous.
Um, who's Paul? Sorry, "the Prince." "Then, he leaned in to kiss her, and finally said..." Oh, that's rich. How does the story end?
I know. Father... I noticed the tower. Impressive. I built it for you.
Time is against you, and you're being careless with it. I once believed I could do as many as six impossible things... before breakfast. That is a child's dream, Alice. The Wonder is just a ship. It's not just a ship.
We must follow the Word of God over the rule of men. We will not keep this good news quiet. And if that means we must leave... ..then leave we shall. My family feels an unspeakable joy at the hope of Christ's return. We feel love, the love of Jesus. It...it lifts us up, it carries us forward.
What? I love this sweater. I don't know why you would. This sweater goes with everything. It's a neutral.
All right, where are we going? Where are we going? This is the one. Right here. What's the number? 4-5-5-2-3-4-5-B. That number does not exist.
Command one to dispatch. Suspects in sight. Damn it! Delta, check the stairs to the north. There's a small gray door down here.
They like to kick you when you're down. That hardly seems fair. No, it really isn't. Do you know when the voice is gonna speak? Sometimes.
NEWT: But I think it might be the reason that the Demiguise is here. (CHUCKLES) Its sight operates on probability, so it can foresee the most likely immediate future. TINA:
Bupkis. We're never making it to Te Fiti. This mission is cursed. It's not cursed. Shark head.
It's gotta be, right? - The Zafiro Añejo? - Yeah. - That's correct, believe it or not. - Holy shit, a $50 shot of tequila?
Fortunately, Jared had selected his servants with care, so we had no worries regarding their trustworthiness. Even after several weeks, Paris itself remained an endless source of fascination. As I gazed upon the quaint city streets, I found it hard to believe that in a mere 40 years, the French Revolution would turn them into rivers of blood. The last time I had been here was during the delirious celebration marking the end of the Second World War. I had hoped to climb to the top of the Eiffel Tower, but the Nazis had closed it during the occupation, and it had yet to reopen.
You can have it. It's a cursed hat. - Cursed? - Yes. On the contrary, this hat brings good luck.
It's a cursed hat. - Cursed? - Yes. On the contrary, this hat brings good luck. It's saved several lives.
- Good evening, Mr Mercier. - Good evening, Mr President. Have a seat. - There's a reward. - I don't want it. Since you don't want the reward, let me tell you a secret. I lost this hat in Lyons.
The cut-off date is the 25th? - Right. Let's take a round and start with Legal. - Yes, we've... - We have a new supplier contract. Let's pass it around.
He was my first cousin, but I practically raised that boy. I loved him. So when you got here was the door locked? There is a code on the VIP entrance. It keeps the paparazzi away.
A race of workers and those, who keep. Any hope of peace has long been forgotten, lost time. I see two Noides, fleeing Subterra-3. - Confirmation of the application. - Confirmation!
Deputy Mayor, we all know why you're supporting the regeneration of the port. Because I'm on the Port Committee. Marseille has to move with the times. There's a gulf between your generation and today's generation. You should no longer have a say. This is a city that has to modernize.
We will ask them to provide us with local phones. You know but, my apps can become very useful. Such as? My diary. April 14th... Arrivals hall, immigration line. The line is... lethargic.
Not exactly evidence. You used it to exonerate a client. You used falsified evidence to exonerate a client. Mm, I think you're splitting hairs. I'm not splitting hairs. What if Davis Main find out you faked evidence?
- You are such an asshole. - Why? For pointing out her one mistake was believing in you? Chrissake, can we get some perspective here? It was a simple little commercial.
- Why? For pointing out her one mistake was believing in you? Chrissake, can we get some perspective here? It was a simple little commercial. It aired once, that's all.
It's not dead. Nurse? Is it wise to administer a hypertonic saline to a cardiac arrest patient? Agent Scully, we had to confirm your mother's advance directive, and it indicates that she not be resuscitated if unconscious or requires artificial respiration. She amended it last year.
From the beginning. Why start a fight you can't win? Because Orus is dead... and father, destroyed. Because of you. Your body will settle in time.
[Growling] Run. - What? - Run. He's telling us to run. Tropical Storm Hunter is moving up the southern coast of Thailand.
Danger danger. No, no, no! We're going back to plan A. We're telling your mom. Take a look at this beaut. Should've seen it when I got it.
I imagine it must have looked just like that piece of felt. He ran. Never saw a thing as beautiful as that old dog... running. Until, at last, he finally caught it. And to the horror of everyone, he killed that little cat.
What do you guys call it? Us guys? Don't give me shit, Koen. Your people. The Namorrodor.
I did. What's it like up there? The sun was out. You gotta get my ring. I stashed it up there when he brought me in.
You rock that jewelry real well. You know, that's how we met. I'm a jewelry designer. - Oh. - And Butch, that boy loved his bling. Oh, yeah? Did you make Dr. Ronald's tongue ring, too?
Last season on Penny Dreadful... Do you believe the past can return? It never leaves us.
There's a lot for people to be upset about right now. This... this is... this is all the more reason to stand behind your chancellor. I got to go. Here. So the bug's in place?
But you have to be very quiet or you'll scare them off. I know that. - Shall we go? - Yes! Have you ever seen a fairy?
-No. -Good. Your female instinct, what does it tell you? I don't have one. Of course you do.
That took Shepard, took Grissom. That cannot take Glenn. Now, the Atlas rocket... that can push us into orbit. Goes up, delivers the capsule into an elliptical orbit. Earth's gravity keeps pulling at it but it's going so fast, it keeps missing the Earth.
How am I supposed to see? Well, therein lies the beauty. Two-way mirrors, just like the cops use, huh? I don't know, I don't know. That chemical plant...
Rise up! Go into those dark streets you know so well, those foul alleys and secret back lanes and find me a bad man! A faithless husband. A cruel lover. A rich despot. A scrofulous john fucking some girl just like you, and quick with the back of his hand while he's at it. Find him and bring me his right hand! Yes!

Each night, the teenage Chimera... The success. This teenager goes out into the night and transforms. Whether it's a young man or young woman, they become a werewolf. A very large, very powerful werewolf the people of Gevaudan called The Beast. Every night it transforms, it remembers a little more of who it used to be.
I can go check the crime scene for any leftover evidence. You should go to Starling General and have that looked at. I'll be fine. Because eating a cheeseburger is a better option? This isn't for me.
And today, we get to take another step towards that goal. As you know, battery technology has been at a virtual standstill for decades, with batteries lasting, nor charging any faster than they did in the 1970s. Until now. Today Palmer Tech is pleased to introduce the Power Cell, a 100% recyclable battery. It can charge an electric car for thousands of miles.
You channeled your grief and became the Black Canary, but Sara's not dead anymore. Maybe you owe it to yourself to pursue the path you were on. You're serious? This city has enough heroes with masks on. With Ruvé Darhk as mayor, it needs a hero without a mask.
Turn it off. Those missiles hit, and he's going to become even stronger, isn't he? He already is with the souls of all of those Argus agents that he just killed. Wait. I'm in. I'm through Cooper's firewalls.
Truth be told, it's not dissimilar to the plan I had for the glades once upon a time, but on a much, much larger scale. Let me guess... You don't think that destroying the entire world is completely insane? The world is what's insane. It is beyond saving.
She wasn't wrong. Your feelings may not have changed, but mine have. I've been lying to myself, trying to hold on. But the part of me that loved you, the part of me that hoped for your redemption... That part was human.
Just gonna wait for someone to show up order a pizza. Fred—are you excited about the preview tomorrow? I wish I had another week to edit. I think I could make it perfect. Stop it.
- Cathy will negotiate on my behalf. - I don't trust her on this. That's a risk we'll have to take. The risk I won't take is being overseas if the president dies. We don't even know if Congress will approve the appropriation for the bailout.
- Yeah, but... You're not gonna believe this. Holy shit. Why are the Yakuza digging a hole? Give me the flashlight.
Some bloody their fists trying to keep the Kitchen safe. Others bloody the streets in the hope they can stop the tide, the crime, the cruelty... the disregard for human life all around them. But this is Hell's Kitchen. Angel or devil, rich or poor, young or old, you live here. You didn't choose this town.
Good God. Cheers. - This have a lid? - There isn't one. The Niffin becomes fused with the wood.
Friendship, that's all that matters. [Maria] No friend left behind. That was the answer. If only I had known that in the past. I love my new Maria Bamford Pepper Stepper Pepper-bot.
We stop here. All right. This is where we split up. The entrance to the tunnel is right over there. Yeah.
- You robbed me of her. - Griffin. Stop talking. So I can concentrate. Wake up, man. This city is screwed up because of you.
Right now, as I sit in this chair, in this office, where so many of my predecessors have steered our nation through turbulent times... I realize that this job is one that transcends politics and rhetoric. Entrusted to anyone who sits behind this desk is something far more elemental, the very survival of our nation. And I, as your president, must confront the storm before us. That storm is terror. More dangerous and unpredictable than any hurricane.
Entrusted to anyone who sits behind this desk is something far more elemental, the very survival of our nation. And I, as your president, must confront the storm before us. That storm is terror. More dangerous and unpredictable than any hurricane. It has endangered us abroad.
I abandoned him. I let my brother drown so I could save myself. So that's why you're hallucinating him? Because some faux version of your brother is upset with something that you did in a fake reality? The hellstone is trying to tell me something.
Oh, my God, you're insane. You actually think that you can beat her. Hey, Marina's strong, but so are we. Nothing like that at school, huh? Protection charm.
- Your dress is stunning. - Thank you. I feel more nervous wearing that dress than I ever have on the battlefield. I think that's pretty normal. Lydia, I need to talk to you about something. What is it? Valentine sent a Shax demon to track us on our mission today.
That was a gemstone? Well, it's more than a gemstone... it's also like a kind of onboard computer. Come here. Can you see... Can you see that little yellow star at the end of that curve?
Shall we dance? - We still got it. Mi amor... There was a tunnel under the barn. We never figured out where it led to.
I destroyed the quill. Oh, yes, yes, I know what you did. We hear it all down here. But I'm guessing you don't know much about the quill, do you? The sorcerer bequeathed the quill to all of you, but it is not a simple pen. It is a magical energy. It is a living, breathing entity.
But I'm guessing you don't know much about the quill, do you? The sorcerer bequeathed the quill to all of you, but it is not a simple pen. It is a magical energy. It is a living, breathing entity. It's alive? Oh, yes. And when you broke it, Henry, you sent it right down here to the Underworld, its purpose unfulfilled.
It's the WMD team. The bomb is gone. Response team confirms... It's gone. The terrorist took it.
Previously on "The Flash"... Barry, what you're seeing is the Speed Force... Your past, your present, your future. Say, Iris, you look amazing. Thanks, Tony. His skin changed.
I'm sitting at the entrance to the garage when I realize I don't have my key card. I gotta drive all the way home to get it. When I got there, I couldn't find it anywhere. Suddenly, I remember: I put it in the glove compartment.
You're worse than my husband! I can do this all day, sugar lips. It's him. Welcome to my cabin in the woods. It is.
Do you think you can do it? We can't stop Myriad's signal, but we can piggyback off of it. We're lucky. This TV station is old. Not that old. Not old-old.
- Batman. Brainiac has already won, we've been bottled. But, how did you get here? Time sphere. The Legion has only one that wasn't destroyed when Brainiac took over.
Yes, I--I do. There's the moment when you realize you love a woman, and the moment you realize you're gonna marry her. I want to hear about the second one. It was the end of last year. I'd gotten in late from a case.
4th of July in 1961. It's not possible. But it is. You're holding it. Tell me about the film you saw.
I would've stopped him. But I couldn't. I was asleep. You didn't think the war was right? I never really thought about it being right or wrong.
If you say you need him, you must need him. I'll have RT stop by. Son, y'all know y'all can't jump. I tracked the last package to the Midtown post office it was mailed from. However, there's no evidence on the security footage of anyone mailing it from inside the station.
- Watch it on the right. - Jesus! Watch it. No, no, no! This road is not closed.
Okay, I got it. Here it is. Look at the, uh, date on the back. - Oh! And Lorelai... - Huh? The virus protection software I told you about. Want me to pop it on your computer?
- Eat me! Nice to see you, Francie. I miss Doyle. Calm down. I miss the sex.
Nobody is named Kinky Boots! -This is not right. -No. I saw the show twice. The Stars Hollow Gazette cannot just go down. I mean, it's not Spotlight at the Boston Globe.
- You know? - Yes. The fucking red tape. Money, money, always money. I know. Beppi wants me to come back, to go on tour, to do this concert, to be La Fiamma again, because of the money. How is the pasta?
_ JEN: I'm telling you, there's a rat in the attic. I can hear it.
You guys go ahead. Rizzoli. ‭Isles. Yeah, I got it. ‭Okay. We'll be right there. What about your surgery?
I know. I'm not saying that because you said something nice about me. Really, like, you... are you sure that you're okay? You know, the surgery went well. I feel pretty good.
- Do you know where we can find him? - I'm sorry. I mean, he died. Uh, like I said, he was a senior board member. Does anybody else know the story? I hope not.
- Hey. - Hey. Oh, so did you go with the dark roast? Mm-hmm. It's great with the hazelnut cream. I really love that.
Aye-aye, captain. I am on it. Angie, found the murder weapon. It's a high-end ice Axe. Yikes.
The files from France? Aubrey asked me to look into Chadwick Grey, the guy from the Gem Society who put the microscopic code on the diamonds. And? And... before he worked at the Gem Soc, he sold jewelry in Paris at the first shop robbed by the Marquise. We looked into Mr. Grey. You used to work selling jewelry, and the last place you worked was robbed by thieves going after historical knock-off jewels. That robbery is what made me want to help secure such items.
Hi, Patrick. Chef, a word, please. It's cool, it's cool. My product... I need it back. Don't worry about it.
- Fascinating. Which is why you'll keep what I'm about to tell you a secret. Even from the rest of your team. The ATOM suit is made of and powered by dwarf star alloy. It's strong enough to withstand bullets, arrows, and explosives.
I've got it. I've almost got it. I've got him. That pod... It's identical to mine.
I like that he's there for you. I like that he's doing this even though he doesn't have to. Call him again. He's not much of a phone-answerer, in my experience. Once we plug in the machine, everything will become clear, I'm sure of it. You don't even know what it does.
He's not much of a phone-answerer, in my experience. Once we plug in the machine, everything will become clear, I'm sure of it. You don't even know what it does. Well, I mean, clearly, it... clarifies everything? Show me.
You were there, you're one of the original souls. Why is it, do you think, that Rainey didn't let us build another altar? Had us holed up in some rotted-out mansion basement, had us in some decrepit zoo building? It's so he could control it. The altar is sacred--
Who asked you to investigate Touvier? The prosecutor to the Court of Security. What for? I'd like to see your report. It's confidential.
He's coming. - Hi! - Hi. I love your movie. Well, thanks.
- She's got you there. - I know. - Dad? - I love this town. I absolutely love it.
Are you leaving now? Why would I stay? Here is a letter. I found it among Miss Bai's things. Sorry,
No. I don't know you. There are stages to a demonic possession, my friend. Right now, my guess... the demon's gone possum. Gathering its strength, waiting to show its ratty little teeth.
Electrifying! James comes from a world where he wants his phone and his camera separate. "I like a paper diary." This Mazda is a smartphone. It does everything.
That's brainwashing. What do you think was in that injector? My free will. I don't think so. That medicine wasn't meant for you.
What do you think was in that injector? My free will. I don't think so. That medicine wasn't meant for you. It's messing with your mind.
Everything is fine. Trust me. Trust me. It's okay. Cássia, I'm already fixing the alarm.
- Untraceable. - He's playing with us. He called me to brag while we watched her burn. Scorsese, were you able to recover anything else from the victim? I found the SD card from Hannah's bag.
If only it were that easy. It doesn't have to be so difficult. Commodus, the people of Rome, they're just like you. They want to see an end to this war. I've heard it in the streets every day.
Douche on the loose. With four contenders duking it out for top spot, here's a fifth to add to the mix. This time, the focus is on me. This invention has taken the world by storm in just the last couple of years. You'll see it at any tourist landmark.
He just slapped me across the face and I thought, "Okay, I'll just have to go through with this." [whistling stops] Going within someone else's body, I mean... uninvited, you know, [stammers] it's just huge. And I survived 'cause I took my mind away. I thought, "You can never, ever harm my essence, my spirit. My body is only part of me.
It was built on the site of the very first sector of the wall that was pulled down. The tooth, huh? All those people down there believed the wall was dividing the world. That East and West were separating people into "us" or "them." But the real division, the only one that has ever mattered, was never horizontal.
In Azeroth? In the barracks. One the bodies. Guardian, what is the Fel? A magic unlike any other.
In the barracks. One the bodies. Guardian, what is the Fel? A magic unlike any other. It feeds on life itself.
One the bodies. Guardian, what is the Fel? A magic unlike any other. It feeds on life itself. It pollutes the user, twisting everything it touches.
My family. I have done all I can to protect them. We have been surrounded by predators since the shipwreck. (INFANT CRYING) The jungle consumes everything.
Jesus Garcia. Queens. (DOG WHINES) Are you adopting a puppy, Mr. Harding? Yes, yeah.
Every time I go over it, what I did, the choices I made... I swear, I couldn't have done anything else. But that's not the point. I dealt with the problem. I just had no idea what the solution would do to me.
he signed up to donate his organs. One of which is a liver. Which is a perfect match for Terence. Exactly. His liver will never go to the national list.
Why are you so confident? It isn't confidence. Doubt leads to death. Tell me the legend again. Why are you so interested in hearing it?
Well, now he is returned. And Delaney's will leaves him everything. Including Nootka. Do we have a copy of the Nootka Sound treaty yet? Where perhaps our lawyers could pick it apart?
You're my bodyguard? That means you guard my body. Is that not right? Not when you're robbing a bank. At the moment, my body is going to the bank.
You think I'm any different than any other politician? I used to. Izzy, you been around long enough. You know what it is. I don't make the rules. The Brooks Innovation deal is changing the course of history in this city.
And to think all of this came out of your boring little Boy Scout brain. Actually, I have to say, I'm... I'm quite jealous. So all this is just a bunch of bullshit? Including the key? No, the key was real.
God damn it, Christopher. I told you to change that. Listen, I was right. You were wrong. Remember my bigfoot?
So I've been calling around about all of the hunters that died. Um, every one of them had years of experience. We got a letter from Eileen. Eileen? She sent it four days ago.
It'll be fine, honey. Okay... - Wow. - Alex? Signal's gone. Well, let's go back inside.
There's no reason to be sorry. Listen, I took one of the vibrators home and... Ah-ha! I think I know who took one of the vibrators. And love it. There's no other way to say it.
Okay, thank you. However... I found an extraordinarily high level of hyaluronidase in her system. - What's that? - Something found in bug saliva. I had to look it up, having never seen it before.
We can enter his home, steal whatever we need, - and leave before anyone notices. - Okay. You want me to help you rob the most deadly vampire on the planet? I will pass. If you're worried about a fight... allow me to even the odds. The stone is kyanite.
I don't know how to do it! I'll teach you, Dilaver. Now, stand up. Take off your clothes slowly. Don't be scared, Dilaver.
It's 175 more than you get from that Jag that James would be droning on about now, had I not stepped in and saved the day. And then there's the way it revs. Most turbocharged engines are a bit wheezy at the top end, but because the twin-scroll turbo in this is mounted in the V of the engine... just like it is in a Ferrari California, coincidentally, the rev counter is still a blur This engine is... it's a masterpiece. An absolute gem.

Oh, it is. So is a volcanic eruption or a tsunami. Few things are more beautiful than destruction, but doesn't mean I enjoy it. So this mist, you hope it'll disappear again? Yes, of course.
Nathalie, where is Link? All right, it's okay. You don't have to tell me, but... The mist came. It saved me.
We found Regina Franklin's parents in Tampa. I offered to fly down and talk to them personally, But apparently her mother has a cousin who lives here, So... we flew them up instead. Some cases end well and you can... forget about them. But some some become a part of who you are. This job is going to change you.
Uh, can you help me out? Okay, yeah, one second. Yeah? The body adapts. It protects itself.
Look, a stone cairn - Pictish civilisation. The bird! What about it? It said "dark". Yes, well that's why we're hurrying, because there's not much light at this time of day.
