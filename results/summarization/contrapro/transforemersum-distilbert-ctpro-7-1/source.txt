Got nothing to say? I'm not saying no. Obviously, it would be great. Let's talk about it over dinner tonight. A friendly dinner. We'll talk it over.
-What's this piece? -A popular Argentinean song. -It's nice. That's a costume I could wear. It'd be a change from feathers. They always cover me in them! This is too long.
It's not true! It wasn't me! It's a horrible accusation! Why did you arm yourself with a knife before going to the victim's dressing room? I wasn't armed with a knife, your Honor. I had it on me when I left my dressing room.
- The famous Beaugard, as promised. How can I ever express my gratitude? - Oh, 'tis nothing. Nothing? You return from Europe with a masterpiece worth $100,000, and instead of displaying it yourself, you let me unveil it at my party for Captain Spaulding. You call that nothing? - Mrs. Rittenhouse, I...
Hooray, hooray, hooray. My friends, I'm highly gratified of this display of effusion. And I want you to know... My friends, I'm highly gratified of this display of effusion... My friends, I'm highly gratified of this display of effusion. Hooray for Captain Spaulding...
No secret. It's Beaugard's "After the Hunt". The original? - Most original. Be careful. Where did she get that?
It's Beaugard's "After the Hunt". The original? - Most original. Be careful. Where did she get that? Is it very valuable?
Maybe for a few years. Before I get married, I'm gonna sow a couple of wild oats. The Captain's so amusing. - Isn't he charming? That's the famous Beaugard, eh? Great picture, isn't it?
I'll show it to you sometime. Listen. - What? - Mother's going to unveil it tonight. Yeah? Suppose when she unveils it, it's not the Beaugard at all.
What's the matter with you? Flash. Before the people are coming. What's a matter? You lose it? You gotta find it.
- Wait. Something might happen. We'd all enjoy a few words from Mr. Chandler, who will tell us something of Beaugard's life and work. And keep it clean! Mr. Chandler! My friends, you are all familiar with Beaugard. This is perhaps his masterpiece.
The last time they suspected me, I got four years. - Hives! You give me the painting, and I'll take care of it. - Good. Good heavens. It's gone. - Gone?
I was busy all morning. - You've got to return that painting. Painting? What painting? The painting you changed last night. You mean the piksh? - Yes.
How dull you turned out to be! Let me see that a minute. It's signed "Beaugard". There's the criminal. No. Beaugard is dead. Dead?
Tree? That's a spinach. - It can't be. Where's the egg? It could be spinach. Look at all the sand.
Hey, Capt! It come to me like a flash! This painting wasn't stolen. It has disappeared. Yes, disappeared. And you know what make it disappear? Moths!
Plenty. But I gotta kill me a pair of skunks, back apiece on the road to Santa Fe. Hey, wait, wait. Friend, how do you find that valley? Wellmore here is sending a bull train clear through to old Tom Williams's trading post. First time it's ever been tried.
There's nothing to explain. But I'm gonna tell you anyhow. It seems to me you're forcing yourself on this lady. Is that how it seems to you? How else can I take it? It's nothing to me how you take it.
It seems to me you're forcing yourself on this lady. Is that how it seems to you? How else can I take it? It's nothing to me how you take it. But it matters a heap to me, ma'am, how you understand. Perhaps not.
Well, he's saying that I'm your squaw. Seems like that's what he's driving at. Well, you tell him that you don't want me for your squaw. I've never told Black Elk a lie yet. He knows my tongue is straight. Well, what do you mean?
Well, just as long as it takes to fix up the outfit. Bascom, you tell them pilgrims of yours, there's 500 miles of desert ahead of us and them that don't like what's comin' to them, now's the time for 'em to turn back. Yes, sir, that pork is nearly done right now. Shank me off a snack! Get out of there. Fine piece of beef. Ah!
Well, tear him down yourself. Oh, I'd like to kick him into pulp. Oh, I'd like to break him in two like a... Well, why not? I don't mind fists or feet, or even a gun. It's the way he throws that knife.
Don't panic! Looks like Crows and Cheyennes, Zeke. Yeah. Now let's throw it into 'em! Stop shooting', everybody! Stop shooting'! They're ridin' off.
God bless my sister Ruth and my brother Dave, and make me a good girl, and take care of us. Aren't you going to ask God to take care of Breck Coleman? Oh, Zeke says that Breck Coleman can take care of himself. You overplayed your hand that time, Lopez! Zeke, this is old Ben Griswell's knife. Well, where'd you find it, boy?
Aren't you going to ask God to take care of Breck Coleman? Oh, Zeke says that Breck Coleman can take care of himself. You overplayed your hand that time, Lopez! Zeke, this is old Ben Griswell's knife. Well, where'd you find it, boy? Lopez just left it sticking in my bedroll.
He's only a bit up in the timber there, and he's a-headed this way. Zeke, won't you stay over for the anniversary? Yes, gal, I'll stay. Aw! And I just recollected, I got a little present for you. Oh, Zeke, what is it? Well, a young fella named Breck Coleman left it with me, and he told me to give it to you in case he didn't show up. Where is it, Zeke?
Zeke, won't you stay over for the anniversary? Yes, gal, I'll stay. Aw! And I just recollected, I got a little present for you. Oh, Zeke, what is it? Well, a young fella named Breck Coleman left it with me, and he told me to give it to you in case he didn't show up. Where is it, Zeke? I hid it in the holler of the big tree at the bend of the trail.
For what then? I could eat something. Live well, I'm dying. Pears he has liked. Go ahead, read on, friend! The kulak Belokon sabotages our work, hides the seeds and kills the livestock..."
I could eat something. Live well, I'm dying. Pears he has liked. Go ahead, read on, friend! The kulak Belokon sabotages our work, hides the seeds and kills the livestock..." I'm not giving it away!
Comrade chairman, the tractor is standing still! The tractor has arrived, the whole village witnessed it. The tractor can't be standing still. Go! Go on then! Go!
- Good night. What's that? A letter. Who is it from? A friend. What's it about?
What's that? A letter. Who is it from? A friend. What's it about? It's about me.
Well, if you feel that way about it, that settles it. I'm not interested in your affairs. Far be it from me to read your private mail. With me it's a closed book. Finis. Never bring up the matter again.

- You believe me, Olga? - I want to believe you. What's that? What you got there, Joe? What are you doing with that? Can't you forget you've seen it?
Well, gee, I... - I'll be working New Year's Eve. - Now, listen, Joe. This is the joint where you're working. And don't you be forgetting it, either. Come on in.
Give them the shaft. I'll be in here listening. Happy New Year, boys. Say, there's a lonesome touring car down the street. I was wondering if you happened to know anything about it. How should I know anything about it?
That hearse is sure decked out pretty. Well, this was no time to be tight with money. Tony deserved a swell send-off. - Poor kid. - Yeah, but Rico's wreath beat them all. It was big.
Let's have it! Arnie you're through. You hire these mugs, they miss. Now you're through. If you ain't out of town by tomorrow morning you won't ever leave it except in a pine box. I'm taking over this territory.
I bet all this trick furniture set you back plenty, huh? Well, they don't exactly give it away with cigar coupons. Well, I'll tell the world. Boy, it sure look... Oh, look at that. - Do you like it?
- Joe! - There he is, the dirty double-crosser. Give it to him, Rico! No. Shoot. Shoot, Rico.
Scream your head off! Here. Think you can run home and rat on me to Franz? "Reinhold tried to kiss me, and I let him have it!" Let me go! You swine!
We got knocked down, but we got right back up. You can see that my right arm's gone, yet here I stand tall on my own two feet! The Berolina Statue, the old symbol of Berlin, high above the Alexanderplatz ― they tore it down. It's no longer standing. Why? It was metal on the outside, but hollow inside. But... this little gizmo here ― this gave me the idea. They can knock it down and turn it on its head ― it always gets back on its feet. That's right.

Think about it, folks.
- Did you write this? - Yes. Your own composition, eh? I don't use invisible ink. What do you call this masterpiece? I haven't named it yet.
Everything will be ready. I hope you will find this comfortable. Thanks. It looks very inviting. Oh, it's nothing serious. Just a small cut from that paper clip.
Count Dracula's just taken Carfax Abbey. Oh, it'll be a relief to see light in those dismal old windows. It will, indeed. You'll excuse me, I'm wanted on the telephone. The Abbey could be very attractive, but I should imagine it would need quite extensive repairs. I shall do very little repairing.
Please! Please don't, Master! I lay in bed for quite a while, reading. And just as I was commencing to get drowsy, I heard dogs howling. And when the dream came, it seemed the whole room was filled with mist. It was so thick, I could just see the lamp by the bed, a tiny spark in the fog. And then I saw two red eyes staring at me, and a white livid face came down out of the mist.
Well, what's he done to you, dearie? Tell me. He came to me. He opened a vein in his arm and he made me drink... What is it? Who is it, Martin?
This is Professor Van Helsing. Van Helsing, the distinguished man of science whose fame is known even in the mountains of Transylvania. Doctor, I beg you to excuse me, but your daughter had better go to her room immediately. Aren't you feeling well? I hope it's nothing serious. I had a terrible dream a few nights ago and I haven't been able to get it out of my mind.
I can hardly believe it! You look like a different woman. Darling, you look terrific! And I feel terrific. But it's stuffy in here. And that smell.
Why? Your eyes. They look at me in such a strange way! Eva, my daughter! It's all right, Eva, my love. The cross.
Watch. Take care now, Frankenstein. Shut out the light. Sit down. Go and sit down. - It understands this time.
I said beat it! Pardon me. What did you say? I said beat it! He said beat it. Gee, I wish I'd said that.
Where were you before you came here? – At my aunt's At your aunt's? Full of holes My aunt thought it would do And what do you think?

I wonder how long we're going to be in here. Oh, about two months, I guess. Gee. That's a month apiece. [ Ollie ] 'A month apiece'! You can take it from me. When I get out, I'm going back on the farm. Boy, there's the life.
What do you guys want? Get back to your desks. Go back to work. Don't tell me you were drunk and don't remember. - Or is it one of Bingy's snowstorms? - It's true all right.

- No, sir. - Yes. - Have you looked in the closets? - Yes, sir. - Found no skeletons? - No, sir.
And while we're on the subject, I wish you'd try to stay home a little more. - I gotta work, ain't I? - Sure. Listen, I was in a place today, and I heard somebody say something. - What of it? - Well, they were saying...
He's one of Paddy Ryan's gang. But that's not all. Sure, they stop at nothing. You either take their beer, or they put you on the spot. I tell you, Michael, it is a wicked business. Why, only last week...
But that's not all. Sure, they stop at nothing. You either take their beer, or they put you on the spot. I tell you, Michael, it is a wicked business. Why, only last week... - Got it?
Yes. You see, I came home from the dance with it hidden under my wrap... for fear someone would take it from me. Well, Joan, if we weren't such good friends, I'd say... You'd say what? I won't say it. Oh, Bill.
Well, Joan, if we weren't such good friends, I'd say... You'd say what? I won't say it. Oh, Bill. If you'd wanted something all your life and fate laid it right in your palm? What would you do?
Help! Hello, Hank. Do you want me? Yeah, Billy. Here's that piece of cheese. They call it "The Stolen Jools".
Hello, Hank. Do you want me? Yeah, Billy. Here's that piece of cheese. They call it "The Stolen Jools". Take it away before the Board of Health gets here.
Oh, well, some dance and some die. And some will do both. - Is that it? - I think it is, General Shubin. - May I? - Surely.
You love that boy, and I know it. Would I have taken this if I loved him? What is it? Photographs of his dispatches to Russia. Doesn't that convince you? Yes, I'm quite convinced.
- And, oh, the things we'll see together. - Don't, please. - What? - I don't want to frighten you, but... What is it? It would be glorious to go with you but I may never be able to see all those splendid things.
What a perfect gentle knight you are, commander. Good evening. Like to see a ship we were once passengers in? I called you gordon. Why, that's a christian name, too. Yes. I liked it.
It's all right. Thanks. What's more, keep up the good work, and who knows, someday you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk. Not a bad thought, eh? What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.
- Hello, Mayme, this is Gerda again. - Almonds to you. Say, listen, I just heard something that'll make your head swim. Listen to this, the bank was robbed last night. Yeah, over $100,000. Who did it?
Mother just told me. I just heard it. Bank's broke. Hurry up. - Closing your account? - Yes, sir.
I can't tell you. Listen, if I get them out of the room, will you tell me? No, I won't. - You're protecting somebody. - No, I'm not. It doesn't matter who it is.

-We went walking. -Go on, walk. Okay, skipper. And then we came to a park. Only there was a tremendously large yellow moon up in the sky. It was altogether too big and too bright.
-Was she here again? -Yes, she was here again. -She's living now with her sister, you know? -Her sister? -l thought it was her aunt. -Maybe you are right. Maybe it was her aunt.
You mustn't talk like that. You seem to be in an awful hurry. Well, I ain't exactly got a lot of time on my hands. I have. That's your bedroom? Yes. Want to see it?
I've laid the groundwork. I know the exact position of her room. I've made friends with her ballet master, Pimenov. Listen, Heinrich. I've taken all my savings, everything... and I'm going to enjoy spending it. All of it. It's terribly expensive here, Heinrich.
Yes, head porter. Yes. What? - Yes. - What's the matter? The child has come.
Oh, is that what I stepped in? At least you could have cleaned them. - The trustees have a few suggestions. I think you know what the trustees can do with their suggestions. "I don't know what they have to say, it makes no difference anyway, Whatever it is, I'm against it.

Now, on closer examination... This needs closer examination. In fact, it needs a nightgown. Baravelli, who did this? Is this your picture? It doesn't look like me.

Get him out of here, will you? Why did you get off the boat at all? You know it doesn't stop here again for four weeks, don't you? Sure, I do. Think I'm overjoyed about it? But it's just got to be, that's all. - Well then? - I left the boat here for the same reason I took it at Saigon. - What reason?
- He's through it. Oh, gee, that's swell. He's such a nice kid. Say, what's this? Some new kind of an alarm clock? It doesn't seem to ring or tick at all. - Hey! It was a barometer!
All visible to the naked eye. Just pour in acetic acid. The more acid, the quicker the liquid rubber resents the insult, and stiffens up into an indignant mass. There. Crude rubber. Well, I can't believe it. But how does it...
Mac, Guidon and I are leaving in the morning. I asked Dennis if you could go along, darling. He says it's an awfully rotten area, even for a man. Gary... - Yes? - Maybe I... Well...maybe I'd better go.

- I never heard of it. You wouldn't, Kemp. It's never used now. I didn't know it was even made. It's a drug that's made from a flower that's grown in India. It draws colour from everything it touches. Years ago they tried it for bleaching cloth.
It's a drug that's made from a flower that's grown in India. It draws colour from everything it touches. Years ago they tried it for bleaching cloth. They gave it up because it destroyed the material. - That doesn't sound very terrible. - I know, but it does something else.
They gave it up because it destroyed the material. - That doesn't sound very terrible. - I know, but it does something else. It was tried out on some poor animal - a dog, I believe. It was injected under the skin, and it turned the dog dead white, like a marble statue. - Is that so?
A couple of drinks and a gust of wind. So much for you. Now then, about the bicycle. Where's the owner of the bicycle? Here, sir. It was pulled clean out of me hands, sir.

Take this down. "Number 5,673,210,109,212,003... Liliom Zadowski, here present... waives his right to return to Earth for one night." There's an error on the registration form of the man they sent down below. It's missing a stamp. It's management's fault.
Very well. Good day, sir. - We had a slight accident. - Oh really? You can fix it, can't you? No.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I didn't get it. You are a smartie. So this is your car? Okay.
I didn't get it. You are a smartie. So this is your car? Okay. But from now on, it's mine. Get it?
This is Jeannette. Take note of this. Green Studebaker, at the Longchamp Hermitage. License plate number... 98 82 RG5. ...82 RG5. Let's get to work!
Green Studebaker, at the Longchamp Hermitage. License plate number... 98 82 RG5. ...82 RG5. Let's get to work! It's a green Studebaker, at the Hermitage. The license plate number is 98 82 RG5.
It's a green Studebaker, at the Hermitage. The license plate number is 98 82 RG5. See how easy it is? Hurry up, for Christ's sake! It won't wait for you! Take that.

5% off when you pay, as usual. Great. See you in a bit. Where were we? Oh yeah... this is not a tea room. It's no tennis club either.
Bummer! Do you know Marseilles? Nice place. He's being picky. In any case, you'll take that car to Marseilles. And quick.
He's not there yet. I even wonder if he'll ever get there. I'm not superstitious, but I have a bad feeling. He likes speed and could be careless... and push that car... a little too much. Did you find it at an antique store? It was parked at the university.
- Because I've fallen in love with you. Now you may punish me for my effrontery. I deserve punishment far more than you do. We must never do this again. It's disloyal to my future husband. Disloyal?
Keep your eye on the store, Beamish, while I'm away. You can depend upon me, sir. - Hiya, Mr. Holt! - Hello, Edward. Where's Mr. Arlington? This is his luggage, but I think he's in his cabin.
Darling, you're very... Throw that down to me, Cheetah. Give that to me. Cheetah, that isn't funny. Throw it down to me, Cheetah. Can't you see I've got nothing on.
If I were, I should be back there. With Tarzan's memory. Answer me honestly, Jane. Would you feel better if we didn't take the ivory? If we carried it back? Martin, that's sweet of you... but nothing matters anymore.
That way. It's blocked. We'll save ourselves first. Cheetah can show us the way after. Come back here, you! Pick up that ivory.
Now look here, Charles, the both of us are going about this in the wrong way. I don't want to get tough with you. I'm sure you don't want to either. Just one more question I want to ask you. Are you willing to swear to a complaint for this guy's plugging you? That's another one I can't answer now.
Asta. Come here. You're a fine watchdog. He's got more sense than you have. I'm glad you're not on this case. On it?
So is mine. - What's the matter with you? - The mystery's all gone. - I was hoping you'd find out who did it. - Maybe I will. - If Wynant...
- Yes, but I couldn't find a thing. I figure it like this. Wynant went to Julia's apartment and found Morelli there. Sees she's two-timing him, there's a fight. He doesn't do anything because of Morelli. Lets his lawyer give her money to give to him so she'll think it's blown over.
Sees she's two-timing him, there's a fight. He doesn't do anything because of Morelli. Lets his lawyer give her money to give to him so she'll think it's blown over. Then when she isn't expecting it, he lets her have it. - No proof? - Nothing as yet to cinch it.
The first one might be the bad one. I'll have to look that up. You needn't bother looking that up. I'm not going to get married, and I'm not having any children. From now on, I'm just out for the ride. I took it from her hand.
Whoever killed him was counting on one thing... that skeletons all look alike. - Well, they do, don't they? - Sure. You won't get another swallow until you say. I happened to remember he had shrapnel in his shin. It bothered him.
At the end, where he can keep an eye on things. That's the place for him when the trouble starts. And the little friend of Nunheim's, the frying-pan juggler, there. Nick, are you sure one of these people is the killer? Positive. Nick, I can't stand the suspense.
Perhaps you'll tell us now why we're here. We're here because I have some very important news. What is it? Just this. Clyde Wynant did not kill Julia. He didn't kill Nunheim or anyone. What are you talking about?
- I feel almost myself again. When you're strong enough, we'll go away and forget this horrible experience. Forget? If only I could forget. But it's never out of my mind. I've been cursed for delving into the mysteries of life. Perhaps death is sacred, and I've profaned it.
I'll get her. I'll hold her down and there she'll be. Where, I ask you? Where will she be? A thousand crowns. It's beating perfectly. Just as in life.
Where, I ask you? Where will she be? A thousand crowns. It's beating perfectly. Just as in life. - Oh, if only I can keep it going until...
Where will she be? A thousand crowns. It's beating perfectly. Just as in life. - Oh, if only I can keep it going until... - It was a very fresh one.
Ј10, sold. What would you like done with him, Miss Bishop? Why, I don't know. You're extremely foolish. It might have cost you your life. It was fortunate for you that I was here to save you.
I'm not taking any chances by asking our medical friends for more. I told Nuttall we'd get to the boat by midnight. Jeremy, we must not fail tonight. What the devil have you been up to? Tonight will be a fine night, judging by the sky. There you are, Pitt.
I've seen swimmers in Dji... in Djibouti! Look at this beautiful grape. Here you go! Isn't she lovely! She swore she won't do it again. You won't do it again?
- Put new men into the boats. - Mr. Morrison, pipe the men. Change the boat crews. Dive in with your mess, lads. The boats are alongside. Mr. Byam, look at this bit of meat, sir. It's alive.
And tell her when this voyage is over, somehow, I'm coming back. - I can't tell her that. - I mean it, Roger. But it's a dream, Fletcher. This island isn't real for you and me. It's the ship that's real.
The welfare of men on shipboard depends upon things that seem small. A joke at the right moment. A glass of grog. A kind word would do more with seamen than the cat-o'-nine-tails. And this ship will be the worse if possible, for his death. Wonder if that's Defoe Island.
Good morning, Mr. Fryer. Oh, good morning, lad. Mr. Fryer, you say I was armed with a bayonet. - Did you see me use it? - By no means, lad. Address your replies to the court. Milord, he didn't use the bayonet.
I should be charmed. - And you, Mr. Driftwood? - I'll join up with you later. Listen, Gottlieb, nix on the lovemaking, because I saw Mrs. Claypool first. Of course, her mother really saw her first, but why bring the Civil War into this? What are you doing in my costume?
- Don't you know what duplicates are? - Sure, those five kids up in Canada. I wouldn't know about that. I haven't been in Canada in years. Go ahead and read it. - What does it say?
- Sure, those five kids up in Canada. I wouldn't know about that. I haven't been in Canada in years. Go ahead and read it. - What does it say? - Go on and read it.
I wouldn't know about that. I haven't been in Canada in years. Go ahead and read it. - What does it say? - Go on and read it. - You read it.
- I don't know. Let's hear it again. "The party of the first part shall be known in this contract... "as the party of the first part." Sounds a little better this time. It grows on you.
"You gave it to him and he gave it to me and I"... Get out! Get out! -Good morning. I wonder if you'II do me a favor. I have a joint account with my husband and I'd Iike to fix it that nobody can draw the money out but me.
Scenes that are brightest May charm awhile Hearts which are brightest And eyes that smile Lisa! Get off my train!
But if I saw what I thought I saw... I've had my last bottle. And it had better be the same with you. Now, I'm speaking to you as a sister to a sister. That's right. Now, that's... Let's get inside.
- Pardon, sir? Lock me in. Don't open that door before sunrise. Even if I call, pay no attention to it. Keep that door locked till dawn. Good night.
Even if I call, pay no attention to it. Keep that door locked till dawn. Good night. There it is, Paul. You can just see it through the trees. Dear old Falden.
I'll give you a 10-yard start. Off you go. Six, seven, eight, nine, ten. I've won! So you've seen this monster before? Yes.
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten. I've won! So you've seen this monster before? Yes. There was something grotesquely familiar about it. Then it suddenly struck me.
- Your wife? - I didn't know you were married. - Yes, I'm married. Nick, what'll I do? I know I had it. Don't worry, darling.
Welcome home. We are tendering this little surprise party for the... Will you keep out of the kitchen? We are busy. Where'll I put this ice? - Lay it down and don't bother me.
- Give me that phone. Give it to me. Yes. All right. We'll come. Nickie, I'm sorry.
I'm through with Robert, I mean it. I'm going to get my things. We're going to celebrate! We'll start the New Year right. - What is it, Henry? The telephone?
- Shut up, you lug. It's his wife. See? - Have you made up your mind? - All right, I'll give you the money. Tonight?
Now, wait a minute. Just a minute. That's a lot of money. How do I know you'll keep your promise? How do I know you'll really stay away? And, even if... Selma does decide to get a divorce, how do I know you won't fight it?
What do you think you're doing? Lights went out. You want me to stand out there while Nick might be in trouble? - What was the shooting? - I guess it was me. Did you get him?
No pepper. - It's there next to the salt. - Thanks. Then, what? - Yes, I mean it. - Of course you're right.
- It's there next to the salt. - Thanks. Then, what? - Yes, I mean it. - Of course you're right. She didn't do it.
Isn't that just dandy? - If we found out who took this place... - I took this. - You took what? - I took this picture. I found it in Pedro's apartment.
Dancer... there you are. You know, that check of Robert's for $20,000 was a forgery. - So, what's it to me? - It was traced from another check. I still say, so what's it to me? Just a minute, Lieutenant.
Tell him it isn't true. Ask him why he threw your gun away, Selma. He knew that it hadn't been fired. You'd only have to show it to prove your innocence. Yet he threw it away. Ask him why.
Put your hands in there. Then we'll button this up to protect your little neck. So you won't get cold. Do you know that you've got a nice voice? I had a much nicer voice till I ran a nail through it... You ran a nail through it! Let me hear you sing that again.
I won't agree to your terms under any conditions whatever. Take my offer to your commandant. The decision is his. If my terms are acceptable, instruct your colonel to raise the white flag. You should know the British never surrender. Yet their guns will be useless to them, if I may advise Your Highness. I suspected you had a plan. If Colonel Campbell accepts our terms and he would be exceedingly unwise not to it would be very simple.
2,200,000 francs. Four-and-a-half years of work, madame. Every pearl is matched and flawless. Believe me, madame, even at that price... I am not in the habit of bargaining when I see something I want. And I want this necklace.
This bill is made out to me. Naturally. Of course. 2,200,000 francs. Tell me, M. Duvalle, exactly how did you arrive at this figure? Dr. Pauquet, I can show you my books.
- Anything to declare? - Not a thing. Socks. 100 pesetas fine. There's something wrong with my car. I wonder if you can help me.
I am certainly not freezing, but I guess I better get my coat on. I'm getting gooseflesh. I wish you would hurry. I'll be through in a second. Don't you like it? Of course.
I'm getting gooseflesh. I wish you would hurry. I'll be through in a second. Don't you like it? Of course. But do you think it goes with those trousers?
Well, there was no need of it. I paid you a few compliments. I told you how charming and how lovely you were and I'd still repeat it, but I didn't do anything. But you intended to. I did not. You had it in your eye.
One, two, three, presto. It's gone. Where is it? In my stomach? That's what you think. It isn't. It's in the inside pocket of your coat and it isn't chicken anymore.
That's what you think. It isn't. It's in the inside pocket of your coat and it isn't chicken anymore. It's changed into a string of pearls. You know, that's marvellous. I can scarcely believe it. But you're right. It is in my inside pocket.
I've heard so much about you, it's just like meeting an old friend. We came to see you about the pearl necklace. Pearl necklace? Do you intend to buy another one? On the contrary. You see, the necklace that you sold mademoiselle is really very beautiful but too expensive for us, and I'm afraid we'll have to return it.
Pearl necklace? Do you intend to buy another one? On the contrary. You see, the necklace that you sold mademoiselle is really very beautiful but too expensive for us, and I'm afraid we'll have to return it. - You have it with you, dear? - Yes, darling.
Do you intend to buy another one? On the contrary. You see, the necklace that you sold mademoiselle is really very beautiful but too expensive for us, and I'm afraid we'll have to return it. - You have it with you, dear? - Yes, darling. Would it upset you too much if I would ask you to take it back?
Stop! Sandor, look at me. What do you see in my eyes? Death. Hurry. Hurry, it's almost daylight.
"Finest thing we've heard of in years." "Congratulations." I wonder what sort of telegrams we'll get when it's known that Wilson was an innocent man. Well, when I gave out the statement I didn't know that. This story is on every wire in the world right now. Yeah, yeah. Now he's innocent. Yeah.
According to the law which says if you kill somebody you gotta be killed yourself. I'll give them the chance they didn't give me. They'll get a legal trial in a legal courtroom. They'll have a legal judge and a legal defense. They'll get a legal sentence and a legal death. But I can't do it myself. You'll have to do it for me. You see that? I tore it out of a law book.

But I can't do it myself. You'll have to do it for me. You see that? I tore it out of a law book. My husband says it would be a blessing if the community would forget what happened.
In the ashes, I found this enclosed ring. Nobody knew it, so I was keeping it for a mement... Memento. But it is upsetting my conscience. I don't dare sign this, or I would probably get lynched myself. A citizen of Strand." I now draw your attention to this ring.
Are you very sad about it? That I have to leave so soon? Yes. Come. Hello, Ferryman! Hello! The shortest road to the village is over the moor.
Who's that? A guy that will beat anybody in the world... from Gandhi to Garbo. Bill Chandler. Bill Chandler? Yes. Now, you fired him, the best man we ever had on libel. - You admit it, and you fired him.
Goodbye, and good luck. Goodbye. Good luck to you. - Take his arm. - I'm taking your arm. Yes.
Thanks, sweetness. Would you open it for me, honeykins? Bill. - What is it? - Read it. - What does it say?
- the elbow low and close. - Low and close. Bull's eye! Give the gentleman a cigar. I don't quite seem to get it. It's your wrist, sir.
- No, just clean. Stop turning my head. Now, for the purpose of the record, what time will you arrive at the bazaar? Once and for all, I am not attending the bazaar. Bill, what is it? What is it?
I'm afraid it's true, Connie. They've even met the woman. No. I don't believe it. I won't. Now, Connie, please.
You're getting all excited. Now come along... What about this? - It's nothing, Bill. - Yes, what about this? I can explain that thing.
- What happened? The smartest thing I did was to make that trip. - Did you get? - No, but I will get the power of attorney. I asked him what he was going to do with the money. Know what he said?
But, if you don't mind, I'm rather interested in the treasurer's report. The treasurer reports a deficit of $180,000 for the current year. A deficit? We lost that much? You see, Mr Deeds, the opera is not conducted for profit. - It isn't? What is it conducted for?
Well, there you are. Grant's tomb. I hope you're not disappointed. - It's wonderful. - To most people it's an awful let-down. Huh?
- I'm from a small town too, you know. - Really? - Probably as small as Mandrake Falls. - What do you know about that! It's a beautiful little town, too. Grove poplar trees right along main street.
Thank you. You know what I've been doin' since I got home? I've been workin' on a poem. It's about you. Sometimes it's kind of hard for me to say things, so I write 'em. I'd like to read it sometime.
- Yes, sir. A smaller bowl. - Did you get that stuff? - Stuff, sir? - That goo that tastes like soap. Yes, sir.
Semi-comma. Now everything is on the up and up. - lsn't that swell? - One thing I want you to promise. - What? - Don't come and ask any of it back. You listen to this - when we make an agreement, it is an agreement.
Come on in. Don't be afraid. - I got something for ya. Look. I got some presents for ya. See? See the pretty feather? Sure. Sure.
Hickok, my friend, speak with straight tongue. Hickok, white man friend, speak with forked tongue. Now, you tell, which way soldier take bullet? Bill, what's in that watch? Bill! Bill, you got my picture. You kept it.
Are you accusing me of eating your sandwich? You might begin by taking that piece of lettuce off your necktie. One, two, three. Let's try it again from the beginning. - I'm getting it, aren't I? - Yes.
She's the most wonderful little teacher I've ever heard of. Miss Carrol, I want to show Mr. Gordon how much you just taught me. No, never mind. Thank you. That's very sweet of you. I'm anxious for Mr. Gordon to see this. It's an interesting experiment. How did you say that last step went?
Yes, they might. It's funny how we met, and all that's happened to us since. The way we've been sort of thrown together and everything. As if it were all meant to happen. It's quite an experience. It's more than an experience.
- Come again, miss? - Bugs. The second half he left to Jane, providing she was alive and could be induced to return to civilization. Otherwise, the bugs get the whole million. And if you succeed in bringing this good news to your cousin you hope to profit to some extent. Well, I've staked every penny I've got on it.
Been ordering suits and overcoats from London? It feels like a brief. Darling, I hope they don't ask you to .. That's too bad. ─ What? My assistant, Bailey, had his appendix out last night.
Hmm. You see that neck? See the blood oozing through the cut in the glove worn by the murderer Left a distinct mark on the woman's throat. That thin line of blood indicating an almost vertical cut. It matches completely the cut on your hand, Lewis. Why, the wound on Dearden's hand is an inch shorter and horizontal. That evidence is going to hang you, Lewis. Unless it was self-defence.
It's my birthday. Aren't you afraid you're not strong enough yet? Oh, I'm afraid of nothing except being bored. - It's supper after the theater. - Thank you, I'll come with pleasure. And bring this book as a present.
Your income won't let you go very far in any great style. - I could use some of the principal. - You will do nothing of the sort. Your grandfather's legacy mustn't be touched. However, I have a few thousand francs I can spare. - You mean, you'll give me the money?
I'll explain to Jacques myself. - She has some good reason, monsieur. - Yes, I'm sure of that. Oh, there you are. Isn't it the most beautiful day? Is it so beautiful?
- Place your bets, gentlemen. Armand wins again. He drew nine three times. Well done, well done. Let it stand. - You'll lose it all.
- Baron de Varville is not a patient man and you're in the mood to quarrel tonight. You don't want to lose your rich admirer. I understand. Your own fortunes would fall with him. Armand, he's not to blame for what happened. That I swear. Then how could you do what you did? I'll tell you. Because your heart is a thing that can be bought and sold.
Come in here, all of you! You see this woman? You know her? Then listen to what I'm going to say. I accepted her favors because I thought she loved me. I let her make sacrifices when there were others who had more to give. But bear witness, I owe her nothing.
You see this woman? You know her? Then listen to what I'm going to say. I accepted her favors because I thought she loved me. I let her make sacrifices when there were others who had more to give. But bear witness, I owe her nothing. Take it.
Goodbye, Your Highness. Mr Halton. Why do you want to know her name? Because I'm dining with her at a quarter to nine. You are a friend of Captain Buckler's. What a lovely song.
Why do you want to know her name? Because I'm dining with her at a quarter to nine. You are a friend of Captain Buckler's. What a lovely song. What's the name of it? It has no name.
- Tell me, who knocked at the door? - Oh, Graham. - At this time of the night? Why? - A telegram. - Was it so important? - I didn't open it, it was for you.
We're a hopelessly happy married couple. Hm. - What's that? - Oh... Just... just something I made up. That's nice.
- Almost too lovely. - Oh, you must finish it. It's not so easy. Well, I don't know. The beginning is so beautiful, I wonder if the end matters. It's an old tune, but it's still good.
What was the name of that little hotel? Hm. I don't remember the name or how we got there. - All I remember is... - It was glorious, wasn't it? - And what a hotel.
- All I remember is... - It was glorious, wasn't it? - And what a hotel. - Let's forget it. Oh! Oh, no.
Graham, would you be good enough to hand me my nailfile? - You're going to the opera, sir? - Yes, that's where I'm going. If I may say so, sir, my favourite opera is Cavelleria Rusticana. It's only one act, but it has everything. Love, jealousy, hate, murder, and all in 35 minutes.
I'm proud to be in your house. Thanks. You know, I've been thinking about you a great deal. Now, I hope that little story of mine hasn't worried you. It's an unusual story. I shouldn't mind reading it in a novel.
It's always ridiculous to reason with a man in love. And I'm afraid you are a man in love. I don't know. It may be more than love, or less than love. Well, man, make up your mind. What is it?
And I'm afraid you are a man in love. I don't know. It may be more than love, or less than love. Well, man, make up your mind. What is it? It's...
And you're the wife of a charming and famous man. - You must be very happy, Lady Barker. - I am. Don't be afraid. I won't play it. I shall never play it.
- These papers came from Mr Hamilton, sir. - Oh, good. By the way, I'm going to Geneva. - Didn't you tell me Mr Hamilton is going? - I've changed my mind. Oh, I thought it was only a sub-committee meeting.
- Would you like to know what he said? - Very much. He said she had blonde hair, blue eyes, my figure and a slight foreign accent. Sounds like a description of you. It does, doesn't it? It annoyed me that there should be another woman who looks exactly like me.
My goodness, I just thought.... Yes, you just thought that if I'd stay up there... you'd show me exactly how innocent a night in the country can be, didn't you? Are you still harping on that same old string? It doesn't matter to me whether you go or stay. I was just trying to make it easier for you, that's all. Did you have to throw that gadget away?
My daughter keeps telling me about him. It seems, my dear friend, we shall soon become related, don't you think? I would be most honoured, Your Excellency. And I would be most happy, dear baron. Because I would not be who I am today were it not for you. - I will never forget that.
I would be most honoured, Your Excellency. And I would be most happy, dear baron. Because I would not be who I am today were it not for you. - I will never forget that. - I did it for my country. Besides...
My mother has it, but it's sissy for a fellow to have it, unless he's sick. Who are you calling a sissy? I'll take care of it. Did you say I was a sissy? I said some people might think eating off of trays was sissy. Well, let's get something to eat anyway, huh, Harvey?
I'll take care of it. Did you say I was a sissy? I said some people might think eating off of trays was sissy. Well, let's get something to eat anyway, huh, Harvey? You heard me order it. Go ahead, Charles.
Sit up! Move. This isn't the way my Treasure Island looks. It's the very first way anybody ever saw Treasure Island. Gee, it's very valuable, huh? Sure.
Why? He says if we don't let him and Pogey Williams and Alvin Savage... join the Buffaloes... - I'll have to leave school. - What? I don't know what to do with this. He gave it to me.
- Yes. I was going to tell you it was from me. I thought maybe you'd make the history exam easier. You went to the dentist and came back late, and I didn't get a chance to tell you. - I had no idea it was from you. - You kept it, though.
We'll have to find out tomorrow. I know what he said, sir. Persons in Coventry do not speak after a class is dismissed. Kind of funny about Eddie stopping where he did. Yes. Yes, it was.
That's what we're hoping to do catching fish. But he's rich. He can buy more fish than you ever saw. Why, he owns the boat I fell off. - You mean the liner? - Yes, he practically owns it.
That's the Duncan Street, and anything else you want to know? Where you learn all this? I read a book on it in Capt. Disko's cabin, and I don't care who knows it. And you can go row your old boat all by yourself. I wouldn't go out in it for anything. By golly, that's smart kid.
What are you talking about? You're not going. We'll save you. We have good times together, eh, little fish? We laugh, we sing, so you smile now. Come on, smile.
- You sure you haven't made a mistake? - You have nothing to worry about. The last patient I gave one of those to won the Kentucky Derby. May I examine this, please? Do you actually give those to your patients? Isn't that awfully large for a pill?
- Come on, come on. - All right. Don't hurry. I've got it someplace. I know it's someplace. Here.
No, don't look at me. Let me look at you, huh? No. Don't look at me. What do you think I am, a peepshow? Get away there, will you? It's rather a strange-looking sight.
He's got apple dumpling? Dr. Hackenbush he's got apple dumpling. No apple dumpling. No, it's no apple dumpling. No. No.
If Hi Hat wins, we can kiss the sanitarium goodbye. Well, Morgan, you got nothing to worry about. Hi Hat's not on this track. See he doesn't get on. Put a man at every gate. If that nag slips by you, it means your job. Here. Keep me posted.
What for? To escape. What do you dig with? With a coal shovel, old cans... We should come up in a garden... behind those buildings... It's open country. Slow work.
I don't know who will win this war... The end, whatever it may be, will mean the end of the Rauffensteins and the Boeldieux. We may be superfluous. And don't you find it a pity? Perhaps... I admire your care of your geranium. Not because I have turned botanist.
Today, haircut and another big party. Well, it's the same party. What? A party three days and three nights? That's splendido, splendido, magnifico! It isn't a party.
[WHISTLE BLOWS] [BELL RINGS] Ward. Nick, stop them. It's awful. Please stop them.
Yeah, loosen up, give out, will you, Nick? - All right, all right. - Come on. So you don't get indigestion. Turkey Morgan's been shooting his mouth off to get Kid Galahad into an early match. You birds said it would draw a million-dollar gate.
What are you trying to do, Nick? Pull another fast one? If I wanted to take the title away from you, I wouldn't spend 50 grand to do it. I'm dumping my fighter. The more McGraw cracks him up, the better I'll like it. The old wheeze that he double-crossed you, eh?
Now, don't you worry. At a longest, it'll be over in an hour. I know, but I'm afraid Nick will get back at him. Not while there's a chance of getting that title from McGraw and Morgan. - You don't think so? - No, I'm sure of it.
Postpone the Far East conference. We can't meet those nations without Conway. This can't be kidnapping. They wouldn't be taking us so far on such a dangerous trip. No sense to it. What do you make of it, Bob? You must have some idea.
What brought them there, unless it was to meet us? Chang's first question was about the pilot. There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. What reason could they have for doing a thing like that? That's what's on the other side of the hill.
They were. - That must have taken... - Centuries. Centuries. Where did you get the money to pay for all these treasures? We have no money as you know it.
- That was easy. I'd read your books. - You've read my books? You do more things. What have my books got to do with it? I saw a man whose life was empty. "A man whose life was empty. "
A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably. With the same amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why? Maybe 'cause you've always been part of Shangri-La without knowing it. - I wonder.
What else can I think after a tale like that? Things like that don't happen today. - We're living in the 20th century. - You think it's nonsense? You've been hypnotised by fanatics. I wouldn't believe it in England.
And that, gentlemen was the last that any known human being saw of Robert Conway. That's what I call fortitude. - Think of it. - Tell me something, Gainsford. What do you think of his talk about Shangri-La? Do you believe it? Yes. I believe it.
So these two gentlemen said they were lords? And you believed them? -Yes! How long have you known these two lords? -Not long at all. We met them here on the train. And who did you tell them you were? Spit it out!
Locked! It's locked. -Yes. Here. Thank you. is it him? -Obviously it is... not!
You stay here. I would have rather told you something nicer, you can believe me. But you would have found out about it at some point, and then it wouldn't have been so easy to give it all up. Give it all up? -Of course! Or don't you understand it yet? -No, I understand everything perfectly.
Defendant, stay with the facts! -Excuse me, court ofjustice. The facts! We are accused of having pretended to be Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. We didn't do that a single time! Quite the contrary, we contradicted it, right Macky? We denied and repudiated.
Here it comes! - It's after us. - Don't let it out. Hold it shut. - Now's our chance. Get it now! - Quick! - Give it to it! Don't let it get away! Hold on there.
- It's after us. - Don't let it out. Hold it shut. - Now's our chance. Get it now! - Quick! - Give it to it! Don't let it get away! Hold on there. It's only Dopey.
- Now's our chance. Get it now! - Quick! - Give it to it! Don't let it get away! Hold on there. It's only Dopey. - Did you see it?
- Quick! - Give it to it! Don't let it get away! Hold on there. It's only Dopey. - Did you see it? - How big is it?
- Give it to it! Don't let it get away! Hold on there. It's only Dopey. - Did you see it? - How big is it? - Was it a dragon?
Hold on there. It's only Dopey. - Did you see it? - How big is it? - Was it a dragon? - Has it got horns?
- Has it got horns? - Was it breathing fire? - Was it droolin'? What was it doin'? He says it's a, a monster asleep in our beds! - Let's attack.
- Was it breathing fire? - Was it droolin'? What was it doin'? He says it's a, a monster asleep in our beds! - Let's attack. - While it's sleeping.
- Let's attack. - While it's sleeping. Yeah, while it's sleeping. - Hurry, men. It's now or never! - Off with its head. - Break its bones. - Chop it to pieces.
It's now or never! - Off with its head. - Break its bones. - Chop it to pieces. We'll kill it dead. - Jiminy Crickets! - Gosh! - Gee! - What a monster!
- Off with its head. - Break its bones. - Chop it to pieces. We'll kill it dead. - Jiminy Crickets! - Gosh! - Gee! - What a monster! It covers three beds.
She's gone. Casey, you're a fool. I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Topper, to have caused you this embarrassment. I... I hope you'll accept my apology. Oh, but think nothing of it. Promise me you'll think nothing of it.
It's only natural you'd think that, feeling the way you do about her. Father, what is it she feels for him? Is it love? Pity? I've a faint suspicion it's more than pity. What a nest for a honeymoon.
Please, tell me what's the matter. Oh, kid. The bottom has dropped out of everything. Darling, what's happened? Read this. What's this got to do with you?
Nobody's going to make a sucker out of me. Hello? Give me the hospital, quick. Alright, bring him to the hospital, immediately. Prepare for a transfusion. Will it be necessary to postpone the execution?
But since Prince John has seized the regency Guy of Gisbourne and his traitors have murdered and pillaged. You've all suffered from their cruelty. The ear loppings, the beatings the blindings with hot irons, the burning of our homes the mistreatment of our women. It's time we put an end to this! - Robin's right. - Aye! Now, this forest is wide.
Well, since our friend seems to have gone a little mad, I'll have to see him through. We'll have to see him through. Prepare final flight. Does my lady find it interesting? Lady Marian? - Oh, I'm sorry.
- Tell me where. - Do you want to send a message? - To his men, yes. Well, my lady, I have had a nip of ale of a night, just now and again at a place in the town and I won't deny as some of the others were there. Where was it? Oh, Bess, please tell me!
He's not brutal like... Tell me, when you are in love, is it well, is it hard to think of anybody but one person? Yes, indeed, and sometimes there's a bit of trouble sleeping. I know, but it's a nice kind of not sleeping. Yes, and it affects your appetite too. Not that I've noticed it's done that to you, except when he was waiting to be hanged.
- Thank you. The next time we're escorted by an officer we'll probably both be wearing handcuffs. RANDOLPH: A blood pressure on yourself? - Yes. Unfortunate that interruption in Mrs. Updyke's boudoir would have been a perfect moment for a blood pressure during the robbery.
- You ran out and left him in a tough spot. - Sure. Why not? He can stand another pinch but not me. I'm too hot. - Never mind the alibis. Where's the stuff? - We never laid eyes on it, Jo. The papers carry a big story of what's missing.
Huh? - Right down there, professor. - Well, so far so good. This loft has been cleaned out perfectly. How about it, Rocks? You got it?
Medical notes. What for? For an exhaustive scientific work on criminology. - All about them jobs we pulled? - Yes. They're covered extensively. - Suppose the cops get hold of this book? - It's very unlikely.
What's good for it? It all depends what kind of headache it is, the cause. How's paradol? Paradol chloride isn't effective for headaches, if that's what you mean. What's it used for? Well, chiefly insomnia, in minute doses.
Well, chiefly insomnia, in minute doses. It's a sedative. And a poison. - Got any? - Why, certainly. Every doctor has. May I see it?
- He would be intent solely upon his idea. So obsessed, that he could commit murder. Yes, but his hand was forced. Clitterhouse, are you stating a hypothetical case or has all this actually happened? - Assume that it has happened. - Well?
-What? The hundred grand? I had it for you, only as I said, I didn't expect-- -I know. You said it before. -You don't have to worry about it. -I'm not worried.
-Your cut? -Yeah. That was the idea, wasn't it? I took the rap, three years. You took the dough, made connections built it up. For you and me.
He was a swell kid when we first got married. But he tried to give me a lot more than he could get driving a cab. Partly my fault. I didn't stop him. Well, he got in deeper and deeper. One night, he tried to shoot it out with the cops.
11:00. That'll give you time to get to the bank. Take $ 100,000 out of my personal account and give it to him. What's up? Is he holding you? -Tell him yes. -Yes.
What's the idea of bringing the cops in? Because I'm not a mug. I'm smart, see. Sure, you'd like rough stuff. Why, when you can do it nice and legal? No trouble, no fuss.
-About 100. A hundred? How come? It's twice as much as I got. -You wanna make something out of it? -No. No.
-You wanna make something out of it? -No. No. He deserves it. Why you starting trouble? You pull in your ears. What are we gonna do with it?
You flash this wad on me, then try to tell me the dough is mine. -What's it all about? -You've got a great poker face, Rocky. But don't forget, I've known that face for a long time. I know you forced Frazier to get you $ 100,000. Everybody knows it. What's the difference where the dough came from?
-What's it all about? -You've got a great poker face, Rocky. But don't forget, I've known that face for a long time. I know you forced Frazier to get you $ 100,000. Everybody knows it. What's the difference where the dough came from? First place, Frazier owed it to me. It's mine.
What's that? Rice. Rice? Sure. Don't you use it over here? Why, of course we do, for puddings. Oh, we use it for weddings.
Yes, sir? Will you step in, please? Yes, Father? Nicole. What happened? You bought it?
Yeah, home. Where's your mother, Skinny? Come on. We'll see what we can do. Mr. Morris, do you know who broke your window? - Yes, Your Honor. - Pardon me, but does it really matter? It was a free-for-all.
- That has nothing to do with it. - Stop talking and take out the pin. Oh, my, this is so silly. Of course. Do you think it would roll if it were square? I have reference to a mark on the ball. That proves it's a CrowFlight. That's mine.
Now everything is quite all right No, everything is not all Everything is not all right, Susan. Maybe for you, but I've got to get to New York. Now one thing's settled, you start worrying about something else. One of us should worry! On top of all this, we've stolen a car!
No, everything is not all Everything is not all right, Susan. Maybe for you, but I've got to get to New York. Now one thing's settled, you start worrying about something else. One of us should worry! On top of all this, we've stolen a car! That's all right. I'll send it back. I don't like it, anyway.
Of course, it varies at different seasons. - Let me see now, what month is this? - June. June? It would go something like this. I'll just prepare for it. Now, let me see.
I've never known anything like it. Ever since I came into the house there's been something wrong. - Elizabeth... - It's been bedlam! - Don't you think it's time we went inside? - No. We've only just left it. But don't you think it's a good idea to go back? No, I think it's a good idea to continue our walk.
- You may go. All right, sir. And yet, I am terribly anxious. I asked you to leave. Yes, sir. Terribly anxious because I am sure Sorgues was hypnotized. Someone here has the evil eye.
It's not that we won't, but that we can't. We know nothing. Fine. I was counting on your honesty, your loyalty... I see I was mistaken. I swear, Sorgues said nothing.
That hair. Julia, seriously, what is all this? I told you, where I live. I wrote it down on the back of an envelope for you. But it's enormous. I'm overcome.
The Seton Concerto in F Major. Come on, Neddie. Neddie, play it. Play it, Neddie. Johnny and I can bear it. Can't we?
Father wanted a big family, you know. Mother had Linda straight off to oblige him. Linda was a girl, so she promptly had Julia. Julia was a girl and it seemed hopeless. The next year Mother had me and there was much joy in the land. It was a boy and the fair name of Seton would flourish.
- My, it's good to be home again. - Yes, we've had quite a long walk. - This is a shame, it really is. I was going to give a party tonight. I had it all planned. I was going to....
- Yes, we've had quite a long walk. - This is a shame, it really is. I was going to give a party tonight. I had it all planned. I was going to.... Well, it was a good idea.
We've come to warn his future bride. He never puts the cap back on the toothpaste. Then we'll drink a toast to Johnny. He needs it. Needs it? No, I'm wrong.
- Well, more than I need to live by. It's been my idea to make a few thousands early in the game and then quit for as long as it lasts and try to find out who I am and what goes on now, while I'm young and feel good all the time. I'm sure Julia understands what I'm getting at, don't you, Julia? I'm not sure I do, Johnny. You wish to occupy yourself otherwise, is that it? Please don't make me feel guilty about it.

I'm sure Julia understands what I'm getting at, don't you, Julia? I'm not sure I do, Johnny. You wish to occupy yourself otherwise, is that it? Please don't make me feel guilty about it. Even if it is a fool idea that people dream about and then go flat on.
And, Henry, tell Miss Julia. He'll be up in a minute. Are you sure you want to get over him? No, I'm not and that's what scares me most. I feel alive and I love it. I feel at last something's happening to me.
Linda you agree there's only one thing for me to do now, don't you? Compromise? Yes. Yes. You think that's right, don't you? - I don't think it matters a bit what I think.
Coming between two young people in love is furthest from my wish or intention. For love, true love, is a very rare and beautiful thing. Where are you going? Please, sit down. And I believe that its path that is to say the course of true love, contrary to the adage, should run smooth. I am a man of 58 years and speak from a long experience and observation.
I am a man of 58 years and speak from a long experience and observation. It is of paramount importance-- - I beg your pardon, sir? - Yes? If that position at the bank is still open I'll be glad to take it. I'm still not convinced.
I'm so sorry to have troubled you. To Madame Poulard's. - Julie, it's perfectly lovely. - I don't like the color. And does it have to be so tight here? - It binds. And the skirt...
Ever hear of a man and his liquor getting yellow fever? I aim to carry all I can hold, and I advise you gentlemen to do likewise. Huger aims not to be carried off by anything but drink. It's no joking matter. Looks mighty serious. More cases than you hear about.
It was dreadful. I guess it's pretty serious. Pres Dillard's coming home on account of it. Pres is coming home. Of course. Did you know it?
Armed guards are patrolling the road as far up as Riverview. Stopping everybody coming from the city. It's mighty bad in the city, mighty bad. - We're all very fortunate to be up here. - Are any gentlefolk taken down? Major Crandall's dead with it, for one.
It's mighty bad in the city, mighty bad. - We're all very fortunate to be up here. - Are any gentlefolk taken down? Major Crandall's dead with it, for one. Ned Warrington's got it. No telling how many others.
Of course, it's a pity Pres had to leave now. But I suppose his bank comes first. You don't find that admirable? Oh, admirable, I suppose. It just seems to me there are other things more interesting. I imagine Buck finds it so.
Well, when the white gentlemen stop me I leave the horse and go walking across the back of the parish because I'm bound to get back to Halcyon. I just kind of squinched through the cane by the bayou. - You swam the bayou? - No, ma'am, Miss Julie. I scared of them gators. I just kind of found me a double-end boat. It ain't like I stealing, Miss Julie.
-A little woman in tweeds. -Yes. -With a three quarter coat. -With a scarf. That's right. I saw her when you passed the compartment. I knew I was right. But your husband said he didn't see her. He didn't notice, but as soon as he mentioned it, I remembered at once. You win. This calls for action.
-You need peace and rest. -Sorry, nothing doing. -lsn't there anything we can do? -Yes, find Miss Froy. If she does not rest I will not answer for her. It will be best if you persuade her. She likes you. I'm as popular as a dose of strychnine.
Go ahead, she's done it. It's all right, it's just my legs. Or as they say in English, jolly good luck to them. I'm glad that's over. Heaven knows what the government will say about it. -Nothing at all.
I'm not a doctor. I sell cut-price trinkets. Nobody asked you what you did. There's some rainwater outside in the bucket. As you wish. Are you an artist? I wish I was. I love the arts.
- You were wrong to. He worked hard to feed me and gave me spending money. And I spoke to him insolently with my lofty pretentiousness and stupidity. I was ashamed of the grocery. The grocery should've been ashamed of me. Come on, it's not such a drama.
So I say no. Listen. Here's what I need for tomorrow. Three monkeys. Peculiar music-box. Sealskin kayak. Orange-blossom crown. Worm in a jar. Veterinary syringe. I'm thinking of it now. I'll dream of it. By noon tomorrow, I'll have found, rented or bought it all.
Even if he debases himself before them? If he agrees to debase himself, he is even greater for it. Because he sacrifices pride to lighten our loads. We should call them Saint Molière and Saint Charlie! But laughter itself. It's an absurd, vulgar convulsion. Don't speak ill of laughter.
What do you say, Donald boy? Well, I delivered all the candy. Where's my beautiful wife? Oh, lordy! Here's a new one, Ed. Taste it.
They're coming over to see you now, I guess. Did you hear about it, Grandpa? We maybe all have to move. Who said so? Everyone's talking about it. Somebody's buying up everything here.
Yes, but I never knew what it was. It's hers. It's never left here. She hasn't either. I can still hear the tinkle of her thin little voice and see her eyes laughing. That's the reason I've lived in this house so many years and could never move out.
My dad, he makes fireworks because he never grew up, I guess. And, Mother. Do you know why Mother writes plays? She likes literature and good books. No, because eight years ago, a typewriter was delivered to the house by mistake. If it had been a plough, she'd have taken up farming, huh?
What do you say, mister? Want to learn to do the Big Apple? - That's against the law, you know? - So is necking. - How much is it? - Ten cents.
Not with your mother here. - It's going up. It's all over my body now. - Please don't. It's in my throat. It's fighting to get out.
- It's going up. It's all over my body now. - Please don't. It's in my throat. It's fighting to get out. I can't hold it back any longer.
Make it frankfurters, and tell Donald to get... Tell Donald to get a dozen more and an extra can of corn. - See if Rheba has enough sauerkraut. - All right. - Tell Donald to hurry. - Yes.
I'll phone them all. So, you're the one that's been holding up my deal? - Yes. Kind of funny, isn't it? - What's funny about it? The idea of you engineering this thing and being caught in your own trap.
"It's peaceful here and I've thought it all out. "I know now the situation between Tony and me is impossible. "Mrs. Kirby was right. I should have stayed in my own backyard. "Don't worry about me, Mother. I'll get over it. "But, my darlings, I'm so lonesome for you.
Now, let's play a duet good and loud. You'll be surprised at what might happen. Let's see, what shall we play? Do you know Polly Wolly Doodle? - You ought to know it. - Polly Wolly Doodle? We drove you almost crazy with it once.
Let's see, what shall we play? Do you know Polly Wolly Doodle? - You ought to know it. - Polly Wolly Doodle? We drove you almost crazy with it once. You know it, of course you do.
That's what I like about Morris's. It's salesmen are so specialized. Are you the man who sold me this thing? Yes, mam. You told me it opened cans. Lady, that ain't the half of it. This little thing is one of the wonders of the ages. It's a screwdriver, a bottle opener, a cheese slicer, ice pick and vegetable parer.
That's it, it's something personal. Mr. Morris, look. I wanna thank you, see. When anyone asks me now where I worked last, I don't turn around and walk out. You're supposed to be a very dangerous character. They told me that a man with your record would never go straight. I'm glad that you proved them wrong. Keep it up, kid.
Oh, I'm sorry, I... I was just thinking I didn't know anything about you before and... And what, Joe? Well, I get crazy when I think there was another guy, maybe, or... or something, or... Well... Let's skip it, huh?
Yeah, remember? The first time we seen him was in the mess hall. We didn't know who he was. But we got it over the grapevine. A bigshot was coming up. And the screws wouldn't answer no questions. And then, after lights out... Yeah...
Parole? Didn't she tell you? I know a babe that roomed in the same cell with her. You mean you didn't know it? She's been making a sap out of you all this time? I didn't say nothing, Joe.
Yes, yes. That's because it's written with the left hand. "Star of Delhi will never reach the Tower of London." Curious, and anonymous. And what is the Star of Delhi? Probably the largest emerald in the world, a gift to her majesty from the Maharajah of Rapur. Oh, I shouldn't worry about this, Sir Ronald.
The sap's not dry yet. That means it was torn off within the last few hours. Ah. What have you found, Holmes? It's a watch fob. Looks like a rabbit's foot. No, no, no.
- Tell him what? - About life. Life. - Who's life? - Now, Nickie, this is important. This is your responsibility.
It was just a thought. Well, here's the knife. - That's the one that was used, all right. - Could be the one that was tossed at me. Not much chance of fingerprints... after the dog's been playing with it for nobody knows how long. I'm apologizing.
Take it easy, Lois. Maybe Father was right about Dudley, and I wouldn't listen to him. Oh, poor Father. All right. - Well, I guess that does it. - Does what?
Can I do something? I just wanted someone to keep an eye on Nickie. - Let me. - That's very nice, but I... - Lois should get some sleep anyway. - Well, thank you very much.
- There were some books. - I'll get those, Nickie. - Thank you, Mommy. A glass of water. - I'll get it. No, Mrs. Bellam, you stay here.
Wait a moment. Guild says this woman was the one at Chestevere Apartments. I'm afraid for once the Lieutenant is wrong. She wasn't. Look, Nickie, it's smoking. It worked. Give me that rod.
You knew that he had you in a spot where he could blackmail you for life. So you shot him as he stood on that ledge and threw the gun out your window. You're right about Linda Mills and all the other things. I got sick of playing Little Red Riding Hood to that old guy. When Phil was trying to get money out of him... I found we spoke the same language. I'm not sorry for it.
I come in. You follow me. I don't know you're there. Now, I take out my money. I count it. What happens? Punchy, what's the matter for you?
Go on. You no find it? It's not in here either. Santa Claus, it looks like a white Christmas. If he wakes up, I pity us. Here, hold that.
Whenever we play sheriffs and Injuns, I'm always your pa. Couldn't do better, son. Gosh, I bet you've killed a lot of men in the course of duty. - Get goin', son. I'll be right with ya. - How 'bout me handling it?
- I just come over here to apologize. - Apologize for what? For not knowin' who's the real boss of Bottleneck. - My coffee, Clara. - Don't let me interfere with your dinner, ma'am. It's breakfast. Breakfast, huh?
Look at that. Chamois skins. Takes the shine off your nose, she says. Look! Isn't that lovely? You should've seen the parasol that came with it. - About the size of a pie. - Ohh! It must've been darling. Make the most of it today.
- Oh. Why didn't I stay in the gutter where I was well-off? That's right! Would I go under the ground? No, there's no future in it! - Miss Frenchy, honey, you know that blue dress? Well, you can't wear it no more. It's got beer on it.
- That's all for now, boys. - That's the idea of the song: Get me a free drink. - I sorta gathered that. - You liked it, huh? - Yeah, it was all right!
I don't answer questions. - [Chuckling] Let's have the money. - First sign the receipt. - What? - That is, if you don't mind. Please? - It's a mighty fine thing when a man realizes he's wrong... and tries to correct it in a nice way.
Oh, darling. I am so happy! You must be hungry. I'll get you something to eat. Well, how about a nice cold drink? That's great. It will just put me in the mood.
There's plenty. It's the very last of my father's fine Madeira. He got it from his uncle Admiral Will Hamilton of Savannah who married his cousin Jessica Carroll of Carrolton who was his second cousin and akin to the Wilkeses too. I saved it to wish Ashley a merry Christmas. But you mustn't drink it all at once, because it is the last. I meant it, my dear.
I won't think about that now. I'll think about that tomorrow. GERALD: Katie Scarlett! It's over! It's over!
I hate Scarlett! She's the only thing I hate worse than Tara! It's all my fault. I should've committed robbery to get that tax money for you. I couldn't let you do anything like that. Anyway, it's done now.
You're like the thief who isn't sorry he stole but he's terribly sorry he's going to jail. I'm glad Mother's dead. I'm glad she's dead so she can't see me. I always wanted to be like her, calm and kind and sadly, I've turned out disappointing. You know, Scarlett, I think you're on the verge of a crying jag. So I'll change the subject and say what I came to say. Say it, then, and get out!
You're impossible. You can go. I don't care if you never come back. But I will come back. What are you thinking about, Scarlett? I'm thinking about how rich we are. I can keep the lumber business too?
[CRYING] RHETT: Wake up. Wake up! You were having another nightmare. Rhett, I was so cold and hungry and so tired.
RHETT: Grip tightly with your legs. Lean forward and go with him. Hold your reins properly in a firm hand. Up! That was fine.
It's because I'm going to have a baby. Indeed. And who's the happy father? You know it's yours. I don't want it any more than you do. No woman would want the child of a cad like you.
She's delirious. Rhett.... I want Rhett! What's the matter, honey? Did you call somebody, child? It's no use.
Then when you were sick, and it was all my fault. I hoped that you'd call for me. But you didn't. I wanted you. I wanted you desperately but I didn't think you wanted me. It seems we've been at cross purposes, doesn't it?
- It's a bit battered, sir. - Do you lose your cap often? - That's a silly question. - Give that to me! It's awfully dusty, sir. I'll see to it for you, sir.
- That's right. Look, there it is. There. - Look, over there. - It's a cloud. - Searchlight's got it.
Yes? About fifty yards from where Sir Charles fell dead were footprints. A man's or woman's? Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound! A hound? Why didn't you report it? Not a soul would have believed it.
During the night it rained and in the morning the marks were completely obliterated. But I saw them. As clearly as I see you and then a few days ago as one of the executors of the estate I found this: This old document. Legend of the hound of the Baskervilles. Let me read it to you, Mr. Holmes.
I didn't want to startle you, I thought you might be asleep. What is it? Come quickly someone's prowling around. What are you doing, Barryman. Oh, nothing sir, it was the window. The window?
The window? Yes, sir I was just seeing that it was fastened. What does it matter whether it is fastened or not? A window on the second floor. I go around every night seeing that they are fastened. Sir Charles always insisted upon it. Well that sounds reasonable enough.
There it is again. and there it goes. Just as I thought. Barryman was signalling someone. Come on get some clothes we'll find out. It's still there. Yes
Vast, barren, mysterious Do you see those bright green spots over there? It seems a little more fertile than the rest. Fertile? That's the great Grimpen mire. One false step means death While only yesterday one of the moor ponies wondered into it.
Fertile? That's the great Grimpen mire. One false step means death While only yesterday one of the moor ponies wondered into it. Turn me sick with horror to see it struggling and the sound of its screams... What's that? Oh, that.
Tomorrow we will be away from this place. I wish it were now. So do I. Oh, now don't be silly Good night, Beryl. Good night, dear.
I am determined to live 100 years and more, if your new elixir does what you promise. What's the matter? Why are the bells ringing at this hour? And so strangely? What's the matter with the Hunchback? You see?
Sorry, but I've got to. There's a lot you have to know. I might as well start now. I didn't know there were women like that. I only told you all this so you'd understand what happened today. I'm glad it happened. Changes a lot of ideas I've had about you. I'm glad, too.
I do thank you, you know. It's all so sporting. The way it is in books. Or prizefights. I suppose I'm interrupting what is undoubtedly a most touching farewell. But Maida, darling, I do hope your going abroad at this time won't be a mistake. A mistake? To go away and leave such a fascinating husband around loose. I don't like to tell you this, dear, but... Then I'm sure I won't want to hear it, darling.
Darling, I told you. She's running into all sorts of legal red tape over there. They're tightening up on the requirements. All she can do is wait. That's all any of us can do. Wait, wait. We've been waiting, it's been four months and we're just where we were when we started. Look, dear, do you think I like it? Don't you think it means as much to me as it does to you?
They're tightening up on the requirements. All she can do is wait. That's all any of us can do. Wait, wait. We've been waiting, it's been four months and we're just where we were when we started. Look, dear, do you think I like it? Don't you think it means as much to me as it does to you? I don't know whether it does or not.
Can you make out the beacon light? - Not yet. About time we came up with it. - Look to starboard.
Well, I'll tell you if you don't know. It's me! I'm doin' it, see. And I'll ride up the capitol steps if I feel like it. So you talked it over, huh? Without me. Well, I don't like it, and it ain't the way I aim to have things.
Concierge! What's that? Is there an armoire in that room? What? I said is there an armoire in that room? Of course there is.
Work, no work. Is there a job I haven't done? All different, all the same. Spray painting, lead painting. Lead painting's no good, just like the sand gun. When I couldn't fight it anymore, I just gave in.
The elevator will get you up in three minutes. You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you. Thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. - Beautiful, isn't it?
You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you. Thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. - Beautiful, isn't it? - Yes, it is.
I do not hold your frivolity against you. As basic material, you may not be bad. But you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. I feel very sorry for you. But you must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles. Look at it.
It's.... Please. What do you see? I see a house. Looks like any other house. - What's remarkable about it?
I see a house. Looks like any other house. - What's remarkable about it? - It's not the structure. It's the spirit that dwells within it. It has three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
How is this one? Two men are looking at the moon. One of them says to the other: "Is it true that a lot of people live on the moon?" The other one says, "Sure it's true, about 500 million." Then the first one says:
There's one around here somewhere. It has a little knob that you turn. - A little knob, that's right. - Yeah. Maybe it's in here. - Just a little knob.
- You should be more careful. - And you, too, Ninotchka. - About what? - Ever since you've been back from Paris-- I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
- What good material. - Naturally, it's not the Royal Suite. Comrades, once and for all, we are in Moscow. Yes, there's no doubt of that. Just look out of the window and there it is. And it's great.
It's marvelous. It's wonderful. Just see how happy the people look from here. Can you blame them? At least the May Day parade is over. That's another thing.
Do your duty. Goodbye. I shall do my best. How do you like it, Ninotchka? Isn't it wonderful? - Tell us, Ninotchka. - Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski--
I shall do my best. How do you like it, Ninotchka? Isn't it wonderful? - Tell us, Ninotchka. - Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski-- Now, please don't start figuring it out in cows.
It's in the air. It may come around the corner... - when you walk down the street. - It may step out of a bazaar. It may be waiting for you in a corridor. It may hide in the shadow of a minaret.
- How do you do? - Clem came to wish me happiness. - Yes, of course. - By the way, I almost forgot. I brought this for you. Funny.
Yes. It was expected she might die as her father did, wasn't it? Yes, I thought everyone knew that. You did, didn't you? It's in her family, isn't it? I thought everybody knew that too.
It's something I've thought since the two of you came here to be with me and Tina began calling me Mommy because Dee did. I'll adopt Tina legally. Adopt? You adopt Tina? If she has my name, the Ralston name and part of the Ralston fortune... - Why haven't you mentioned this plan?
OK, she's open. - Let 'em fly. - OK, Tex. Joe! That's the most wonderful thing I've ever seen. Yes, reminded you of a great, beautiful bird, didn't it? It didn't at all.
- Let 'em fly. - OK, Tex. Joe! That's the most wonderful thing I've ever seen. Yes, reminded you of a great, beautiful bird, didn't it? It didn't at all. That's why it's so wonderful.
- There's no such animal. - Now, how do you know? The girl I was telling you about came as close to it as anybody I ever met. But one night when I was lost in a fog and was glad to get back down, what do you think the welcome-home speech was? She'd hoped I'd crashed. - What? - She couldn't stand the gaff.
- Now, how do you know? The girl I was telling you about came as close to it as anybody I ever met. But one night when I was lost in a fog and was glad to get back down, what do you think the welcome-home speech was? She'd hoped I'd crashed. - What? - She couldn't stand the gaff. Said she'd rather see me dead, have it over with.
- Where do you keep those pictures? - What pictures? Those pictures of you as a baby. - We're right back where we started. - That was a million years ago. - What's the matter with your foot? - I slipped on the porch. - Don't walk around on it.
"But I do not owe her the duty of attendance upon her. And had I that duty, Her Majesty's conduct has canceled it. As for asking her pardon, why should I ask pardon for receiving an insult? " Stop it! No. No, go on.
With Baganold's forces in Ireland, isn't he? -You want him home again, I suppose? -Oh, more than anything in the world. He shall be recalled. I don't know how to thank Your Majesty. But it's doubtful if he'll come.
Wars, death, famine in that unhappy land. And for what? A few miserable acres of fever-smitten bog and handfuls of tattered peasants whose only desire is to be left in peace to cut each other's throats. Well, they may. I'll put an end to it. Not another man goes to Ireland.
We're returning immediately to London. My dear Sir Walter. Well, well, well. You're even more splendid than I'd imagined. Even in my retreat, news came of that silver armor of yours. -I was ill.
Surely you can do so little for one who loves you so well. Will you promise? Promise. I promise. Now we must go and talk of Ireland. This deficit has grown to alarming proportions.
That we don't doubt. It's a difficult, dangerous job so how can we blame Lord Essex for refusing to risk it? You challenge me to go? Give me the men I need. Put me in command. If I fail to crush Tyrone, take my sword.
I beg Your Majesty's pardon. Yes, Your Majesty. It was I who intercepted your letters. They couldn't have done it without my help. Essex, thinking himself forgotten turned against you, but it wasn't his fault. He didn't know.
You must not be here when he comes. You sent for me. Yes. You spoil me for death. Wouldn't it have been kinder to have left me with my thoughts? Are you so set on dying?
But the crowd is stirring. With a wonderful landing Jurieux has arrived safely. The crowd has invaded the airfield and wants to break through. I'll try too. The Minister couldn't be here but he wishes to express his admiration and sincere congratulations. It's mainly a matter of equipment.
-I got it today. It's a romantic black woman. The mechanism works. Have you heard what André Jurieux said? I can well imagine how it went. He was going to risk his life. How could you have refused him this small mark of loving friendship that he must have been begging for?
If only I had my rifle. -Why? I love squirrels. -They're nice but very damaging. Here, look. How beautiful!
-A bullet. -From a gun? -A gun. A gun bullet. Does it surprise you? -Christine has disappeared! -She disappeared.
Here. Try this. Now, stoop down. Don't let it fall. That's the way they teach you in dancing school. I don't know.
You're getting a little mixed up with your feet. Maybe I'd better show you how it goes first, and then we can dance together. - Maybe that would be better. - Now watch me. Now with me. You must be very fond of that piece. They've played it every time we've danced.
- Sue and Little Chief are on the warpath. No more dance. Squaw laugh. I'm awfully sorry. Honest. I won't do it anymore. Please don't stop dancing.
I came to see Mr. Big Eagle, but they won't let me talk to him. - You shouldn't have come. - I had to. Mr. Standing sent to another post for help... but they can't get here in time, so after dark tonight... he's coming with a few men to try to rescue you. But he's afraid that if the Indians see him coming, they'll- - I have to see Mr. Big Eagle somehow, before it gets dark. - It won't do any good, Sue. It will.
They won't charge if we leave them alone. What's that? That's just an okapi, Mrs. Lancing. Okapi? Never heard of it. A very rare animal.
What's that? That's just an okapi, Mrs. Lancing. Okapi? Never heard of it. A very rare animal. The old-time hunters used to think it was a cross between a giraffe and a zebra.
We buried the child with his mother. Our entire family will be very grateful to you. I can show you the grave now, if you'd like. Thank you. Whenever it's convenient. We shall be about here for a day or two.
Don't you, Sande? I really don't see how it concerns me. There's an established custom in dealing with those matters. Established custom? If it's ivory the party's after... the hunter in charge usually gets 10% of whatever they bring out. Very well.
If I Only Had a Heart Picture me A balcony Above, a voice sings low Wherefore art thou, Romeo? I hear a beat How sweet! Just to register emotion Jealousy, devotion And really feel the part
I can't budge her an inch! This is a spell, this is! It's the Wicked Witch! What'll we do? Help! Help!
And their hearts are no bigger than yours. But they have one thing you haven't got. A testimonial. Therefore, in consideration of your kindness I take pleasure at this time in presenting you with a small token of our esteem and affection. And remember, my sentimental friend that a heart is not judged by how much you love but by how much you are loved by others. It ticks! Listen!
I think that it that it wasn't enough just to want to see Uncle Henry and Auntie Em. And it's that if I ever go looking for my heart's desire again I won't look any further than my own back yard because if it isn't there I never really lost it to begin with. is that right? That's all it is. But that's so easy! I should've thought of it for you.
And I tried to get back for days! There, there, lie quiet now. You just had a bad dream. Remember me your old pal, Hunk? And me Hickory? You couldn't forget my face, could you?
Yes. Run along now, children. But, Sylvia, darling, who told you? A manicurist? Go on. This manicurist, she's perfectly divine, she said to me: "I know something about rich Mrs. Haines." But, Sylvia, suppose Mary should hear about it? Wouldn't it be terrible?
I don't like that. Howard wants me to go on a world cruise. - Oh, isn't that adorable? - It's divine. - Don't tell me, but how much is it? - Two hundred and twenty-five.
- It's divine. - Don't tell me, but how much is it? - Two hundred and twenty-five. - It is a nightgown, isn't it? - Yes. I'd be glad to wear it for an evening gown. Isn't she naive?
- I'll get it back for you. - Please don't bother. Mary, how humiliating. Mary, you poor darling, I could die for you. What's the matter? I don't want it.
Good afternoon. This is Miss Trimmerback from the office. - She's a notary. - How do you do? I brought the inventories of the furniture. Mr. Haines wants to know if he can have the portrait of Little Mary. - Oh, yes, but it's in storage.
Mary, could I see you for a minute? Certainly, dear. As my last official act in Reno, I'm going to prepare the supper with my own little hands. - Lucy, any mail? - Here it is, my lady.
- Nothing. It turns into a bathroom. Then another time it turns into a kitchenette. Another time into a fireplace. You can't light it but it looks awful cute. - What turns into a fireplace? - This gig in the corner.
Oh, it doesn't matter. I wish they'd get it over with. You start thinking about that $25,000, or even the $5,000... - Or anything. - You said it. When you've got it right in your mitts, they leave you with your tongue hanging out.
This is my fiancée, Miss Casey. Well, let that be a lesson to you. What is so funny about that? What is the meaning of this demonstration, Mr Waterbury? I demand an explanation, and it had better be good. It is very good, sir.
- Hello. - What's that? - Is this the Davenport your ma wanted? The crank fits on here and when you turn it it... Makes into a full-size double bed at night. Guy said it works swell. What did you go get that for?
- What's that? - Is this the Davenport your ma wanted? The crank fits on here and when you turn it it... Makes into a full-size double bed at night. Guy said it works swell. What did you go get that for? Well, we kinda hoped that it might make up for the... phoney telegram.
The dinosaurs were lords of creation for about 200 million years. And then... Well, we don't exactly know what happened. Some scientists think that great droughts and earthquakes turned the whole world into a gigantic dustbowl. In any case, the dinosaurs were wiped out. That is where our story ends.
No, you don't understand. A tenderfoot is an easterner. Out West, they shoot at anything that looks Eastern. They'll blow his head off if he goes out West with that flea incubator. What's the matter with that hat? It cost a lot of money.
Our slogan is, "The customer is always right." Say, did you see something flying across here? Might have been a pigeon. - No, it wasn't a pigeon. It was green. Must have been a frog.
Sure, we're honest. We always pay. Here, I owe you 10 cents. Joseph Panello. That's rich and rare. A business transaction, Joe.
- Dan Wilson? Sure. You just go half a mile up the road. You can't miss it. Say, you can do me a favor. I got a telegram for Dan Wilson.
You just go half a mile up the road. You can't miss it. Say, you can do me a favor. I got a telegram for Dan Wilson. You can deliver it and save me the trip. Sure, we'll deliver the telegram.
- That's all right. Dan Wilson. That means we don't open it. You promise? Right. All right.
Blowin' the land away. Blowin' the crops away! Blowin' us away now. Are you crazy? Some say I am. You wanna hear how it happened? That's what I' asking you, ain't it?
Them folks gotta eat. First and only, I think about my folks. What happens to others is their own lookout. Yeah, but you don't understand, son. This is my land! Used to be.
Good wages, eh? Picking oranges and peaches? - Well, we aim to take whatever they got. - What's so funny about that? What's so funny about it? I've just been out there.
Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am? This ain't a grocery store. We got bread to make sandwiches. I know, ma'am. Only, it's for an old lady. No teeth.
- Anybody ask anything? - No, ma'am. - Well, you stay by that door. How's it feel? Busted my cheek, but I can still see. - What did you hear?
Do they know... what the fellow looks like? They know he got hit in the face. I' sorry, Ma. I didn't know what I was doing any more than when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was going to do it. Oh, it's all right, Tommy.
Playing pool tonight, Your Honor? You know, funny thing happened to me the other day. I'm playing the 12-ball for the side pocket and the blue ball's right in the way. I look over behind the eight rock, and do you know what happened to the eight rock? Come in. Come in.
Why don't we have dinner together sometime? I'd be glad to, Mr. McGinty, anytime except tonight. You know, if you told anybody we'd been living like this just down the hall for six months, neither one of us ever given the other one a thought, they wouldn't believe it. That's right. Even if it was true, they wouldn't believe it.

White marble, maybe. Or do you like pink? What do we need a State Capital building for? What do we need it for? This one is falling apart. Look.
Madonna, what are you going to do? I don't know yet. heaven is far away, and empty is the night. in a dark chamber my heart is awake it sleeps and waits, wondering where the dream may carry it do you hear, my heart? do you hear, my heart? it finds the way by the power of the stars it finds you and happily laughs my heart

It brings good luck. I've been a reporter for 20 years. I never heard that. Neither did I. I know it sounds silly, dear, but do it for me. Yes, yes, right now. All right. Just a minute.
Bruce something. - I give the marriage six months. She won't be able to be away from the paper any longer. Did you see her when that bell went off? It must be pretty nice to be able to walk out of a place and quit. I had a publicity job offered to me last year.
What's the story? I'll give it to you. But first I have to tell you I gave him money. And it wasn't exactly mine. It's Bruce's money and I want it back. Bruce's money?
I can handle things. I'll take that certified check too. I'll give you the tickets. You'll find your money in the wallet. My wallet? This is my wallet. Say, there's something funny going on... What are you doing?
What am I going to do? How can I ever face Bruce again? - Look at me, Hildy. - I am looking at you, you murderer. If it was my own grandmother, I'd carry on. - You know I would, for the paper.
I was here when that girl jumped out the window. Get the mayor over here. Look, madam, be honest. If you were out joyriding plastered, or got into a scrape, why don't you admit it instead of accusing innocent people? You ruffian! How dare you talk like that to me! He's just crazy, Mother.
Are you going to let them hang me? What do you mean by that, Leslie? You could get the letter. Do you think it's so easy to do away with unwelcome evidence? Surely nothing would have been said to you... ... iftheownerweren'tquiteprepared to sell it. That's true.
She's not afraid of anything. This was a pretty serious mistake... ... andsherealizedit. Who has the letter? Hammond's widow. And she threatens to turn it over to the prosecution. Well, what if she does?
When did you first start doing lace work, Leslie? A few years ago. How did you happen to take it up? I had nothing else to do. It appealed to me. It must take enormous concentration...
A few years ago. How did you happen to take it up? I had nothing else to do. It appealed to me. It must take enormous concentration... ... andpatience. I find it soothing.
Leslie, darling, this time you must let me have my own way. I won't be a minute. What are you going to do? -What can I do? -Don't tell him. I can't bear any more. You heard him. He wants the money to buy the estate. -He can't. He hasn't got it. -Give me time. Where's the letter? I have it in my pocket.
It would break his heart. What shall I do? I wish to heaven I knew. If only there were some other way. Tell him and have done with it. Now, this is really a handsome estate.
I'm not sure I can accept that. What do these other expenses amount to? Well, the principal item is that letter of Leslie's I mentioned to you. Yes. I'd almost forgotten about that. -You were going to... ? -l had to pay a great deal of money for it. Well, if you thought it necessary, I'm not going to grouse.
I sent for my large bag. We can put some of your things in it in case your bag is crowded. In fact, I'll pack for you, if you want. I know how you hate it. Darling, you've done something to this sleeve. A cigarette burn. That's what it is. And your new coat too. Never mind.
Do you fancy the weapon? I know very little about it, my dear capitán. Swordplay is such a violent business. (CHUCKLING) So, this bird killed the black-breasted red? - Yes, Your Excellency.
A man should consider his wife. Inez has... Inez has gone crazy over the idea of Madrid. She's been at me night and day to take her there. This should do it. This should suit that maniac.
Sit down. They're friends of Junius. And they expect to stay here? I think that's queer, indeed. - It's queerer than that. It's paranoiac.
You drew a blank. You wanted to. Mr. Connor, what would you...? A nice story for Spy, incidentally. Too bad we can't supply photos of you. The fuss you made over that childish episode!
- None of which I've got. - None. You have a good mind, a pretty face, a disciplined body doing what you tell it everything it takes to make a lovely woman, except the one essential. An understanding heart. Without that, you might as well be made of bronze. That's an awful thing to say to anyone.
Well, Macaulay, if you ever happen to find out... I'll tell you. Sure. And remember, Mike with the rich and mighty... Do you know what time it is? It's after 4.
Yes. With his both arms full of something, and guess what it turned out to be. - What? - You. And some clothes. Wasn't it funny?
- Hello, Connor. How are you? - Just about as you'd think. - You seen Kidd? - I left a copy of it at my house for him. - And?
That's not even conversation. But never in my life not if I live to be 100, will I forget how you tried to stand me on my feet again today. - Oh, you? You're in great shape. Tell me, what did you think of my wedding present? I like my presents at least acknowledged.
I'll tell you again, good riddance to me. - Your attitude is difficult to understand. - Yes, I can see that it would be. - Not necessarily. - You keep out of this. You forget I am out of it.
- Oh, Liz, I... - Oh, it's all right. We all go haywire at times. And if we don't, maybe we ought to. Liz... You see, it really wasn't Tracy at all, Mr. Kittredge.
The Captain wishes to justify what, in plain words... is a desire for plunder with no respect for the interests of Spain. The interests of Spain do not command my respect... -as they evidently do his lordship's. -I protest! Capt. Thorpe, you will at least show the proper respect for my ministers. So you have taken it upon yourself to remedy the defects of Spanish justice? Insofar as it lies within my power, yes, Your Grace.
You're wonderful. But you are too much. Bring the drinks. No, thanks. I'm on the grape-juice wagon. Antro.
Well, you shouldn't have. It was entirely my fault. I know. Sure, Bijou is only a little bitty baby. A baby? Does he laugh by the hour, or is it piecework? You had a good laugh the other night too, didn't you?
Oh, that admiral's coat. Where did you? Can't you do something about it? - What's that? - Oh, that? Uh, nothing. Uh...
You've got no right to be an officer's wife! You fool! You don't know what you're talking about! When he thinks of all the years he's been in the Navy and all he's worked for has gone by the board, he's gonna hate your insides. You can't get the Navy out of your heart and your blood, honest you can't. If he didn't kill you, you'd do it yourself.
Yes, Mr. Matuschek. Yes, Mr. Matuschek. I can buy two dozen of these cigarette boxes at Miklos Brothers. What do you think of it? I think it's great. Well, open it. No, Mr. Matuschek, it's not for us. But you haven't listened to it.
1,000 pengo? But, Emma, I don't understand it. Only last Monday I gave you... No, I'm not complaining. It's quite a bit of money. Yeah, all right.
I'm busy. You'll have to see me later. - Pardon me, sir. - What is it now? Sir, for several days your attitude toward me seems to have changed. - Has it? - Yes, Mr. Matuschek, it has.
- One of those imported pigskins? - That's what I was thinking of. You can't miss. If I would get such a wallet, I would be one of the happiest men in the world. On one side... Here, I'll show you. On one side, I put a picture of my wife and on the other side, my little baby.
How they been for you, Irish? I still get my check every Saturday. But you get ordered around every other day. Ain't for me. Hey, Red, this steak's tough. You can't send it back now.
You owe us 300 bucks and you're gonna pay us now! - If you don't...! - All right! Don't get hot. - I'll give you a check. - What'll we do, use it for a tire patch?
- Sure. - What is it, and how much does it cost? - Joe says he can't make our party. Sure you can. It's our new house. I want you to see it.
- All right, tell her, not me. - Just wait till I see her. Just wait. - What's the matter with you? - That door it opened. - Of course it did. We broke the ray.
The doors made me do it. Yes. The doors made me do it. The doors made me do it. The doors made me do it! - Matron, remove the witness.
A blind man cannot tell truth from false. Alas, I cannot tell day from night. It was my dog. - How can a dog tell bad from good? - See for yourself. Now, by the wonder of Allah -
Quickly, quickly! Oh, I can't bear to be kept waiting. Ooh. This is exciting, this. If Your Highness would wind it yourself. What's it going to do? Hmm? Move its legs, or arch its neck? Or - Or wag its tail?
- And now? - Pull the reins! I am no longer a man. I am a bird! I'm the king of birds! No! Oh.
I am no longer a man. I am a bird! I'm the king of birds! No! Oh. Mmm, I want it! I want it. I must have it, and I'll give you anything you wish for it.
Since you left your palace, I have kept you safe. When you rode hopeless and lost in the desert, who guided you? When you were sold in the slave market, who bought you Always Jaffar. It was in my house you were cared for, to sleep your sleep... and dream to its end... your first dream of love. It was I who woke you. No.
I want you to run this editorial in a box on the front page. This morning's front page? That's right, Solly, that means we'll have to remake again. - Go down and tell them. - All right. When you're through with that, I'd like to have it back. I'd like to keep that particular piece of paper myself.
You never should've married a newspaperman, they're worse than sailors. I absolutely adore you. Charles, even newspapermen have to sleep. I'll call Mr. Bernstein and have him put off my appointments till noon. What time is it? I don't know. It's late.
You're colossal, stupendous. Come on, alley-oop. I gotta wash behind your ears. You ought to be proud. You're a success. Look! A peanut. Come on, eat it.
Come on, alley-oop. I gotta wash behind your ears. You ought to be proud. You're a success. Look! A peanut. Come on, eat it. It's got lots of vitamins.
Thank you. This is a very unusual type of duel. It comes from Trinidad. The southern part of Trinidad. Pardon me. Thank you.
Your hat. - Clementine. - All right. Give it to me. - I'll give it to Madame. - No.
- All right. Give it to me. - I'll give it to Madame. - No. I have to give it to her personally. This way.
Give it to me. - I'll give it to Madame. - No. I have to give it to her personally. This way. Are you noticing how it drapes?
- You must sing for us. - We can't wait to hear you. - Oh, no, please. - We won't take no for an answer. - Charles. - I order you to sing, my dear.
Shh! I'll take it. He's not to be disturbed. - It's very important he gets it. - Why? Have you read it?
In fact, a concentrated banquet. - Does it have bacon and eggs in it? - No, but it has essence of guinea fowl. And spirits of spinach. Go on, it's good for you. No, boys, I'm going to eat food.
Look out! - It's all right. It's only a dud dead. - A dead dud. - See? It's all tarnished. Won't that make a pretty souvenir after it's polished?
It's all tarnished. Won't that make a pretty souvenir after it's polished? Look, it's full of powder. Hey! That's Private Meeley's tobacco! So it is.
Won't that make a pretty souvenir after it's polished? Look, it's full of powder. Hey! That's Private Meeley's tobacco! So it is. I'll take it outside and sift it.
- Strange? - He's too happy. You know how he was before he went into Watson's malady? I'll never forget it. That was terrible. - Say, Ollie. - What?
That was a dollar bill you gave me. I thought it was a 5. Even so, you counted 10. You'll never get rich... I know the song. Anyway, what's money? - Mere scraps of paper.
- You mean you got a date with him? Yes, I'm sorry. I made it just a moment before you came in. How do you like that? He ain't even a first-class private. I think he is.
Where've you been? We've been worrying about you. Do you know it's after 8:00? I've been taking a lesson in photography. Well, you seem unusually happy about it. I am.
Yeah. And they're showing a Mickey Duck. Thanks a lot, boys. But I have a date with Ginger. Daniel, you shouldn't go out with girls. It's dangerous.
And they're showing a Mickey Duck. Thanks a lot, boys. But I have a date with Ginger. Daniel, you shouldn't go out with girls. It's dangerous. It might affect your heart.
Thanks a lot, boys. But I have a date with Ginger. Daniel, you shouldn't go out with girls. It's dangerous. It might affect your heart. It has already.
Come on. Get going. - You know what, Ollie? - What? I feel like a mouse. We had to do it.
- And who are you, may we ask? This is Blue Army, and you're our prisoners. Pleased to meet... All right, come on. Pile out of there. - What will we do?
Yes, sir. -Thing at 31 6? -I... . 316. They've got no money or insurance. It's murder. Tough luck, Pfiffer.
Thank you, Dadda. Out of the house and across the street, as I had run a hundred times before. Softly now, for respect for chapel was the first thing my father taught us. Then straight to Mrs Tossal the Shop, for that toffee which you could chew for hours, it seems to me now. And even after it had gone down, you could swallow and still find the taste of it hiding behind your tongue. It is with me now, so many years later.
And having a civil answer. I have been busy with the union. Unions are the work of the Devil. You will come to no good end. At least I am not sitting on it, talking rubbish in chapel. - Look here...
- To hell with the wrath. And I'm saying it plain to be heard. 'Tis good. With honours, then. Our son is a scholar. What is it, Huw? I can't make sense with it.
- That's 2,000 I owe you. I wish you wouldn't do that. I'm sure if you tried once more... No, thanks. I'd rather pay 32,000 than lose a really large amount. This is very embarrassing. Just make it out to cash.
- Just pop them in the umbrella stand. - Very good, milady. Thank you. I'll probably talk like a cockeyed duchess the rest of my life. It won't even take six weeks. One day about two weeks from now, we'll be riding in the hills, past waterfalls and mountain greenery, up and down ravines and around through vine-covered trails... till we come to a spot where the scenery will be so gorgeous,
Go ahead and talk. Hello? Yes, Horace. I'm sorry, Eve. He won't do it. I thought it was a pretty fair offer.
Hello? Yes, Horace. I'm sorry, Eve. He won't do it. I thought it was a pretty fair offer. As a matter of fact, I think you're a sucker to make it.
[Intercom buzzes] Hello, Sid? I think I'm going to have to tell a coroner to go to blazes, Sid. Can I hide behind the sanctity of my client's identity secrets and whatnots all the same, priest or lawyer? But Dundy's getting a little rambunctious, and maybe it is a bit thick this time. What'll it cost to be on the safe side?
I did not mean that I have the money in my pocket but I am ready to get it for you on a few minutes' notice anytime during banking hours. That's probably true. He only had a couple hundred when I searched him this afternoon at my office. I shall be able to have the money for you at, say, 10:30 in the morning. But I haven't got the falcon. I'll have it in another week at the most, though.
No, Sam! No! That's the one I got from Kemidov. I swear it! You. It's you who bungled it. You and your stupid attempt to buy it! Kemidov found out how valuable it was!
BRIGID: How can you do this to me, Sam? Surely, Mr. Archer wasn't as much to you as... [Brigid sobs] Listen. This won't do any good.
Very cheap. It costs you two guineas on Regent Street. You should have that and put it in the gentleman's heart, no? Is it real silver? Better. It's chromium.
- Oh. I present you with this dangerous weapon, mademoiselle... with my undying gratitude and admiration. May you never lodge it in the wrong heart. - There you are, sir. - One pound, 20 shillings. I give you change.
Africa is one continent I know better than all their invisible men. - This the, uh, ooftish? - That is the money, yes. If you don't mind, we'll check the amount. No, no. I'll just take £500.
If you don't mind, we'll check the amount. No, no. I'll just take £500. And, uh, Saul, you can instruct her how to deposit it. - Very good. - I don't want it.
- He won't. He'll address it to, uh- to... your name. Mr. Stokes. Mr. Stokes, care of the post office at Lyme Regis. - Lyme Regis. - Uh, have you got a pencil?
I'm so glad you had the sense not to break out while I was sealing you up. - Now you cannot get out. - You can't get in, you mean. I have no desire to enter a cave after a trapped animal... even though I know you have no weapons. I admired your stone door so much that I imitated it... by wedging another stone on the outside. You're sealed up, as in a grave.
My purpose was to trap you alive. You've been Immensely helpful. - What is it you want? - Now you're being sensible. - Have you got It? - What Is It?
Oh, Certainly. Take your time. - Have you got a cigarette? - Yes. Certainly. It's on the stick. Pull It In.
Your time is nearly up, Thorndike. Hand out the document. You'll have to reach for it. Hand it out through the venthole. Your time Is up. I'm waiting.
Hand out the document. You'll have to reach for it. Hand it out through the venthole. Your time Is up. I'm waiting. And be sure It's signed.
You'll have to reach for it. Hand it out through the venthole. Your time Is up. I'm waiting. And be sure It's signed. There It Is.
I'm depending on you, Sammy. I'll come back with it signed, Mr. Custer. Take me to the room. Mr. Smith, it's me, Sammy, from the office. Mr. Custer says you'll have to sign this. We can't keep postponing the case.
I'll come back with it signed, Mr. Custer. Take me to the room. Mr. Smith, it's me, Sammy, from the office. Mr. Custer says you'll have to sign this. We can't keep postponing the case. Push it under the door.
- Could I see you a moment, please? Just a minute. Good night, David. Your nose is bleeding. Are you sure that stuff is good for a nosebleed? Best thing in the world.
I got some information. I only got a couple of minutes. Mr. Charles isn't here. Can you give it to me? No, I gotta give it to him. I'm going away, see?
He wasn't exactly one of nature's noblemen. Really? Well, how nice. - A camellia doesn't have any fragrance. - It doesn't need any around you. I'm glad you like my perfume. It's new.
- I wanna give this to another girl. - Nicky! I found this hidden in Barrow's apartment. While I was there, Miss Porter came in. She'd been there before. That's a lie!
I said, where did he live before that? He live in apartment 32A. That's right, at the top of the stairs. Well, gentlemen and ladies we have our murderer. Nicky, I can't stand it! Was it me?
He live in apartment 32A. That's right, at the top of the stairs. Well, gentlemen and ladies we have our murderer. Nicky, I can't stand it! Was it me? Yeah, Nick, is it her?
I'm gonna go trapping there. Not and live under this roof with me, you ain't. He's been worrying himself half-crazy over you, Ben. Well, he won't have to no more. Please don't go thisaway. He'll get over it.
You needn't get mad about it. Here. - I ain't no place to hide it. - Tom says I was to give it to you. I'd be scared to hold all that. I ain't never had no money.
I ain't never gonna believe you again. Never. You gotta trust me. Ain't I always told you the truth? Ain't I kept money for you? I ain't gonna touch it. Keep the money or throw it away.
Don't reckon you need to wait for no invitation. - What's wrong 'tween you and him? - I can't tell you. How come? I couldn't stand it if you got down on me too. Is it something you done?
It's a problem they've been trying to settle for hundreds of years... and they haven't settled it yet. At least they hadn't when I left. What else do they have in the civilization, Mother? Lots of things. There's the radio, for instance. It's like a box, and you can hear music and voices coming right out of it. You mean the box can talk? Not really.
In the river where we swim. I see. Is there any more of it? There's lots of it on the bottom. Lots of it. What do you do with it?
If I could be just sure. We have some medicine that might help. Sulfamyradol. It's a new drug that works wonders in cases such as this. - Elliott's already sent a runner for some. - Where?
Well, so long, Henry. What's the matter? - Supper ready? - Supper? What about that wood? Well, there it is, can't you see it?
What's the matter? - Supper ready? - Supper? What about that wood? Well, there it is, can't you see it? How come I can still see it?
How come I can still see it? How come you didn't sell it? Well, you can't sell no wood if nobody wants to buy no wood, can you? You're the craziest old fool I guess I ever did see. That's the fourth time you've taken that same load to town and brung it back. Ain't even had it out of the car.
How many, Ada? Oh, about 17, 18 head. And there ain't one of them worth the powder to blow them up. How much rent would it be, Payne? Hundred dollars for the year. Hundred dollars?
Shove it. Just shove it out of your way. Yeah. I told you you could do it, Dude boy. Oh, ain't this a pretty automobile? Oh, I knew you could do it, Dude boy.
- As I was coming up the road there I seen a load of cut wood over in that field and I said to myself: "Wouldn't it be smart if I was to haul that wood to Augusta and sell it?" Why, that's Henry Peabody's wood, ain't it? - But he ain't here. - I know, but it don't seem just right. Wait a minute.
Why, that's Henry Peabody's wood, ain't it? - But he ain't here. - I know, but it don't seem just right. Wait a minute. I ain't stealing it. I'm just figuring on selling it and giving Henry half of that money.
Dude boy, Dude. Dude. What are you doing? Why, this durn old top didn't wanna go down! - Did you hurt the car much? - Oh, not the running of it. - And the horn wasn't hurt none.
- What is it? - Come here. Say, you wanna buy a brand-new automobile cheap? - This one? - Yeah, it's brand-new. It ain't been hardly broke in yet.
Hey, wait a minute. This ain't no poor farm. You won't ever see no poorer farm. Why, you made a mistake. This is my place, boy. Maybe I did, but I had to do it.
Fine. Fine. - I took an interest in your work. - Really? So much so that this morning I was walking down Fifth Avenue I saw something rather beautiful that reminded me of you. I wanted you to have it very much, and so I bought it for you. This couldn't be a diamond bracelet, could it?
- This couldn't be a diamond bracelet? - Open it. "To my dear, sweet Sheila." The funny thing was that when my wife found that in my pocket she thought that I was the one who bought it for you. How could you possibly think such a thing? Because I know Martin.
"To my dear, sweet Sheila." The funny thing was that when my wife found that in my pocket she thought that I was the one who bought it for you. How could you possibly think such a thing? Because I know Martin. Do you like it, Sheila? Like it?
- That's because you're a good teacher. What's wonderful about you isn't anything I taught you. What's wonderful about you is you. That's bracelet talk. Sure it is, but not the way you think it is. That bracelet happens to mean an awful lot to me.
What's wonderful about you isn't anything I taught you. What's wonderful about you is you. That's bracelet talk. Sure it is, but not the way you think it is. That bracelet happens to mean an awful lot to me. It brought us together.
What's wonderful about you is you. That's bracelet talk. Sure it is, but not the way you think it is. That bracelet happens to mean an awful lot to me. It brought us together. Well, that's one way of looking at it.
The son of a gun bit me! Oh, Mr. Curtis. You frightened me! What do you think you did to me? What are you doing here? This happens to be my apartment. I'm sorry. I didn't know.
Well, Maggie, there it is. It's wonderful. I think it's a fine play. Honestly, Maggie? You telling me the truth? It's better than that. I think it's great. May I take it with me?
It's wonderful. I think it's a fine play. Honestly, Maggie? You telling me the truth? It's better than that. I think it's great. May I take it with me? I wanna read it again myself. Sure.
Where have you been all night, playing house with Bert Jefferson? I had the most wonderful evening. I've been ice-skating for the first time. I'm the first person to do a figure eight from a sitting position. We are not amused. Bert read me his play. It's superb. It's not just a play by a newspaperman.

Sherry, my sweet. How are you, darling? Lorraine, my blossom, I have the most wonderful news for you. I've been reading the most brilliant play with an enchanting part in it for you. - Why, you're on-stage every minute. - Darling. What? Darling, why do I have to come there?
No, Mr. Whiteside, I am taking boxing lessons. Dear Mr. Whiteside, I've been trying all day to see you to give you this. Why, Miss Stanley, a Christmas gift for me? Oh, it's just a trifle. But I wanted you to have it. It's a picture of me as I used to be.
Dear Mr. Whiteside, I've been trying all day to see you to give you this. Why, Miss Stanley, a Christmas gift for me? Oh, it's just a trifle. But I wanted you to have it. It's a picture of me as I used to be. It was taken on another Christmas Eve many years ago.
Just what is all this about, sir? Is it possible that men of your apparent intelligence have not heard of the "Inflato"? You see, we've been out of town, haven't we, Ollie? - Inflato? - Yes, the name of this little device. Inflato, taken from the word "inflation."
- While you wait. Now, if you gentlemen is serious, I got to go and report this. Give it another whirl, Ollie. Let me try it. Wait a minute, maybe I... Let me try, see if I can't get this thing...
Oh, Stanley. Stanley. Oh, Stanley. Well, what happened, sir? - Somebody slugged me. - Oh, well that's too bad.
We're in the desert. I was misinformed. Excuse me, Rick. A gentleman inside has won 20,000 francs and the cashier would Iike some money. - I'lI get it from the safe. I'm so upset. You know-
Play it once, Sam. For old time's sake. I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa. Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By." I can't remember it. I'm a little rusty on it. I'll hum it for you.
Shut up and go home, will you? No, sir. I'm staying right here. They grab Ugarte, then she walks in. That's the way it goes. One in, one out. - Sam. - Yes, boss.
- A little something of my own. - Stop it. You know what I wanna hear. - I don't. You played it for her, you can play it for me. - I don't remember-
- Stop it. You know what I wanna hear. - I don't. You played it for her, you can play it for me. - I don't remember- - If she can stand it, I can.
Mostly, I remember the Iast one. The "wow" finish. A guy standing on a platform in the rain with a comical look on his face from his insides having been kicked out. Can I tell you a story, Rick? Has it got a "wow" finish? I don't know the finish yet.
We're all out here for the same reason. Dough. Sure, that we are, but it's good to know every check you cash in... ..means a jap's cashed in too. Wait a minute, fellas. We're all making the same salary: 600 bucks a month and 500 a jap, right? Back home most of us would kill rattlesnakes whether there was a bounty on them or not. But you're protecting your home. This is not our home. It's not our fight.
- Darling, I swear I never... "Darling, I swear." You lie. If you don't... You're on. Take a bow. So this is Holiday Inn. Yeah, will be if it ever opens up.
Are you hurt? I'll check later. Come on, let's get out of this before you catch cold. All right. Oh! Well, here's what cooks. Oh! Why, this is darling.
If I see her from the back again, I'll recognize her. It's kind of a roundabout way to go at it, but let's try it. i Are you decent? Yes, come in. What's that? Well, I thought it over, and I believe our number would go better in blackface.
What's that? Well, I thought it over, and I believe our number would go better in blackface. Oh, I thought we were gonna do it like this. Well, that was before I... before I thought it over. I'll look terrible in the stuff. No.
Beautiful. "Be careful it's my heart." And I ain't kiddin' either. I wrote this just for you, honey. ♪ Be careful ♪ ♪ It's my heart ♪ ♪ It's not my watch you're holding ♪

- Well, I only have ten, but here. Give it all to her and take her anyplace she wants to go. I'll pay you tomorrow. For heaven's sake, be good. What'll I do with the coat? When you're through with it, send it to the police.
Keep calm. Estelle! Estelle! Now, you get back in that body. No. I didn't like it.
I don't and I'm not. - He's feeling better lately, aren't you? - I missed you at the office. Tax payments have been coming up against the old Timberlake-Fitzroy Corporation. There's no sense in throwing money away on a dead company. This statement says the corporation's dissolved.
But the strong must protect themselves or go under. I'll protect myself, never fear. What are you going to do? Are you going to let them...? I'll never stand in their way. Craig's a lawyer.
- You? - Me. Love me? Peter, I've got a surprise for you. Where'd you get it? Ask no questions.
Roy hasn't a car. Perhaps she'd like to use it. - No, thanks. - I quite understand, my dear. Besides, it is Stanley's car. It's just standing idle in the garage.
He's gone. He's dead. Stanley, don't torture yourself. Life and death happen. If it hadn't been for me, he'd still be alive. He'd still be alive.
- I won't be here. I'm going out. - Oh, well, good night. - Good night. What is the matter, Stanley? Stanley, what is it?
My, how very formal. - May I sit down? - Yes, please. Craig, I've got a favor to ask of you. Would you explain this to me? It's Peter's.
But it was. I mean, in a way it was. Because, you see, I'd come in from a drive and instead of taking the car to the garage as I usually do I left it out front. - You see, he was going to wash it, but... - Oh, Stanley, it wasn't. It couldn't have been.
Where does it come from? Who does it! Why, I suppose pretty much everybody I know. It's pretty general. - Who said so? - Wha? - Well I hardly think it would be fair to give names. - Look here. One of your best friends is that mother of Charlie Johnson's across the way. - Has she ever mentioned this to you? - Well she may have intimated it...
You shall have happiness, and only happiness. I promise you that if you take heart for it, I'm saying too much for wisdom, I fear. But oh my dear, won't you be strong? Such a little short strength it would need. don't strike my life down twice, dear. This time I've not deserved it.
I wouldn't use five cents, no matter how tired I was. Oh, for gosh sakes will you get up! Don't sit there with your back against the boiler. - Get up, aunt Fanny! - It's not hot, it's cold. The plumbers disconnected it. I-I wouldn't mind if they hadn't!
Something had happened. A thing which, years ago, had been the eagerest hope of many, many good citizens of the town. Now it came at last. George Amberson Minafer had got his come-uppance. He got it three times filled, and running over. But those who has so longed for it were not there to see it.
Only Lajarie could believe in it. The other evening he was sure about it. Yes. He's always sure in bars. It's later, making it happen, that it's difficult. What's that? Leave it. I took it from a friend with dark thoughts.
The money, a great life, security... Women love security. You're doing it again. Gloria... I won't say it again, Gloria. Sorry.
Thank you. You won't be needing me again, Mr Decrey? - No, thank you. - At your service. I had the photos. One of them in particular hurt me.
Don't shout, Jacques. It scares me. The bracelet you gave me for our 5th anniversary, I lost it. I was still kidding myself. For a moment, I thought she'd tell me everything. She'd actually pawned her bracelet for money.
- What's up? - No one came. They're getting fed up. And they're trying it on. It's only human. They're going back tomorrow.
You're not the first to do that. If it helps, I think he, too, wonders who he is. Yves is a bird in a tree. A bird is nice, it sings, whistles, preens itself, but you're not sure where it will land. Oh, shit. I can't do these baby clothes.
It's strange no one went the day the Corsicans kept watch... as if the blackmailer knew he'd be caught. Who did you tell about the trap apart from Yves? - Be logical, my girl. - No. That's impossible. It's impossible. It's despicable.
- No, I'll go. Be careful, my dear. Don't catch cold. Did you find them? It was you. Gloria, please. Gloria, open up.
It's on the floor above. When I was 17, I came in once after midnight. That tread hasn't been fixed since. She locks her door. Make a note of it. Significant, isn't it?
I'll show Lisa around the place. You can show the rest later. - Meet me outside? - I've been thrown out of better places. This morning I referred to a quotation, remember? Yes, Walt Whitman's.
- Yes, thank you. Good. Will you excuse me to send a cable to my wife? I should have this morning. Isobel gets nervous. Of course.
The Christus statue. Serves me right for getting a car because I liked the driver's face. - It doesn't matter. - We promised to meet Deb for dinner. How much farther is it? Don't look, just listen.
I don't think I'll do anything that will displease you but from now on you must give me complete freedom. Including deciding what I wear where I sleep, what I read. Where did you get that dress? Lisa and I bought it in New York. Outrageous. Where's the black and white foulard?
Whoopee! Hot diggity! Hello. Give me Longacre 56599, please. You see, it's strong and safe. It's simple and practical. It lets the light and air through and it's practically invisible from below.
But to build a working model in some field or village somewhere that small planes could actually land on to prove that it was practical, would only cost about $99,000. After that, we'd be on velvet. You see, it's a steel mesh made of stretched cables. Every municipality, every town, every city needs one. My patent is basic. $99,000 is a lot of money.
No reason. Is that so? He just... $700 just like that? Just like that. I mean, sex didn't even enter into it. Oh, but of course it did, darling.
The Wienie King? Oh, no. At his age, darling, it was really more of a blink. Really? This is very illuminating. Well, you don't have to get rigid about it.
I mean, of all the filthy things I've heard in my life, I still... How does he want it? In cash, maybe? In cash. So I won't stop the check, the scoundrel... I don't mean me, I mean that whoever's... Well, I don't think he'll ever get it.
All my husbands were foreigners and such chatterboxes I could hardly get a word in edgeways. They make a handsome couple, don't they? Pardon? My sister and your brother. It would be nice if something came of it. Oh, yes, wouldn't it?
They make a handsome couple, don't they? Pardon? My sister and your brother. It would be nice if something came of it. Oh, yes, wouldn't it? It would be wonderful for him.
They want to bake a cake, dear. They want to bake a... I don't know what to say. I didn't realize it was so humorous. Did you really want to put me through all that? I'm afraid I'm...
They want to bake a... I don't know what to say. I didn't realize it was so humorous. Did you really want to put me through all that? I'm afraid I'm... There's no use trying to conceal it now.
I'm delighted to have the opportunity. Look... Darling, I have the most wonderful news. Snoodles is going to build your airport for you. Why should he build it? I'll build it.
Oh, he isn't really. I let you think much worse about him than he is. You know how a woman likes sympathy. But what about the $99,000? He didn't want that, I wanted it for him. But...
Hello there, Snoodles. How's every little thing? I'm very unhappy, as a matter of fact. You'll get over it. You know about Gerry's decision? Yes.
- Are you afraid he'll get hurt? No. I'll let you in on a little secret, Josie. That night I took you to Pittsburgh's party I wanted us to prove something for keeps. I wanted to prove that you could look Pittsburgh in the eye and laugh at him. That he could take you in his arms, you could still laugh, and mean it. We did prove it, didn't we?
I wouldn't believe a word you said if you swore it on a stack of Bibles. I'm goin' whole hog for the miner. I'm gonna make Pittsburgh... the greatest town to work and live in in America! Nah. The boat sailed, Pittsburgh, and you're not on it. Nobody'll ever like or trust you again. We'll see about that. I'll make 'em like me.
Sam feels it's too risky taking you. I think perhaps he's right. I think perhaps you should go back to the asylum... until you're all well again, and then... Go back? It is best, Smithy. You need care, and you need doctors that understand your case.
Do you mind if I rush off now and tell Smithy? He'll be so happy. A thousand thanks, darling, and goodbye. Smithy, it's all right. Isn't it wonderful? Sam's all right. Now you have nothing to worry about, nothing.
- You did. - I? Probably someone congratulating you upon becoming a father. Aren't you ever going to tell me what's in it? I can't believe it. It's fantastic. Darling, please, I can't stand it another second.
- I? Probably someone congratulating you upon becoming a father. Aren't you ever going to tell me what's in it? I can't believe it. It's fantastic. Darling, please, I can't stand it another second. It's from Liverpool, from the editor of The Mercury.
"'Industrial Prince of England..." "'Mr. Charles Rainier."' Hello, nuisance. My word. Do you like it? My dear, you look adorable.
Why don't you? Just to be curious. I haven't said that I don't. Oh, no. Would it be too incredible? - It would be fantastic.
Just to be curious. I haven't said that I don't. Oh, no. Would it be too incredible? - It would be fantastic. - Then it is fantastic.
- Social secretary? - Not exactly. You know... it seemed quite a reasonable idea when it came to me. But now, I'm rather losing my nerve. Why? Is it so startling? It may sound outrageous to you, but it's not a sudden impulse.
Nook? I guess we can find a cranny somewhere for you. Better leave word who to notify in case there's any suddenness. Come on. It's port. That's larboard to me.
If he gets rough, tap him with this. He's singing to you, Lumpy. Singing like a seal. Heave him over. - Jack, that paper has your name on it. - What?
Then you knew her! Yes. I knew her. Jack. Was it Drusilla? Yes.
If I should happen to be late for supper, just see that Romulus doesn't overeat. There's a squall coming up. It won't give you many minutes. Yes, and Romulus doesn't like fish much, either. Bolt the faceplate home. The wreck moved!
Why, I saw him! I saw him twice! Ken saw him too! He was with us at the fire. He handed me the extinguisher. Ken said, "Don't I get to play too?" He was kidding. I handed it to him. Fry was right there with us, I'm sure!
Hello there. Hello. I got caught in this storm. I'm pretty wet, I'm afraid. Maybe you'd like to come inside and get dry. Did you leave your car down on the road? Put it in the shed.
All right. Let's get goin'. Get all the things together. After we leave, I want this place cleaned up. You won't be coming back here. Why not? You think they got the place spotted? I'm making sure. You'll have to find another place and store all this stuff. It's not gonna be easy.
Get all the things together. After we leave, I want this place cleaned up. You won't be coming back here. Why not? You think they got the place spotted? I'm making sure. You'll have to find another place and store all this stuff. It's not gonna be easy. If you can't handle it, I'll have to get someone else.
Now, if you'll give me your address in New York, Miss Martin, we can contact you back there. Or maybe you could wire me which plane you're taking. We may want to get ahold of you fast. I can do that when I get back to my uncle. Okay. Just keep in touch. I'm glad we came this way. It adds a few miles, but I've become a little sentimental. I want to take a last look at it.
New York. What are you handing' me? Oh, no. You see, I work in a store downtown. I never get a chance to get out. I just sit around all day, and I never see anything. So I said, the first vacation I get, I'm going to see the Statue of Liberty. This must be a big moment for you, huh? Oh, it is.
Is that correct? Pardon me. Hello. Yes. This is Miss Eberli. Why...why someone must have stolen it.
On Richmond Bypass? Yes. Yes, I'll arrange to have it removed. Yes. At once. Now I can be frank with you, Mr. Holmes. Dr. Tobel has disappeared. They found my car on Richmond Bypass wrecked.
Thank heavens for that. Look after him will you Hoffner? I'll take him to the car. Well, I expected you but not with my revolver. You realize, of course, when I was brought into the room blindfolded - I heard the mechanism of this door. - Of course.
For me I'm British and I'm proud of it. Nobody is gonna call me a Nazi and get away with it. Well, help me then. Tell me what Christopher means. Well, don't anybody know? Its got to mean something.
All our available resources must be rushed immediate. Withdraw material from elsewhere? If need be, yes. This calls for action and lots of it. There's something curious about this broadcast. He said tomorrow.
pile right in. In fact, you can have my chair. I just cashed out. No luck? - Percentage is with the house. Pretty hard to beat. But it has been done, hasn't it? So they tell me.
You mean a court order? -Yeah, that's what they call it. We've got a different name for it. - My uncle must have signed it. Which doesn't make it so funny. - Why not?
You're still wearing it, I see. It's becoming. You've grown into it. And what's that? - It's the coffee boiling. - Take it off.
Wonderful. - Ever had borscht, professor? - What's that? Beet soup with sour cream. It's a Polish dish. With an egg in it.
It's a Polish dish. With an egg in it. Don't let anybody give it to you without an egg in it. - We must have some, Miss Shelley. - Of course. As soon as I finish my course in American cooking...
- Spoil Joseph? - Yes, sir. - Borscht, please. - A quart. - Yes. With an egg in it.
Listen, you blow your horn at 7 tonight right outside, sonny. Will you stop walking around and lie down for a while? I can't figure it out. Why can't 100 policemen find one man with a bad ankle? What the dickens is that to you? Nothing.
That's all right, Tilney. A whole chicken. He has an enormous appetite. Will somebody listen to me? Bracken's alive. Why should Dilg go to jail?
Tell your pals we're here to trap lions. We'll get them. Place kind of gives me the willies too, Buck. Queer, wasn't it? The way it suddenly shot up above the clouds? Another couple of feet, we'd smack right into it. - Still looks like Africa to me.
You know I'm never any good unless I have my peace of mind. Maria, be honest, be frank. I've got to know. Did you tell that fellow to walk out of my soliloquy? Sweetheart, darling, I love you. Don't you know that? Don't you feel it? If anything happened to you...
Maria, be honest, be frank. I've got to know. Did you tell that fellow to walk out of my soliloquy? Sweetheart, darling, I love you. Don't you know that? Don't you feel it? If anything happened to you... You think I can do it?
I offered to see her to the village and... then suddenly I - I felt something coming at us from all sides at once. We heard it. Kate screamed and dropped the lantern. Then I-Then it-it-it closed in on me like- like a blast from a furnace. Only it wasn't hot, it- it was-
- I felt something coming at us from all sides at once. We heard it. Kate screamed and dropped the lantern. Then I-Then it-it-it closed in on me like- like a blast from a furnace. Only it wasn't hot, it- it was- It was simply horrible.
We heard it. Kate screamed and dropped the lantern. Then I-Then it-it-it closed in on me like- like a blast from a furnace. Only it wasn't hot, it- it was- It was simply horrible. Kate screamed again and... then I was fighting it.
It could have been a ferocious dog, of course. Those poachers have a couple of huge, vicious hounds. Look here, darling, why don't you forget about this tonight and try to get some sleep? I'll run along. I'm sure by tomorrow the police will find out what it was. I've done it, Bob.
To tell you the truth, I never took it very seriously. Seems rather like flying in the face of fate... - in view of what happened to your ancestors. - Superstitious rot. Superstitions are often based on fact. If you want to know more about it, there's a family history in the library. Thanks. I'll have a look at it.
- Yes. - I've seen that look of yours before, young man. I'm willing to wager that you've about got your man. - I'm not convinced it is a man. - A woman? Animal, vegetable or mineral?
That shows the spectrum analysis of wolf's hair. - And here's the one I found. - It's incredible. Well, Inspector, that blows up your spook theory. What's happened? It was sealed in this tube and vacuum.
- And what can that prove? - One of two things. Either you injected the cobra venom into Kate O'Malley's veins... or you deliberately withheld the information... that venom was in the system at the coroner's inquest. There was no reason for mentioning it. Had no bearing on the case. She didn't die from the venom.

In Miss Helga's room. - Where is it? - There! - Christy! - Oh, Bob. For a moment I thought you were the monster. Quick.
You could put that in the report. It was a form of mania that caused its victim to imagine- consciously or subconsciously - that he was a werewolf. That book telling the history of the family had a hint in it. Oh, so you were the one who stole it. Yes. Yes, I'd hoped to keep you from finding out. That their ancestors were balmy?

Oh, so you were the one who stole it. Yes. Yes, I'd hoped to keep you from finding out. That their ancestors were balmy? Well, let us say, rather, that their ancestors... handed it down from father to son throughout the ages.
- This is our dump. See, Tess is my wife. What do you know! That's wonderful! Oh, don't take it wrong, Mrs. Craig. I'm just so excited.
What did the doctor say? - I haven't seen the doctor. - You've got to see the doctor. You gotta stay off your feet, you know... Tess, I hope it's a boy. - Oh, you sweet...
- I haven't seen the doctor. - You've got to see the doctor. You gotta stay off your feet, you know... Tess, I hope it's a boy. - Oh, you sweet... - It is a boy.
And the sorrows of each, the sorrows of both. If you wish your new estate to be touched with lasting beauty cherish those gracious visions of your first love. Let them not be blurred by the common events of life. Be not moved in your devotion. Believe in the ideal. You saw it once.
Where's your money? Got paid off a lot of cash. Now, wait a minute. We're not leaving without it. I've had experience. Hand it over. Tell you where his money is if you're so anxious.
Making water, sir. We've started the bilge pump. We can keep her under control. All right. Send a man forward to secure the bulkhead. All hands to the cargo winch! Bring your guns to starboard and hold fire.
What do you think? - No. - And then could we please be sailors? No! - And finally, maybe we could be Marines? But did that discourage them?
Explain! You can't proclaim Sisters for petting animals. - They pet the Devil! - That's nonsense. It's true, that beast came to hurt us. It's an innocent animal.
Beelzebub proudly walks around. Look in his eyes, see a path of lies and hypocrisy! Sister! A bluebird used to come here, it brought joy and sincerity. And a toad that made us feel compassionate. Mother St John's cat ate them.
- My family! I gave up that world. Sending me back is unfair. My dear child... I loved the world I left. You don't know how much I loved it. I ripped it from my heart to come here.
Isn't he light? In the head. Wonderful. What's it called? That is called the "Dance of the Pelican" my own original creation. Now, girls, we'll try some bar exercises. Right over here.
The other will use this. He's the croaker, makes examinations and certifies the chump as being a sound insurance risk. Any questions? Mickey, you draw Chambersburg. You can take Jasper along as your croaker. Croaker?
Unless you scramble them. I wouldn't be that stupid. You know, I knew a fella once. He had some money in the bank, and he wouldn't draw it out. And you know what? He lost his job.
We use it all the time. - Wait till you see this. - Just sit over there. This is really something. All ready? Now, we'll dirty it up a little.
It's the only way the enemy can bring up reinforcements. Tanks, artillery, troops, all must come over this bridge. I must know it is gone. Not before the attack, they'd rebuild it. It must go the minute the attack starts, no sooner, no later. So the bridge is nothing.
- See? Very practical. - He catches rabbits. If a Gypsy catches rabbits, he says it's foxes. - If he catches a fox, he'll call it an elephant. - And if I catch an elephant?
Then he saw a rabbit and went after it. Fine time to go hunting! Primitivo, climb up that rock as high as you can. If you see soldiers, throw a stone for a signal. Wait a minute. - If you see one soldier, raise your rifle like this.
- I need you at the bridge. - I know it. - Have you been through before? - Yes, Twice. - 8 hours, nearly 9 hours. - Can you make it to Navacerrada? - I can try.
When I stirred up the fire for coffee, I found it. - What? - It was under the ashes. - I thought you were guarding it. - I slept with your things! - You slept well!
- I'm sure I saw him. - You haven't seen anyone. - I'm certain I have. - You haven't seen anyone! Father, you don't have any connection... No, monkey, hardly. I've been politically disconnected for over 15 years now. You tell it to A... A entrust it to B, B confines in C...
Raise the invisible torch and pass it along... Keep it burning, keep it forward on the road that has no turning. Die if you must, for a cause that's just.. but shout to the end: 'No Surrender'. Carry on, when we are gone. No surrender!" Of course you could made that a lot better. No, my friend... let's have it just as it stands. Fellow patriots, there's work to be done. Raise the invisible torch and pass it along... Keep it burning...
- l've told you many times. I'm always sorry. I bet you'd like to know what I'm going to give you for your birthday. - l'm dying to know. - Something to wear. - Let's see now. ls it a tie? - l'm not telling. I'll give you a hint.
How are you feeling? - (coughs) - That's fine. Morning, Mother. - Good morning, Henry. Mother, I want you to look at this. - Do you think Martha will like it? - Oh, it's beautiful.
It's the very danger itself, Paul, that makes the cure possible. Insulin produces a state of coma. Then the patient is revived by a violent shock to the nerves. That shock can kill, but it can also cure. I don't know. It's a hard decision to make, but yours is only a technical responsibility. Technical responsibility. Real responsibility. The question is, will she live or die?
Haven't I? I suppose I take it for granted. - It's just part of everyday life here. - You don't believe in it? A missionary's widow? Isn't very likely, is it? I don't mean believe in it like believing in a religion.
- It's just part of everyday life here. - You don't believe in it? A missionary's widow? Isn't very likely, is it? I don't mean believe in it like believing in a religion. I mean, do you believe it has power?
Why, I think Miss Cowan should open it... since she will someday be the owner of the property. Why, I don't understand it. I put that money in the envelope and sealed it. It was never out of my sight until I put it into the safe. He's even used a copy of the Daily Planet. He never dropped it on the floor?
I'm not that dumb. We were taken. This pair's crooked. Where's Wright? That money belongs to Miss Cowan. You know very well you stole it from her mother. Why, you.
What is your name? Claudio. Erique Claudio. Claudio. No, no, no, it wouldn't be there. It's a large manuscript in a portfolio.
Oh, but it must be here. If it is, it will turn up. Call again in a few days. You don't understand, mademoiselle. It's the only copy I have. It represents two years' work. You heard what the lady said.
If it is, it will turn up. Call again in a few days. You don't understand, mademoiselle. It's the only copy I have. It represents two years' work. You heard what the lady said. But it was brought into this office.
It doesn't lend itself to self-expression. I didn't recognize that delightful song you were singing, Christine. But as you know, I am no connoisseur of the opera. It's not from an opera, Raoul. It's a lullaby. A lullaby.
Fire a couple of shots in front of them. That ought to turn them back into us. That's a British Sudanese with an Italian prisoner. I think he's gonna fight us. Give me something white to wave. Make it snappy.
There's still some water dripping! Quick! Something to catch the water! It's going to waste! Waco, get some cans and some ropes from the tank. Heads up. Here it comes.
You will go with Sergeant Krause's advance party. Show them the way to Bir Acroma. The battalion will follow in an hour. We must get water. How's it coming? Very good, Sergeant. Very nice.
Show them the way to Bir Acroma. The battalion will follow in an hour. We must get water. How's it coming? Very good, Sergeant. Very nice. Any way to squeeze it out quicker?
The battalion will follow in an hour. We must get water. How's it coming? Very good, Sergeant. Very nice. Any way to squeeze it out quicker? It takes its own time.
You got a job. Frenchie, let the Italian come around here. Yes, Sergeant. Let me take your place for a while. No, it isn't necessary. How's it coming?
No place. Just the Army. In my village, we had the finest cheese in the world. - What kind of cheese, Frenchie? - It is from my village. Never heard of it.
Suppose we send those two Germans to tell them there's plenty of water here. Suppose we hold them up for two or three days while they're trying to get it. There's just one thing wrong with that plan. Here we are. Here are the Germans, and here's what happens. You hit it right on the nose.
If it's our duty to try and delay this column, what's the talk about? Just give us our orders. That brings us down to cases. I look at it this way. Because it is a 100-to-1 shot. Because there's so little chance of any of us coming out of it.
- Yes, Sergeant? - Got her filled? - Pretty sure of yourself, ain't you? I like to travel. It broadens the mind. I wish you weren't so cocky about it.
We aren't surrendering! Water? You're giving guns for water! Go ahead! There it is! Drink all you can find! Go on, take it!
Go ahead! There it is! Drink all you can find! Go on, take it! There it is! Roll in it! Swim in it!
- I know it is, but what one? You know, it's the funniest thing. Sometimes I get a tune in my head like that and pretty soon, I hear somebody else humming it too. I think tunes jump from head to head. Do you know whatit is, Uncle Charlie? Uh, no.
Did you ever see a house made out of newspapers? Well, watch. You-You take one sheet here. OK? And you tear it down here. And you tear it there. You fold it over here at the side. Fold over the other side here.
- Aren't you on our side? - Yes, Sally. Then why don't you do something. Because Captain Vickery will be much safer in the local police station tonight than he would be in this house. Oh, Mr. Holmes, what am I going to do? Watson, get your sedative.
Handy little things. As my heir. Sally has to recite a sort of formula over Geoff's body in front of the fireplace and the library in the presence of the entire household. There, that's better. Just what sort of formula? Oh, it's some meaningless words, Musgrave ritual, they call it.
- Can you remember the words? - No, no, not at all. But you had to speak them when you're brother Geoffrey took over. Yes, that's right, I did. Let me see now. "Who first shall find it were better dead
But you had to speak them when you're brother Geoffrey took over. Yes, that's right, I did. Let me see now. "Who first shall find it were better dead Who next shall find it perils his head. The last to find it defies dark powers."
Let me see now. "Who first shall find it were better dead Who next shall find it perils his head. The last to find it defies dark powers." "Who first shall find it were better dead. Who next shall find it perils his head.
And perhaps you can tell me how you come to know the Musgrave ritual by heart. - Me, sir? - Yes, you. When Miss Sally forgot the lines today you were the one who prompted her. Well, sir I memorized it. Obviously but why?
- Quite. There's only one thing to do, search the room. Not the room, Watson. Her mind. We must search her mind. Obviously, she took great pains to hide that paper.
Oh, but she never left the chair. I'll kiss the book on it. I've got it. She must have packed that paper under this cushion. She must have changed her mind. Obviously.
I'll kiss the book on it. I've got it. She must have packed that paper under this cushion. She must have changed her mind. Obviously. Well she could have hidden it anywhere here.
This place used to be known as Hurlstone Towers. "Neverfield and King's Hargrave Anno Domini 1539." What we're looking for is underneath here that's what the ritual meant by deep down low. It's a burial crypt. Up with it. I say, there's somebody down there.
"Neverfield and King's Hargrave Anno Domini 1539." What we're looking for is underneath here that's what the ritual meant by deep down low. It's a burial crypt. Up with it. I say, there's somebody down there. Who is it?
Who is it? Is it Brunton? Is it Brunton? I don't know. Stay where you are. Who is it, Holmes?
I grant you. But it wasn't easy to let you take my gun away from me without seeming to hand it to you. That's why I let you take the torch first. I knew you'd snap it off. Yes. We told you, you were taking an awful risk. Well we had to have a confession and these egomaniacs are always so much more chatty when they feel they have the upper hand. Shall we go?
It looks like an old land grant. It's really a crown grant. What I don't understand is why the Musgraves didn't claim the land ages ago. Obviously Watson, one of 'em died before passing on the meaning of the ritual to his heir. The words remain but the sense was lost. I wonder why he left the grant down there where he found it.
That's right, U. S. A. Now why would Pettibone want American match folders in his work? And a microscope, most interesting. What's this? Watson this microscope was last used for examining microfilm. I'm beginning to see the pattern.
Gentlemen they knew we are on the case as early as their attempt on our lives in London. They're much too intelligent to believe that a corpse would frighten a trained detective. No, I rather think they intended this as a message and they wanted to be sure that I'd be here at the Hotel Metropolitan to receive it. Message? What do you mean? They want us to believe that they found the document and therefore have no further use for Grayson. Well if that's true then we're done for.
Message? What do you mean? They want us to believe that they found the document and therefore have no further use for Grayson. Well if that's true then we're done for. I'm not so sure that it is true Watson. If they have the document why they wasting time sending me this? No.
Oh really, you don't say so. It only remains to translate them properly. Yes, just as I thought. This blanket has had a most varied history. It's been on a many a sea voyage. The latest not six months ago.
Awe, what a very interesting collection of pewter. That will be five hundred dollars. Now would you just give me the address where you want it sent? Mrs. J. Wellington, Junior, Duponte Circle. Good night.
Where's the girl? She's not here of course but you're quite at liberty to look around if you care too. Thank you. Interesting piece. Spanish isn't it? Moorish. Oh, my error.
Separate. How could we two separate? Think of all we've given to each other. Look at that tree. Yes, it bows in sorrow. No, in longing.
How could we two separate? Think of all we've given to each other. Look at that tree. Yes, it bows in sorrow. No, in longing. It grieves over us.
Then we hear from his cradle a little Martin crying. I pick him up. And as I found life at your breast he'll find life at mine. The tenderness you gave to me I give back to him. While I hum for him a song about us two. Isn't it lovely to think about? Yes.
The tenderness you gave to me I give back to him. While I hum for him a song about us two. Isn't it lovely to think about? Yes. It is only a dream. What does it matter?
I burned for someone to love. I dreamed of a little child to hold in my arms. Not even that did you give me. You asked if I ever wished you were dead. I have wished it hundreds of times. I wished it when you were with me.
I dreamed of a little child to hold in my arms. Not even that did you give me. You asked if I ever wished you were dead. I have wished it hundreds of times. I wished it when you were with me. I wished it when you left me.
Hmm? All right, well I didn't want every Tom, Dick and Harry handling his things. No, no, of course not, of course not. Ratty old chair, ain't it? Repulsive. Well, sir, there's nothing ratty about it. Perhaps you're right, doctor.
(knocking) Take your time with the packing, doctor, there's no hurry, you know. British Museum will still be there. (knocking) What's the row about? A registered package for Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Oh, he'll sign for it. Thank you, sir.
Why not, the man you sent me to advanced me five hundred pounds on my worthless policy and all I could think of was you. Please. I really shouldn't, but I must see it. Oh, how simply breathtaking. You like it? Why I'm mad about it.
I really shouldn't, but I must see it. Oh, how simply breathtaking. You like it? Why I'm mad about it. You must let me take it back to the jeweler, have it properly marked. AS or just Andrea?
He's onto us, Norman. Does he know that you're onto him? He does if he's the man I think he is. Don't be cryptic, darling. Look at that. What of it?
He must be a great comfort to you. Oh, he is. Cigarette? Thank you. Yes, isn't it? I picked it up quite by accident.
Oh, he is. Cigarette? Thank you. Yes, isn't it? I picked it up quite by accident. Wasn't a mark on it except some negligible fingerprints that the police couldn't identify.
No, it's alright. - He's a lush, huh? Keep out of this! It's between us. You got something to tell me... You're wasting your time. - You know what's going to happen to him?
Wait! Stop all this. Now look, how did he die? Mortimer, don't be so inquisitive. The gentleman died because he drank some wine with poison in it. How did the poison get in the wine?
You better go home! -But, darling, we were married today. -Go to bed, get some rest! Who? Judge Cullman? This is Mortimer Brewster. I'll tell you why I called you. It's about Teddy. I've got to come over and see you right away.
That's right. "A" like in "arsenic." Got that? Is there always this much noise? He doesn't live with us. I can see the headlines now. Please. I'd like to see the room.
No, we must keep it a secret. A state secret? Yes, a state secret. Promise? You have the word of the President of the United States. Cross my heart and hope to die. Now, let's see.
I'd better call and see if Witherspoon has left. I'll get every one of you! I hate cops. I'll brain the first one that comes near me! A little higher, brother. Thank you very much. Don't do that, please. That won't have any effect. I've tried it before--
I never wear them, either. What's that noise? Suppressed steam. Sometimes it goes on like that all night. - Really? - Yes. Maybe we'd better go to your house, huh? No, dear.
All you've gotta do is read the street sign. - What does it say? - I can't read it. I haven't got my glasses. - Here, hold this. I'll climb up and I'll see. - Never mind, I'll climb up.
I was getting it ready to send to Washington. Now, let's see, this knob. - Now, don't be frightened. Now, there, you'd hardly know there had been a spot on it. Gee, that's swell. That's a wonderful machine.
- I call it the Big Noise. - Why? Because, properly detonated, it would blow up this entire city. What do you want us to do with it? I don't want you to do anything with it, except to guard it with your lives. The utmost secrecy must be observed.
- Why? Because, properly detonated, it would blow up this entire city. What do you want us to do with it? I don't want you to do anything with it, except to guard it with your lives. The utmost secrecy must be observed. If the wrong people learned what I have in mind and it was discovered, it might alter the whole course of the war.
You had better retire to your room and relax. I'm a very busy man I'm working on an aeroplane that requires no wings. How does it fly? That's just what I'm working on. Good night. He must have given me the wrong key.
How does it fly? That's just what I'm working on. Good night. He must have given me the wrong key. - Let me try it now. Maybe I can fix it. - All right.
- Out in the car. Well, let's go. - I'll handle this. - Yes. Come on. That's deep enough.
- Good. Come on. Now, men, you're going to have an unusual opportunity for target practice under circumstances equivalent to actual warfare. At a deserted airfield, about two miles away there is an obsolete plane equipped with radio control and a robot plane. It will be flown directly over this battery and you will attempt to blow it out of the sky. All right, sergeant, start the plane.
All alone. The last to arrive on the glorious battlefield of Shiloh and the first to leave it! - You'll never live that one down, general. Never, ma'am. I made this myself, Mr. Cody. I hope you'll enjoy it.
There's your answer. You look beautiful. I wish your Indian brave could see you now. Indian! What is it? What did I say to offend you?
You look beautiful. I wish your Indian brave could see you now. Indian! What is it? What did I say to offend you? Please, I'd rather you kept it.
I wish your Indian brave could see you now. Indian! What is it? What did I say to offend you? Please, I'd rather you kept it. It was so becoming to you.
- He's upstairs, sir. No! What killed my son? Bill! Diphtheria. What's that?
Diphtheria. What's that? It's a germ. Where does it come from? From water systems. From sewage.
You should be a very distinguished- looking man 10 years from now. I might even like you better. I'll tell you tomorrow. That's all, brother. This is where you live, beautiful. Not me. Lend me your car for a while?
You think you're such a hot potato as a Claims Manager... such a wolf on a phony claim. Maybe you are, but let's take a look at that Dietrichson claim. Accident and double indemnity. You were pretty good in there for a while, Keyes. You said it wasn't an accident. Check.
Maybe you are, but let's take a look at that Dietrichson claim. Accident and double indemnity. You were pretty good in there for a while, Keyes. You said it wasn't an accident. Check. You said it wasn't suicide. Check.
- Right now? Sure, right now. - I'm crazy about you, baby. - I'm crazy about you, Walter. That perfume on your hair. What's the name of it? I don't know.
Don't mind him, Mr. Neff. And thanks a lot for the ride. You're awfully sweet. She was a nice kid. Maybe he was a little better than he sounded. But right then it gave me a nasty feeling to be thinking about them at all... with that briefcase right behind my head that had her father's signature in it... and what that signature meant. It meant he was a dead pigeon.
- Wait for what? Until he can take the train. I told you it's got to be the train. But we can't wait. I can't go on like this. Look, we're not gonna grab a hammer and do it quick, just to get it over with. - There are other ways.
I'm not crazy. I'm not hysterical. I'm not even crying. But I have the awful feeling that something is wrong... and I had that same feeling once before, when my mother died. When your mother died? We were at Lake Arrowhead. That was six years ago. We had a cabin there.
What would you like to have for breakfast? In the morning I really require very little. Just a little something. X is equal to negative P half plus or minus the root of P half in square minus Q the tangent one half ( Alpha plus Beta )... If the cocoa is not sweet enough for you... It's fine, it's fine.
Have you doubled it? But it's not genuine. Show me. On one end it goes back and forth, and on the other end it goes around. That is the connecting rod. Sometimes this kind of steam engine has two cylinders.
And leave it there. - What about a drink? - A drink? Well, you sure put us in a spot, didn't you? - Me? It was your idea.
- No. - You will be careful, won't you? - I will. Goodbye. Goodbye. Come and see me if you're ever in London. My name is Thwaites, Miss Thwaites. I'll point out the window of the room in Number 9 where it happened.
The whole thing is alive with happiness. I want a feeling of the early morning. - This morning. - Yes. With the sun rising, lighting your hair as it is now. I don't know how it ends.
Later. Now, where should we put all these things? There is an attic under the roof. All her trunks are up there and all her costumes. Then we'll put all these there, too, and then we'll board it up... so you'll never have to see it again, never even think of it. That piano traveled with her everywhere in the great days.
It belonged to my mother, and before that to her mother... and now it belongs to you. I shall wear it always. Always, my dear. How sweet of you to give me this. I'm afraid the pin is not very strong. - No.
A little while ago. Please see that he has plenty of coal on the fire in his room. You already told me that, ma'am. Nancy, did you turn the gas up in there? Turn it up? No, why?
Please see that he has plenty of coal on the fire in his room. You already told me that, ma'am. Nancy, did you turn the gas up in there? Turn it up? No, why? I thought it went down in here, as if you had.
Yes. The little picture has been taken down. Who took it down? - Why has it been taken down? - Why indeed? Why was it taken down before?
The little picture has been taken down. Who took it down? - Why has it been taken down? - Why indeed? Why was it taken down before? Get it from wherever you've hidden it and put it back in its place.
Why was it taken down before? Get it from wherever you've hidden it and put it back in its place. But I haven't hidden it. I swear I haven't. Why should I? Don't look at me like that.
I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid my wife's illness has returned. - Can I send for a doctor? - No. If I can just get her home. We shouldn't have come tonight, but she was so anxious. I'm so sorry, Lady Dalroy. I think it's the most...
Why? - The gas just went down. - You saw that, too? - Why, yes. Then it really happens. I thought I imagined it.
No, ma'am. I didn't see anyone at all. But he was here. I know it. I know it. But he was here.
I know it. But he was here. I know it! I saw him. You see how it is, Elizabeth? Yes, sir.
Come closer, Paula. Closer. Look into my eyes. If I ever meant anything to you, and I believe I did... then help me, Paula. Give me another chance. Look, in the drawer of that cupboard there is a knife.
Give me another chance. Look, in the drawer of that cupboard there is a knife. Get it and cut me free. Be quick, Paula. Get me the knife. Cut me free. Would you get it, Paula?
Look, in the drawer of that cupboard there is a knife. Get it and cut me free. Be quick, Paula. Get me the knife. Cut me free. Would you get it, Paula? Would you get it for me?
Get it and cut me free. Be quick, Paula. Get me the knife. Cut me free. Would you get it, Paula? Would you get it for me? Yes, I'll get it.
I can never find them. I don't know where I put them. That was a knife, wasn't it? And I have lost it. - Paula... - I must look for it, mustn't I?
I don't know where I put them. That was a knife, wasn't it? And I have lost it. - Paula... - I must look for it, mustn't I? If I don't find it, you will put me in the madhouse.
That was a knife, wasn't it? And I have lost it. - Paula... - I must look for it, mustn't I? If I don't find it, you will put me in the madhouse. Where could it be, now?
And I have lost it. - Paula... - I must look for it, mustn't I? If I don't find it, you will put me in the madhouse. Where could it be, now? Perhaps it's behind this picture.
- I must look for it, mustn't I? If I don't find it, you will put me in the madhouse. Where could it be, now? Perhaps it's behind this picture. Yes, it must be here. No. Where shall I look now?
- Hello. - Still looking for St. Dominic's. You just wait till I tell Father Fitzgibbon. Look, you keep out of this, will you? Go on. This is between him and me. O'MALLEY: Honestly, I'm sorry about the window.
- Still looking for St. Dominic's. You just wait till I tell Father Fitzgibbon. Look, you keep out of this, will you? Go on. This is between him and me. O'MALLEY: Honestly, I'm sorry about the window. Yeah, but being sorry don't fix it.
Carol, I didn't like the way you said, I'll get by. O'MALLEY: Here's something to tide you over. But, Father... It's all right. It's not charity. It's a loan. Thanks.
O'MALLEY: Here's something to tide you over. But, Father... It's all right. It's not charity. It's a loan. Thanks. I can use it.
I have bad news. I've been to the publisher. He wasn't interested. Wouldn't even look at it. Said they were loaded up. May I see it? - So you're still in trouble.
I've been to the publisher. He wasn't interested. Wouldn't even look at it. Said they were loaded up. May I see it? - So you're still in trouble. - Wouldn't even look at it?
- You bet he does. They say he's the sharpest little man in town. - I'm embarrassed. - You mean to talk business? The money? Don't let that embarrass you. We love it.
It's way over our head. You see, it's not just the type of song that a guy would... Pardon me, Father, that a gentleman... would croon to his babe, if you know what I mean. It doesn't say enough. It hasn't got that... Well, it's just not for me.
What for? Father O'Dowd and I thought, with your permission, we'd play golf tomorrow. I need a new golf ball. If I lose it, I'll swear off. I'll quit. Take 50 cents. No.
Quick! "The battle raged three days. "Eventually the Romans routed Hannibal's forces. "A great number were taken prisoner and brought before the consul. What is this? Using prohibited aids, Mr Widgren?
"A great number were taken prisoner and brought before the consul. What is this? Using prohibited aids, Mr Widgren? I forgot to erase it. "Forgot to erase it"... But of course...
I don't know... Tell me... Do you like me just a little? You see, I... Do you see that star? It seems to be hanging far below the sky on an invisible string.
Why, Daniel, I believe you're jealous. You love him, don't you? He's in some kind of trouble, I think. - I want to help him. - You do love him. But he doesn't know it.
Yesterday morning, after Laura's body was found, I was questioned by Sergeants McAvity and Schultz, and I stated, "On Friday night, Laura had a dinner engagement with me" "after which she was ostensibly going out of town." "She phoned and canceled our engagement at exactly 7:00." - After that I... - You "ate a lonely dinner," "then got into the tub to read." Why did you write it down?
"She phoned and canceled our engagement at exactly 7:00." - After that I... - You "ate a lonely dinner," "then got into the tub to read." Why did you write it down? Afraid you'd forget it? I am the most widely misquoted man in America. When my friends do it, I resent it.
- This is Lieutenant McPherson. How do you do, Lieutenant? I didn't know you were here, Mr. Carpenter. As a matter of fact, I was just lying down here. My hotel room was so hot, and then all the people and reporters and telephone. You know how it is, Lieutenant.
10:30 tomorrow, Bullitt and Company. You've got a job. I concealed my annoyance with masterly self-control, but I sensed a situation which would bear watching. Laura, take a look at this. Do you like it? Do you think it'll make people want to bathe more often? It should.
I'm sorry. I should have told you before. Shelby and I are going to be married next week. I believe you presented him with a cigarette case on his last birthday. Rather valuable, isn't it? Where did you get it?
You knew all along it was she who was murdered. Didn't you know Laura Hunt would come back any day and spill the whole thing? Or did you plan to kill her too, hide the body someplace and cover up your first crime? You're being fantastic, McPherson. You took a bottle of Black Pony to her house Friday night. I took it there over a week ago.
Thanks. No, I didn't kill Diane Redfern or anyone else. Then why... Why did you tell me the radio at your country place was broken? - Because it was broken. - Not when I tried it.
with both barrels, right in the face. She fell here. Waldo heard Shelby running from the next room so he hid in the stairway outside. Shelby was scared, so he ran out as fast as he could. Then Waldo came back and placed the gun in that clock. I knew it.
Mrs Porter lent you her coat to help keep you warm. It's a beautiful coat. - Is it real mink? - I hope so. It's lovely. I've always admired mink.
Quite so, if you want to be scientific about it. I'm a great believer in science. Like tears, for instance. They're nothing but H2O with a trace of sodium chloride. He likes you, but he hates the bracelet. You will have to get rid of it. - The bracelet? - Mm-hmm.

The national spirit could not be suppressed even by brutal force. Shortly thereafter, that spirit was to rise again. The glorious day had come, when the first Croatian opera was to be shown in the theater on St. Mark's square in Zagreb. Perhaps countess Rubido will be offended because we did not attend that famous premiere of theirs, but as the president of the Musical Institute, I cannot afford to support dilettantism. I am surprised to see the countess engage in such a frivolous undertaking.
Since the Prague Conservatory was unable to take him in, Lisinski took lessons at professor Pitsch's famous organ school. Even professor Kitl, the Conservatory director himself, gave composing and instrumentation lessons to Lisinski. During this time, "Porin", the second Croatian opera, was written. With the third act already completed, and having broadened his musical knowledge immensely during his stay in Prague, Lisinski returned to Zagreb full of hope. Gentlemen, please, just a few moments longer. We have come to the last item on our agenda.
Your Majesty, thank you. Good day, gentlemen. Your Majesty. You do like that tune, don't you? Oh, I love it. It's the Notre Dame victory song.
These cats sure can put it away. Yeah, it's lucky horsemeat ain't rationed. Ollie, look. Stanley, we've got to uphold the rights of human beings. That beautiful sirloin steak is enough for at least four people. And he's hoarding it.
Yeah, it's lucky horsemeat ain't rationed. Ollie, look. Stanley, we've got to uphold the rights of human beings. That beautiful sirloin steak is enough for at least four people. And he's hoarding it. Mrs. Hawkley needs it more than that lion.
Mrs. Hawkley needs it more than that lion. We'll do it. You're right, Ollie. Ladies first, I always say. Stanley. Get the meat. - You mean, me get the meat? - Of course.
I have it. I'll decoy him away from the meat, and you grab it. I'll pretend that I'm another lion. It's working. Pretend you're a lady lion. All right.
We better get our packages and go home. My first chance to cook a meal for the Hawkleys my famous Steak a la Oliver and no steak. I'm sorry, Ollie. - Look. - Look, the steak. Good boy, you got it.
My first chance to cook a meal for the Hawkleys my famous Steak a la Oliver and no steak. I'm sorry, Ollie. - Look. - Look, the steak. Good boy, you got it. How'd you get it?
Put them down. Why don't you try it on the other side? Well, I seem to have lost my touch. Stanley, a sharper knife, please. This one is very dull. The shortage of steel, you know.
And I've spoiled everything for you. No, no, Chris. Now, what you need is some sleep. Stanley, you wait here and I'll go and see if I can get a bed here for Chris. You seem awfully fond of that thing, Chris. I am. Knute Rockne gave it to my father.
No, no, Chris. Now, what you need is some sleep. Stanley, you wait here and I'll go and see if I can get a bed here for Chris. You seem awfully fond of that thing, Chris. I am. Knute Rockne gave it to my father. Put it under the pillow till morning.
But I'm not kidding. His Majesty is giving a tea immediately after the presentation, and I want you to serve it. You ain't kidding? I ain't kidding. I give you my word. Will you do it?
It's the biggest. Stanley, you may serve the special salad now. This one is His Majesty's. - Are you sure this is the largest one? - Of course it is. I picked it out myself.
I can't understand it. Stanley. That's for the guest. Leave it alone. And put that down. Now look what you've done.
We'll help you. Won't we, Ollie? And now, gentlemen and Christopher if I may trouble you to climb out on the ledge outside this window. Come, come, gentlemen, please. I'm a very sensitive man. I find this quite painful.
I'm not going to the flat. Oh, you'll be quite safe. I have him under lock and key. Now to business. What luck? See for yourself. I stuffed it with paper to stop it from rattling.
It still doesn't answer my question. What've you been up to? A little bit of hijacking, old boy. Reach into the inside pocket of that coat that you're about to throw aside. What do you find there? Pocketbook.
On the contrary, I'm afraid the greatest harm has been done. I beg your pardon. Are all the objects of art in this room connected with your protective system? Well, most of them but why? This Hogarth etching for instance, - is it connected? - Most certainly.
How could a little woman of that size break a man's back? Lestrade's an idiot. Well, what the dear public don't know, the dear public won't worry about. That's funny. I had it here a moment ago. Extraordinary thing.
That's funny. I had it here a moment ago. Extraordinary thing. Where can it be? I lifted it. Oh, what would Holmes do? I know, reconstruct the..
Easy does it. Light as a feather, ain't she? What did I tell you? Look at that, Lestrade. That china was broken after her dead body was flung there on the floor? But why, why was it done?
You'll find more chance at finding the clue you're looking for in the china cause there is much more china. And there's too much china, Watson and too little plaster, which leads me to suspect that the greater conceals the less and if the china was smashed to cover up the plaster. Curious notion. Oh, look. Bird. Matter of fact I had thought of it myself. Oh, did you really?
The Napoleon bust. Now we're driving about London looking at broken glass. Borgia Pearl... Here we are, sir. This is where I nabbed him. He was beating it along here like a frightened rabbit when I come up from behind and made the pinch. That isn't true.
Attend to the gentleman, Miss Benzenger. Yes, Mr. Hodder. Oh, mercy me. Here, here. What have you broken now? I never saw such a one for breakage. You aren't even worth half the wages you earn.
Yes. He's addressing a meeting of the Royal Canadian Occult Society at a Quebec hotel. It's urgent sir. Page. Yes sir. Lord Penrose. La Morte Rouge is on the telephone.
Pardon me. It's quite all right. Oh thank you. Murder is a very interesting story gentlemen. I will recall a short story by that brilliant author G. K. Cheston in which the murder is committed by a postman I refer of course to the invisible man. A brilliant bit of deduction on the part of Father Brown. I'm a postman.
Good day Judge and thank you. Good day sir. I'm sure Sergeant Thompson will have observed a man with a limp in a village the size of La Morte Rouge. This is what's left of the De Port Hotel Mr. Holmes. Tanner sleeps here when he's in La Morte Rouge. Spooky old place.
Good day sir. I'm sure Sergeant Thompson will have observed a man with a limp in a village the size of La Morte Rouge. This is what's left of the De Port Hotel Mr. Holmes. Tanner sleeps here when he's in La Morte Rouge. Spooky old place. Villagers call it the Wolf House.
Part of it's missing. Bravo Watson! Now if we can find the missing half... notice the discoloration of the torn edge, faded signature, the upper half was torn off some time within the last year I should say. Why all this fuss about an old photograph? Watson have you ever stopped to think that the science of detection is very much like stringing a hand full of beads? I can't say that I have.
He dropped it and I picked it up. You were gonna give it back to him, of course? No, I wasn't. - I don't like him. - That's a pretty good reason. Besides, I need boat fare to get out of Martinique.
- He rented my boat to fish from. - You mean he had rented it. The tickets in his wallet show he was to leave Martinique at daylight. There was no money on him or in his wallet. Only some American traveler's checks. Was that customary with him?
I've just been fooling with the lyrics. They're not so hot, either. Would you like to hear them? Sure. So it goes. - That's about as far as it goes.
I might have expected it. You're not sore, are you? - It'd be all right... - I got a refund on that ticket. Here. That's gonna help a lot.
- I'll be all right. Then take this. - What is it? - Chloroform. Get over by his head. If he comes to while I'm probing... pour some of it on a hunk of cotton and give him a whiff of it.
Be a good boy. - Goodbye. - Bye. - Goodbye. - Bye. - Goodbye. Just what is this, my dear? Well, it said coffee on the bag.
Spitting whenever a German goes by, cursing him. Why, that doesn't mean a thing. But blowing up a bridge, killing a whole trainload of Germans, that counts. A handful of peasants is a cheap price. It's breaking your heart because you know a couple. Jean. Let me put it to you this way, supposing you knew the saboteur? Supposing it was your brother or someone you loved?
- I'll pack it. - They're my clothes! You're not good at it. Your records are old. Don't listen, then! You're rich now.
- That's not very nice. Oh, you know... Micheline is doing a fitting. - Is your line ready? - I don't know... I think it'll be grand.
Tell them he's coming. Thank you. You seem sincere. Listen. There are things I never told women. They thought I loved them, or not. But I never said it.
I'm scared, Daniel. The train's gone now. Let's get out of here. Hurry up! This isn't all fun and games! - Is it going well? - Yes.
Here in the bushes. - Did you hear a shot? - No. - That's funny, neither did I. - Why, something happen? - Nicky, what is it?
The safety of this community couldn't be in better hands. - Who'd like some cider? - Nick. Oh, Nick, here's the bullet. I don't know about such things, but I imagine it was fired from a.45 or something in that general field. - Well, give it to Mac.
Hold it, you guys! Break it up there! My, my. Cut it out, will you? Come on. Give me the police department, please.
How do you do, Mrs. Draque? Well, you certainly got right down to business. I found her on the floor. She was out cold. Somebody had conked her before I got here. - What about the painting? - It's gone.
Now, let me think. Let's see. Peter Berton painted it. Everybody wanted it. Draque offered 500. Mrs. Draque got it. She got conked.
Let's see. Peter Berton painted it. Everybody wanted it. Draque offered 500. Mrs. Draque got it. She got conked. Let's see, now, who else wanted it?
Worried? Say, you are worried, aren't you? Oh, I've handled trickier shows than this. But your old man wasn't in the audience watching you. That's it, isn't it? Or part of it anyway.
- Mrs. Charles, where is your husband? - I don't know. Why don't you sit down and take it easy. I'll just make some cocoa to quiet their nerves. Cocoa? What a break.
I don't aim to get across any line because that's what she wants us to do. I worked that out before her mouth shut. - You mean there ain't no posse? - Sure, and it's probably trailing' us. There wouldn't be if she hadn't sicked it on us. Are you telling me that there pretty lady is a skunk?
Stay where you are. - Now, look, I'm sick and tired... - I'm gonna smoke a cigarette. When I'm done, I'm gonna throw it away. When I throw it away, take care of yourself. Some friend of this belly-bustin' gunman, I take it.
Just as you please. - Made up your mind? - Uh-huh. Well, where is it? - Where's what? - The money. Stop stalling.
Now they got a "corpus delict". - A what? - A dead body. That's the way the law says it. If they've got a corpus, you're delict. Before this, we could have proved there was a mistake.
No! That'll teach you to keep your mouth shut. Come on. Come on? Try any monkey business and I'll blow you clear outta this house. Where's that money?
You got something else on your mind. Yeah? Yeah. But I ain't gonna help you with it none. I'm gonna make you ask about it. All right.
Oh, it's cold in here. Cold, eh? - That better? No mortal cold, Sally. It's a cold from beyond the grave. What are you talking about?
- That better? No mortal cold, Sally. It's a cold from beyond the grave. What are you talking about? Believe it or not, this house is haunted. - I don't believe it.
- I'm becoming quite alarmed. By the end of this evening, I shall be just as credulous as any of you. Mr Craig, I can only say the more incredulous the doctor becomes the more I believe you. - Thank you. Doctor, I'd hoped you'd be able to explain to me a happening which, to put it mildly, has always puzzled me. I shall try.
It was April 9th, to be exact. I remember the date, because it was Peter's birthday. 'You know how difficult it is, choosing presents for a man. 'They always seem to have everything they want.' - Oh, hello, darling. - Hello, sweet.
'They always seem to have everything they want.' - Oh, hello, darling. - Hello, sweet. Take it through, will you? - What on earth's that? - Just a little birthday present.
You didn't get it at a joke shop, by any chance? No, of course not. Why? Well, when I was dressing this evening, just as I was tying my tie, What do you mean, "wrong"? Well, it wasn't my room I was seeing, it was some other room. - Darling! - I told you it sounded silly.
I'd really rather not talk about it. You'll feel much better if you do. It's no good bottling things up. Well at first, if I made an enormous effort of will, the reflection used to change back to what it ought to be. But lately, however hard I try, it doesn't change anymore. The only thing to do is to try not to look in it at all.
- Good morning, Miss Walsh I beg your pardon, Mrs Cortland. Do you remember that Chippendale mirror I bought here 3 months ago? Indeed I do. I hope your husband was satisfied with it. Yes, very. - How odd you should mention it.
Well, how's the great debunker going to debunk that? Ever since Mr Craig arrived, you've been asking me to produce scientific explanations like rabbits out of a hat. I am not accustomed to solving complex problems with the careless ease of your Brains Trust. Sounds to me as though you're completely stumped this time. Joan saw the room in the mirror as well as Peter. The witness I couldn't supply you with.
and a wedding gown. Hear that, Nathalie? It's contagious! Another pillar of salt. Ah, love! It cheers the heart. - Same old story? - Same old story!
- No, but they let rooms. - On credit? - If not, I'd live elsewhere. Are you sure you don't want the second-floor flat? No, really, a small room is fine. What a shame!
You didn't come home last night, did you? Oh, no. I stayed with some friends. We found the door open, so we came in. How did you get that cut? I bumped into a man carrying some baskets a little while ago.
There's the whole day missing. Did you... do anything this time? Not that I can recall. Where could I have got this? - I'll throw it away. - No.
Mmm, soon. Maybe tomorrow. Could you finish it tonight, while I'm resting, I mean? Well, I guess I could. Well, then you could... bring it over after a while. But I think it'd be awfully late, Netta.
Well, I guess I could. Well, then you could... bring it over after a while. But I think it'd be awfully late, Netta. It wouldn't matter how late, George. - Who is it? - It's I, George.
Well, then you could... bring it over after a while. But I think it'd be awfully late, Netta. It wouldn't matter how late, George. - Who is it? - It's I, George. I've just finished it.
But I think it'd be awfully late, Netta. It wouldn't matter how late, George. - Who is it? - It's I, George. I've just finished it. You said to bring it over.
- It's I, George. I've just finished it. You said to bring it over. May I come in and play it to you? Well, it's... it's awfully late, George.
May I come in and play it to you? Well, it's... it's awfully late, George. But you said it didn't matter how late. Well, darling, I've just been asleep. I'll just look at it.
Well, it's... it's awfully late, George. But you said it didn't matter how late. Well, darling, I've just been asleep. I'll just look at it. But I've... I've worked awfully hard to finish it.
- Good night. - Good night, Netta. Send for a cab, will you? Thank you. Blimey, but it's hot. I'm watching out for a load of gas pipe.
Don't, please. I'm sorry. There's a deep bruise on her throat. She says he threw something round her neck. It was probably a cord with a knot in it. That's what caused the bruise.
She says he threw something round her neck. It was probably a cord with a knot in it. That's what caused the bruise. It acted like a thuggee cord. Thuggee? What's that?
That's what caused the bruise. It acted like a thuggee cord. Thuggee? What's that? It's a method of very swift and silent murder. - But what could...
it's just one more song. It's always one more. They get stale so fast I never have time to do anything else. I won't do it. But I must have it, dear. - I open next week.
But why don't you do it like this? Try it once. Netta, it isn't a waltz. That's not the right tempo. Darling, it would be for my song! You can't have it.
Netta, it isn't a waltz. That's not the right tempo. Darling, it would be for my song! You can't have it. It belongs to the concerto. Oh, George.
That's not the right tempo. Darling, it would be for my song! You can't have it. It belongs to the concerto. Oh, George. It's such a little thing.
Can't you hear that? That's my song. Listen. Play it once. Waltz tempo. Go on.
Play it. When two... When two lips Breathe aflame This is our moment For gay love
Gunpowder, treason and plot. I see no reason why... - Remember the Guy, sir. - Fifth of November. - Remember the fifth. - I'd forgotten it was Guy Fawkes Day.
Netta's marrying me next week. That's not true. Netta... it's not true, is it? Why haven't you told me about it before? - I tried to, George. - My dear fellow...
Five pips this time. How did you know that she had them? It's obvious my dear Watson, since Mr. Davis was not at dinner, Mrs. Monteith had no opportunity to deliver the envelope. Yes of course, quite obvious. Where'd you find it?
All right. It's not often we have the opportunity at meeting such charming people. You go ahead I'll follow you. I'm afraid, Mr. Holmes, if you don't go with the sergeant there's no way to get back to the village tonight. Oh but Mr. Holmes, there's no need for you to stay at the inn. It's such a dreary place.
Aye. You'll find him like the others, a corpse. Don't you worry gentlemen it's only just a question of time before we catch Captain Simpson. He couldn't have got far. My men will soon apprehend him. You know this rather reminds me of a very similar account when I brought about the undoing of the notorious Professor Moriarty.
NARRATOR: Vigilant, tireless, implacable. The most silent service of the United States in peace or war is the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Bureau went to war with Germany long before hostilities began. No word or picture could then make public the crucial war service of the FBI.
In the FBI Identification Division are nearly 100 million sets of fingerprints so organized that it takes less than five minutes to identify a set of fingerprints with those on file. No fingerprints were listed under the name of Francisco Ruiez. But regardless of name, once his print was classified a search for the individual's identity was a simple matter. TECHNICIAN: There's something coming now. Yeah, it's in cipher. This stuff is fugitive.
You're to have these papers back here tomorrow night. Tomorrow night? That's a tough order. I've got to put this in code. It'll take time. Orders are not to be questioned.
All right. Now let's get back to this envelope. Where did you take it? I was told to take it to a house on 92nd Street. -And who told you to take it there? -I don't know.
We've been through the Vadja apartment. -Find anything? -We found the typewriter and checks. That's the one that was used to copy the data. Then Roper is the man who's been getting it out. -Shall we pick him up?
NARRATOR: For some time, Lange's Bookshop on busy 59th Street was under constant surveillance. Every person who entered or left the store was being photographed by FBI agents from an office directly across the street. LANGE: Can I help you? -Yes, I believe you can. LANGE: Are you looking for a particular book? Yes, but I can't find it.
-At his radio station. Now, you and Conrad take this out there. Stay there while he puts it into code. Make sure that he sends it... ... becauseeverything depends on you getting that through. -He'll send it.
- If it's not too unflattering. Now, you know perfectly well that nothing I could say about you-- The way you look, I mean, could be anything but flattering. - Of course, if you don't like flattery-- - But I do. On second thought, it won't be flattery.
I'm hungry right now. You must be. You haven't had dinner, have you? - Nor lunch. - You poor thing, you must be famished. Mrs. Robie told Emily to leave you a tray. Good.
This is the tastiest sandwich I've ever eaten. - What is it? - Turkey. Wild turkey. - Ever hunted them? - No, I haven't. It's tricky shooting. They're sort of scary, but they're so big and clumsy, they hate to take wing.
Say, you women think of everything, don't you? - All right, you can rest. - Oh. Ellen, you shouldn't have walked up those stairs. You know what the doctor told you. Come here and sit down. What have you done with Father's lab?
Look at me. I hate the little beast. I wish it would die! Ellen! Shocked, aren't you? If you were having the baby, you'd love it.
- What happened? - She must have tripped. Hello, Dr. Saunders? This is Ruth Berent. Please come over at once. Something terrible has happened. Well, we couldn't save the child.
With you it's simple. The alarm clock goes off, you open your eyes... brush your teeth and read the Daily Mirror. You ever lie in your bed, looking at the window? A little daylight's coming through, and you start to wonder. Is it getting lighter? Is it getting darker?
You ever lie in your bed, looking at the window? A little daylight's coming through, and you start to wonder. Is it getting lighter? Is it getting darker? Is it dawn or is it dusk? That's a terrifying problem.
- It certainly isn't. - That's what is says... 417. - I don't care what it says. - The checks must've gotten mixed up. - Maybe they did. Find my coat.
This time, I've got it. I'm gonna write! Good luck to you. You had another bottle. You know you did. Where did you put it? You're not crazy. Where did you put it?
Back then, we really had a turnover. Standing room only. Prohibition: That's what started most of these guys off. Now, be a good boy and drink this. - I don't want it.
Like to make a little bet? After all, you're just a freshman. Wait till you're a sophomore. That's when you start seeing animals. You know that stuff about pink elephants? That's bunk.
I have, Don. I assure you. It's finished. It's dead. For three years, they couldn't talk me out of you. I was the only one that really understood you. I knew there was a core of something. Well, there is.
- Who wants to be dead? - Stop lying to me. Give it to me! All right. Now, go. No fuss, please. And don't call the neighbors.
- What was that to be? - About a messed-up life. About a man and a woman and a bottle. About nightmares, horrors, humiliations... all the things I want to forget. Put it all down on paper. Get rid of it that way. Tell it all: "To whom it may concern."
I prefer to sit down before my meals. Relax and have a glass of sherry. Like Ferdinand the Bull. I am on a holiday. How does that little tune go? Let me see, I'll think of it in a minute. Incorrigible.
- Oh, isn't it a little early? - No. Hadn't we ought to wait till after dinner? Well, why not start now? All right, now, well, let's see. Did any of you ever hear of the Giant Rat of Sumatra? No, but it sounds terribly gruesome.
Yes, Gershwin. Oh, so he don't like any of our numbers. No, but I played him a song, and he likes it. It's my own. Oh, so he likes something you wrote? Listen, Pinkers, you're being paid To play Remick numbers, not your own. Do you mind? No, we don't want to publish it!
No, I'm just a song-plugger here at Remick's. Pick out something you like, and I'll play it for you. Oh, here's one I know. This one. What, again? Do you know it?
Da da da da, da da da da Oh. Da da da da, da da da da, doo Yeah, it has bounce- A diminished ninth, too. Little unusual for popular music, isn't it? Oh, I guess it is, Mr. Dreyfus,
You don't go for that stuff, do you, Paul? You're still in your right mind? I don't know. I may be kind of batty, but this looks mighty good to me. Why, it's as blue as blue Monday. Hey, that's a good title. Not bad. Blue Monday Blues. Let's go down on the stage and run it through.
Concerto? Fiddlesticks. You haven't heard the news. He's writing a new show, for you, Julie. Ira is doing the lyrics. What a combination. Play Embraceable You.
How about a penthouse? A penthouse built for two. You sound like your songs, George, And you expect life to be like your music, But it isn't. You can make up songs, but you can't make up life. Please go on with your painting. All right.
I can see a boy way down in those streets who dreamed himself A long way from the ground he started on. Came up like an elevator. Now he's looking for new buttons to push. Seems to have an idea that happiness is vertical And the last stop is heaven. Quit it, will you, Max? I thought you'd finished your portrait.
Then you'll spread your wings And you'll take the sky But till that mornin' With daddy and mammy Most of the audience loved it. What did the critics say? Some of them said it wasn't opera.
And you'll take the sky But till that mornin' With daddy and mammy Most of the audience loved it. What did the critics say? Some of them said it wasn't opera. Why wasn't it opera? Just because ordinary people liked it?
With a man who pushes you around the way I wouldn't push a cat around. You leave Johnny out of this! With your looks and figure you could get any man you want. Sure, but there's only one I want. Yeah, and he's making a tramp out of you. You wouldn't know love if it hit you in the face!
What are you doing? I was... I was looking for the paper. Are you blind? No. Didn't you... didn't you like the radio?
I'll pick it out myself. Well, don't break the bank! Hello, Lazy Legs. I thought I heard the doorbell. I didn't hear anything. Say, is this all you've got?
I've got to go, I'm supposed to be back... I'll come here tomorrow at noon, Kitty. I'll be waiting for you. I'm sorry you have to go... Bye-bye, Dear. - Don't forget the money!
- If I weren't a gentleman... - Well don't get sore! Well then don't tell me I'm crazy! I tell you the old boy's a phony. His money isn't phony, is it? He could borrow dough, or have it stashed away...
His money isn't phony, is it? He could borrow dough, or have it stashed away... - Or even steal it. - Chris steal? Jeepers, Johnny, he's not the type. He wouldn't have nerve enough to steal!
Don't you think your wife's more than that? Look, I want you to get all that's coming to you, Mr. Higgins. Now what about the insurance money? The insurance? 2000 dollars... on your life. Adele collected it.
Look, I want you to get all that's coming to you, Mr. Higgins. Now what about the insurance money? The insurance? 2000 dollars... on your life. Adele collected it. It's really yours, isn't it?
Now what about the insurance money? The insurance? 2000 dollars... on your life. Adele collected it. It's really yours, isn't it? She keeps it right in her bedroom.
The insurance? 2000 dollars... on your life. Adele collected it. It's really yours, isn't it? She keeps it right in her bedroom. Now I wouldn't touch a penny of it, Mr. Higgins, but... if you took it, it would be perfectly legal.
But why don't you get it? Why, I've got to be able to say that I didn't touch it. You know Adele... What if she don't go out... and I show up... Your goose is cooked, isn't it? Yes, but...
He tried to get away in the murdered girl's car. That was my car! This is yours, too. It's got your initials on it, but it's her blood. Here's 140 dollars that was taken out of her pocketbook. That was mine.
But why wouldn't I? She didn't have any more use for it, did she? Listen you guys, I want a lawyer! I'm a citizen, I got my rights! This belongs to you too, huh? It's got your fingerprints on it.
Please don't talk that way. You'll think I came in to hear that. I know why you came in. Why? Because something has happened to us. But it doesn't happen like that, in a day. It happens in a moment sometimes.
It happens in a moment sometimes. I felt it this afternoon. It was like lightning striking. It strikes rarely. I don't understand how it happened. - What is it?
Not yet. You're trying to tell yourself something. What it is, we'll figure out later. There's a lot more to it. Go on and try to recall the details. The more cockeyed, the better for the scientific side of it.
Angel Valley. Do you remember Angel Valley? No. We can call a travel agency and check all the resort names. It wasn't Angel Valley. I remember it.
Anchors aweigh. You've got a temperature a little over 103. Chew these sulfur pills. What is this, shrapnel? Where did you get it? Cavite.
I wish I could. Are you coming back? I'm not sure. But I don't think so. Well, this is really goodbye, then. It's been awfully nice, hasn't it?
But what number, if I'm not too inquisitive? Oh, it's all right. It's 184. It's 481. Well, you try all of them. I always do. You'll find it.
- Why, what's the matter? You see this book? It's logical, it's clear, it's honest. It doesn't tell you one thing today and another thing tomorrow. It doesn't double-cross you. It's beautiful.
My dog's name is Dizzy. What are you doing in your dinner jacket? Aren't we dressing for dinner at your mother's house tonight? - I see. - You do? Well, that's fine. You overdid it again, as you say, didn't you?
Would you care to step outside with me? Don't be a dope. Go and consolidate your position. What do you mean? Say, look, I usually charge for unpleasant work like this. - Oh, I get it, I get it.
What is your name? Patrick Jamieson, ma'am. - Are you single? - Oh, yes, ma'am. Very much so. Well, that's also unfortunate. I wanted a couple. Something in the nature of superior caretakers for this place which I intend to offer for sale furnished as it is. I'm sure I could show it off to the best possible advantage, ma'am.
And in all sorts of ways. Backwards, forwards, every which way but chiefly forwards. Well, I hope that means that you've decided to stop living in the past. Yes, that's it. I got to thinking maybe you're right. It is stupid of me.
Backwards, forwards, every which way but chiefly forwards. Well, I hope that means that you've decided to stop living in the past. Yes, that's it. I got to thinking maybe you're right. It is stupid of me. It is selfish.
- This is for you. - Thank you. Jamie Jamieson. Be kind of a pretty name. Don't think I didn't think of that. How's it feel?
Jamie Jamieson. Be kind of a pretty name. Don't think I didn't think of that. How's it feel? - How's it feel? - Feels fine.

Great flyer, especially in the stratosphere. - Where? - In the funny paper. Let's try the oxygen valve. Doorbell. - Anna's gone out.
Don't you try to make me feel guilty. Kitty, I wouldn't dream of it, it looks such fun. It often is. Often? Does it really happen to you often? Well, not anymore so than is good for me.
I don't mind anything. I just hope you've brought some sleeping pills with you. Never use drugs. Hey, what's that? Oh, this is a little invention of mine. Hello, Diz.
And how does he scare them into believing that they may have committed those atrocious murders themselves? Very curious. Curious, what's curious? That window in the empty house across the street, first floor front. Oh, what's wrong with it? It's open.
Very curious. Curious, what's curious? That window in the empty house across the street, first floor front. Oh, what's wrong with it? It's open. Why shouldn't it be open?
Follow the motion of the water, so smooth, not a ripple. Waters of forgetfulness. Steady, deep, strong. Strange, isn't it, how the light is reflected. Little specks of light that move and move. It's restful here. It's peaceful.
Go out onto the terrace. But it won't look like suicide, sir. I'm sorry, but Mr. Holmes' injuries must all be self-inflicted. Let's walk a little, Mr. Holmes. It's so pleasant here in the garden. Just step up here onto the terrace.
- Instead... - When will it be over? There are times when I can't take any more. It seems like we'll never get out of this hell. It'll be over, Pina, and spring will come back, and it'll be even more beautiful because we'll be free. We have to believe in it.
No, I don't remember. Sure you do. This one here. I applied it to relieve the pain. - And it still hurts? - Not for some time. But to be sure, you always carry it.
This one here. I applied it to relieve the pain. - And it still hurts? - Not for some time. But to be sure, you always carry it. I wanted to return it to the dentist. That explains it.
thoroughly stymied... except for one vitally important lead... this face, this name, this man... is still alive. Monsieur Duclois. A very important man to the Germans. Burn that face, that picture, into your memory... because the success of your mission, and subsequently... the destruction of the target, is linked to that man. - Duclois. - Duclois. - Duclois. - Well, what is his connection with the bomb depot?
Everything here is at your command. I don't feel at ease in all this finery, and i'm not used to being waited on. But i sense you are doing everything possible to help me forget your ugliness. I have a good heart, but i am a monster. There are men far more monstrous than you, though they conceal it well. Besides being hideous, i'm not quick-witted.
If i accept, do you swear to return in a week? I swear. Come. Look over there, belle. Do you see that pavilion? It's called diana's pavilion.
For heaven's sake! An elegant woman, and father standing at her side! And us without our finery! It's belle! - Belle? Impossible.
Something quite overwhelming has happened. I'm going to be married. Oh, someone I've known for years. Someone I love very much. Alex, I implore you, don't take it like this. But I can't help it. How else could I say it?
But I haven't played it for such a long time. Tell me, are you a musician? - Cellist, yes. - Extraordinary thing, teaching a person. - Pygmalion and all that. - Yes, I was surprised to hear you did it.
I was scared out of my wits at first. You were scared too. I saw it when you came in. But I've been playing it all the afternoon. I have it. It's so wonderful. What a creation. It's something I never hoped for or dreamed of.
- Come along, my dear. We'll drop you. Alex, I think I'd rather walk. Good luck. This concludes the 1 a.m. Edition of worldwide news. The following is transcribed. Remember, folks, when you spell Drawrof backwards, it reads forward.
Karel's life has been a tragic one. He's suffered a good deal in the past few years. He's... Well, he's like a man who's coming out of the darkness into the light. And, well, Hollenius wants to put him back into the darkness. First he offers him this wonderful opportunity. - He's gonna take it away. - I can't believe it.
So it took this to make you believe me? Oh, I was a jealous fool. You don't know how many ways jealous people can torment themselves. Forgive me. Oh, it's nothing. Nothing at all. It's finished and done with.
Careful? That's funny. You're funny, Jo Jo. It's broken. He broke it. He shouldn't have done it.
Oh, I hurt inside. Simple arithmetic. Yes. One and one make two. I wanted money. Frankie Olins had it.
Yes. One and one make two. I wanted money. Frankie Olins had it. He took it from a shiny red bank truck two days before Christmas. $400,000.
The slovenly old women, the gray-faced, dirty little children, starting out with everything against them? I remember that street. - Do you love me? - Yes. But I can't forget your street. I remember every little thing about it.
Come on and help me with the box, Benny. - Who, me? - Yeah, you. Oh. No, not like that. How many times do I have to tell you?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. One, two, three, four, five. Lloyd, where are you, you fool? Lloyd, here, I found it! I found it, Lloyd! Come on!
One, two, three, four, five. Lloyd, where are you, you fool? Lloyd, here, I found it! I found it, Lloyd! Come on! Come and dig it!
Lloyd, here, I found it! I found it, Lloyd! Come on! Come and dig it! Come and dig for it! Dig!
I found it, Lloyd! Come on! Come and dig it! Come and dig for it! Dig! There it is, in the ground.

Get off it! It's mine! It's all mine now! It's mine, I found it! It's mine! Mine.
You're not serious? Oh, but I am. Well, you put me at a very awkward position. I'm a collector you know and a collector buys but never sells. But if the price were high enough. The price has nothing to do with it.
Who's covering them? Sergeant Thompson is following them, sir. They won't get away from him, he's a good man. He could have arrested them at Kibbutz's Toy Shop if we had any proof. But we know that they killed Emery. Proof, my dear fellow, we must have proof.
Here, play the song for me, will you, the way it's written. - There you are. - Thank you, Joe. What's it mean, Holmes? You on to something? Perhaps. I don't know yet.
We now have two thirds of a message. Behind books, third shelf, secretary, Doctor 'S'. Presumably, these are the first and second portions of the message. And this gang has the first and third parts of it. - Precisely.
Isn't that interesting? - What's the matter with you? - "Women and gambling don't mix." My wife isn't just a "woman". - I could've made a mistake. - You did. Don't make it again.
I am Captain Delgado. I would like permission to dance with your lady. - The answer is no. - The answer is yes. I'd love it. - But the young man...
Johnny will take you to the party. What's the matter? You're very excited about something. Perhaps it's in the air. Perhaps you shouldn't have opened the window. Close it.
The plane leaves at two o'clock. At two the next day you'll be free! I didn't think I'd ever trust another man, but here I go again. Thanks, Tom. - Tom, this is the Hotel Centenario. - I was told it's a good hotel.
Say, brainless, don't you know where coconuts come from? Lookit here. From Tahiti, the Fiji islands, the Coral Sea. A new magazine. I never saw it before. Of course you never.

Gee whiz, I could use that as a raft in case the boat sunk. - How much this cost? - No charge. That's my trick ear, Joe. It sounded like you said "no charge." That's right. Well, what's my name doing on it? A little present from old man Gower.
Oh, look at this. Old Bert. Champagne! By the way, where are you two going on this here now honeymoon? Where are we going? Look at this. There's the kitty, Ernie.
Just make yourselves at home. George, can I see you a minute? - Why didn't you call me? - I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George. This is a pickle. All right, now, what happened?
Well, you're gonna miss this one. If you close your doors before 6:00 p.m., you will never reopen. George, was it a nice wedding? Gosh, I wanted to be there. Yeah. You can take this one off now.
I can't think anymore, George. I can't think anymore. It hurts. Where's that money, you silly, stupid old fool? Where's that money? Do you realize what this means?
How do you like it? - Bless you! - Bless you! Did you bring the wreath? Yes, Daddy, did you bring the Christmas wreath? What wreath? The Merry Christmas wreath for the window. No. I left it at the office.
- Just one. - Can I see it? - This way. Upstairs. Just got in town. Fella runs the lunchroom down the street said you had a roomer here. Name of Lunn, somethin' like that. Said he died. Thought the room might still be empty. It still is empty.
Funny climate around here. The harder the wind blows, the hotter it gets. We call that wind the Santa Ana. It comes from the desert. Nick, why don't you let me take your car, I'll run that sign into town and get it fixed. Okay.
- That's all right, Nick, I'll pick them up. - Oh. What's the difference if they do get dirty? I got them washed for free. [SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] Right then, I should have walked out of that place but I couldn't make myself do it.
- Didn't you? - I was only joking. - Were you? - Yes, I was. - Or had you started to think about it? - I didn't really mean it.
I'm telling you, don't sell it! Well, I'm... I'm going to sell it. I'm superstitious. I... Never turn down a good offer.
Can you go through with it? - After that, I can go through anything. - All right, let's get down there. We gotta mess ourselves up to prove we've been in the accident too. - Right. - Come on.
- After that, I can go through anything. - All right, let's get down there. We gotta mess ourselves up to prove we've been in the accident too. - Right. - Come on. It's hardly smashed up at all.
Oh, I tried. I tried, but nobody could have stopped you. However, now that you've got it off your chest... - Kennedy. MAN: Yes, sir? That confession Mrs. Smith signed, what did you do with it?
I've got to tell you all about it. We... We took a life, didn't we, Frank? Well, now we can give one back. Then maybe God will forgive us and maybe it'll help square us. Maybe it will.
You can't live without money. I have a little. That's what gives me the chance to do what I want. You're making it very difficult for me. I'm sorry, darling. I wouldn't if I could help it.
- No, I just thought it'd do me good to work up a sweat. What have the other Poles told you about me? Not much. They advised me not to play cards with you because you cheat. - Do you think it's true? - Yes.
What did you say it was like, Uncle Elliott? Like listening to music by moonlight. It is. Sophie. - Yes? - I saw the most divine wedding dress at Molyneux's.
It must be awful just to break off completely, all at once. Sometimes when I've been alone I've wanted to shake the house down. But I've quit. - Yesterday at the Ritz was tough going. - I know, I saw it. Did you?
But I've quit. - Yesterday at the Ritz was tough going. - I know, I saw it. Did you? Did I show it? Only to me, I think.
Faded the sight of beauty From my eyes Faded the shape of beauty From my arms Faded the voice, warmth Whiteness, paradise Vanished unseasonably at shut of eve My advice is that you go and have a good dinner. I have a card here of one of the best restaurants in Toulon.
You look extremely well. Well, really now, young Mr. Larry Darrell that's the most sensible thing I've ever heard you say. Of course he's right. It's only a temporary indisposition. I'm lunching with a duke on Sunday and I've told my doctor he must put me to rights by then at all costs. It's too bad this should have happened just now.
But no, I threw you out! I thought I was being so noble, remember? Look at me, Larry. You know you love me. You know that you've always wanted me. Say it's true.
- What's around the corner? - Café. Called the Cellar. Because it's in a cellar. Lots of guys get loaded there and then come over here to sweat it out. - Maybe you oughta ask there about your pal. - What time's it open? How do I know?
- Tom? I never touch it. It keeps me awake. You better have some. You're going to be pretty sleepy this afternoon. That was some drop- two million bucks. How's a thing like that happen? Well, it's a long story. Don't ask for details, but here's most of it.
Well, it's a long story. Don't ask for details, but here's most of it. It started over in Germany when one of the Nazi hotshots saw the handwriting on the wall. He sent the two million over here. And then before he could come over after it... he got knocked off by one of the fellow members of the lodge. And here was this big chunk of dough floating'around loose in this country... like a pair of dice at a firemen's ball. It moved east to west.

And here was this big chunk of dough floating'around loose in this country... like a pair of dice at a firemen's ball. It moved east to west. Each time it moved, it left a stiff behind it with his fingers stretched out. The boys play rough for that kind of lettuce, you understand.
Stop talking like Bela Lugosi. How did you know where to find me? I didn't know I was going to find you. I got a note that said Larry Cravat was at 42111/2 Summit. - I don't get it. - From whom was the note?
Kendall doesn't work out of the missing persons bureau, you know. - He's homicide. - He steals fried shrimps. He wants to help, and so do I. You asked me to, remember? What kind of trouble is Taylor in? It won't make any difference to me. Maybe it will.
It came out of nowhere. My head- My head hurts. Are you Conroy? Michael Conroy. My daughter, she'll worry. Will someone- Her name is Elizabeth.
Still, you can't tell. The war's very young yet. Sure. Sure. It's only 1942, isn't it? My back - Now my back's beginning to hurt. Conroy, the other night, a couple of nights ago, maybe... a man was murdered on the dock. - You saw it. - Yes. I saw it.

Remember, I had my face pushed around at Okinawa. The docs patched me up. - Well, Phyllis? - I don't know. It - It could be. I don't know for sure. After all, I only met him once. I'm Larry Cravat. You can take my word for it. - I do.
- Back in the car. - But the money's inside. - Do as you're told! - What about Christy? - She goes too. - You won't get the money! Yes, I will.
- But the money's inside. - Do as you're told! - What about Christy? - She goes too. - You won't get the money! Yes, I will. I know where it is now.
Move along. Afternoon, Mr Wilson. Afternoon, Noah. Bring them right in there, Mr Peabody. What does the law say about this kind of murder? is it the same as killing a man?
Naturally we'll try to prevent murder being done. But the proof that murder is his aim would be the strongest evidence she could have. {clock strikes} Charles. Listen. it's striking. After 100 years.
He might be anywhere, the murderer. Waiting for a new victim. I hope you haven't forgotten you were kind enough to invite me. - No, of course not. - Mr Potter asked me to deliver this. - Good. Sara's waiting for it.
What makes you so sure it's murder, Mr. Holmes, the door was locked? Every attendant has a key. Did you open this door for anyone during the last hour? No sir. Was the key ever out of your possession? It never is, sir.
You just told me that this fellow Holmes is a crony of yours, naturally he'd lie. I resent that sir. Sherlock Holmes is very full of integrity. Might even be an accomplice. Oh well if I were a policeman I'd take you and charge this very moment. I didn't do it sir.
Stay here. There may be coppers watching the place. Inspector, I guess where I'm going, I won't need these. He's got Johnny. You are lucky. You get the cell with the gramophone. It belonged to barry, Him who chopped off his uncle's head. Oh.
He left it here for anyone to use Who might occupy this cell. That was 5 hangings ago. 5 ago. It's broke, the record, in the middle. It won't go any further. It keeps playing the same thing over and over again. Please don't do that. You know, it gets on the prisoners' nerves. I imagine it would. It's very simple. I'll show you.
Well, why don't you sit down and rest? How can I rest? I must have that ticket. A man is waiting on the corner with a check only a block away. I must have it! Make her give it to me, Mr. West. Make her give it to me now! Or it will be too late!
Let me take off my bags. - You take them off? - Of course. I'll get your money. It's a 500? Yes, I just sold it.
- You take them off? - Of course. I'll get your money. It's a 500? Yes, I just sold it. It's a great machine.
- 900. 900? It's expensive. I need another book, I finished mine. The Ace of Clubs. Is this one any good? I don't know. Take it.
I need another book, I finished mine. The Ace of Clubs. Is this one any good? I don't know. Take it. It helps me pass the time. I don't want to take it out now.
No kidding! Mr Dupuis, did you find a wallet? A wallet? You believe in Santa Claus? Do you know the number? 139 800. Block it. Say you lost it. Then no one else can use it.
And 12 years from now, it'll still be next Tuesday. Look, Gallagher, I know this drum's full of crackpots. One con's gonna buy his way out. Another knows the governor's cousin. A third guy's even gonna float out in a homemade balloon. But I'm not buying any pipe dreams. It can be done. It's been done before, and it'll be done again.
Honey, make a wish. What are you talking about? Tom! Oh, Tom, darling. Here, put it on. It's beautiful.
Give me some more light. We sent some men out in a boat. They landed up here. We covered 'em with a heavy bombardment. At "H" hour, we attacked uphill. The Krauts turned all their guns to stop us. That was exactly when the other gang attacked from behind.
Get the gun and come on. Come on, Collins. Come on. What's the plan now? The plan's a flop. You're on your own. It's a million-to-one. He's trying to ram the gates!
Came home and landed at Sanlúcar just two days ago. - That's not Malaga. - No, señor. Tell me about the Indies, señor. That word sets your imagination on fire, doesn't it? Well, why not?
- Does it happen that you're riding into Jaén? - Yes. Well, then, by your leave, I'll ride with you. - Girl. Have the boy bring my animal too. - Sí, señor. And, uh, here. - This'll fetch you a new dress. But it's gold.
You took me by surprise, señor. I hadn't seen you. - Take the ring back. - Oh, no, no. - Take it back! - No. Keep it till tomorrow.
Bless my soul. And I had a door built. - Where's the lock to this chest? - Right here. That's odd. This has been filed. The Indians have no steel.
Well, why not? In the practice of true science, God often lends a hand. You may think that anyone can lay a hot iron on an open wound. Far from it. It has to be timed to the very split of a second. Had I removed the iron too soon, the wound would not have seared.
But, sir, those ships are our only means of communication and— and retreat. If one can't retreat, he must go forward. If we survive this expedition, gentlemen... the order I have given to destroy this armada... will go down in history as a monument to our resolution and courage. If we fail, it doesn't matter, as history will forget us. Sir, this is not an attack. It's a peaceful mission.

If we fail, it doesn't matter, as history will forget us. Sir, this is not an attack. It's a peaceful mission. - How do you know, de Vargas? Maybe it's a trick.
You ought to be on your way someplace. Sure, you can stay, but you shouldn't. I need a week. - The cops may be on their way right now! - I can't travel with this face. It's plastered all over the papers.
It needs to be changed. I'm going there tonight. Plastic surgery? - That costs money. - I've got plenty. A girl named Irene Jansen gave it to me.
I perfected my own special technique 12 years ago... before I was kicked out of the Medical Association. My method is based partly on calling a spade a spade. I don't monkey around. - Have you got the money? - Yeah, you want it now? Sam said you could afford $200.
That's why human beings live so long. You won't feel any pain with this. I'll give you some shots that'll freeze your face. Now, just close your eyes. I've got a fine anesthetic. Used it in the last war.
Now he won't bother me, and he won't let her bother me. Now you'll be safe. It's time, Vincent. It's time for the bandages to come off. I know it's awfully early... but you said you wanted to get away before it got light. How does your face feel?
It's unbelievable. But it's good. I think I even like you better. Don't let it give you any ideas. - What kind? - Don't change yours.
I didn't see any car. - Tell me or I'll shoot it out of you. - I didn't see any car! If you want to walk away from here, tell me if it's the same car I think it was. I haven't got a thing to lose. Not a thing.
It was the one big thing in your mind when you killed him. You told yourself you were rid of me and nobody else could have me. It's all written down here. That's no evidence. That's just the way you figure it. That's why you're after a confession, isn't it?
I was in four battles. Gee. I liked that. You mean you... You really liked them? Sure. You forget everything. I was up for the Navy cross.
What I mean is, they look like they've been pierced for earrings. Do they really? By Jove, they probably do. Well, well. - I was wondering if you'd mind talking about it. - Not at all. Not at all.
It was that evil, misbegotten son of a goat, that Zoltan. May he rot and swell and split himself inside out. With coals of fire in his belly may he die slowly. Better you put that coat on, liebling. Coat? Thank you, I'm not cold.
Before I ever saw you, when the water spirits told me you were coming... I say to myself, "This will be my man." Liebling, you are my man. Mine. - Nothing can change that. - Never mind that nonsense. How did you find out about me and the escape and the rest of it?
Today in Germany, everybody is watched, even the watchers. Come. Tonight would you be entertaining the chief of police... these Nazi party officials and elite guard officers... if you weren't forced to? - They suspect, Otto. - Let them. And if they searched me, would they ever suspect this, uh... piece of money? - Let me keep it.
I can say goodbye to a lot, and quickly. You know that. But I won't say goodbye to myself, just because I love someone who demands it as a matter of course. One imagines things differently to how they are, and forgets coincidence. Here we stand under your beautiful old plane-tree by this small avenue which branches off from my street and leads only to you. It's early morning, it's cold, and we're reaching a decision. And it all seems as if it were meant to be so.
Did he ask you if you wanted to go with him? Yes. - And what did you say? This morning I said no. Then perhaps it was a happy day, if a bit different. No! Don't scratch it out.
- Your memory, girl! - There you are! You see, Angela, a concert tour is as much work as Papa's job in the museum, isn't it? It's not a pleasure trip. Quite the contrary. And this time it'll be a hard-fought battle.
Why should I? My white letters are enough. "Bienert Frames" is our name. That's all people need to know. Don't act dumb. Everyone knows it's been signed over to me.
No. I don't know what's up. A problem with the engine? - No. No water. - Is that dangerous?
That'll be the station. Oh yes, of course. Perhaps I can get a train here to Well? I can't keep it in my head. Illingenworth!
Oh yes, of course. Perhaps I can get a train here to Well? I can't keep it in my head. Illingenworth! May I write it down?
Considerable! I interviewed him for my paper, The Real France. Have you heard of it? I published it in November 1940. Yes. 1940... That took some courage back then, to risk yourself in such an adventure.
Emptying my safe deposit box. Burglars might break in. What nonsense. Good thing we haven't any servants. It's perfectly safe tonight. Should have been left where it was.
You have a job. Yes, I have a job. If I lose one, I can always find another. Peter, don't pull the cat's tail. You have a cruel streak. Where do you get it? I'm only playing with him.
Oh, this is too much. Silly, carrying on this way. I was beginning to lose faith. Then this happens and you want to believe all over again. This is a ruthless world and one must be ruthless to cope with it. That isn't true.
- Pretty? It's for the woman next door. I'm worried about the deed to this house. I want it back in my name. - Why, of course. - We can go to the lawyer's now. - Today?
We'll have to give him that. All right, sir go ahead. Just remember, I've got a 3 o'clock train to meet. Thank you, I'll be brief. Colonel brewton, How much cattle range do you control? I've heard it runs into a million or more acres. I've never counted them.
And I suppose it's hard to understand That all that out there is anything but just a lot of grass Made to order for farming. Yes, I suppose it is just grass to most. But not to you, jim? To me, it's land the way god made it And wants it to stay. And I may be wrong but I've got a hunch That he wants me to help him keep it that way.
Made to order for farming. Yes, I suppose it is just grass to most. But not to you, jim? To me, it's land the way god made it And wants it to stay. And I may be wrong but I've got a hunch That he wants me to help him keep it that way. I know it's too soon to expect you to see it that way, lutie
But not to you, jim? To me, it's land the way god made it And wants it to stay. And I may be wrong but I've got a hunch That he wants me to help him keep it that way. I know it's too soon to expect you to see it that way, lutie But you will see it some day.
When you first drove up today, I thought "Here comes lady bountiful." I take it back. You're really fond of sam and selina hall. Selina was my first friend out here. I'm awfully glad she doesn't seem lonely. Did you expect her to be? Well, this is the place for it. Hardly a woman'country. It could be.
My fault, lutie not yours. Jim, if you won't help the halls For themselves, then do it for me. I love selina, and right now, she hates me. There's nothing I can do, lutie. This would only happen again, or something similar. It figured to happen. This tough country, lutie. This country, I'm sick to death Of talking about this country. You really think it's more important
It's hard to say but... The halls don't count for much, lutie. Neither do we. But that out there does... And men like chamberlain, they want to farm it. They want to dig it up and draw the water out of its veins, Let the sun get at it, way down deep. It would curl up and die then, lutie, It would be dead, and so would the whole country, It would never live again.
- It was in the right leg. Mr. Charles, I think you have this all wrong. - Have you read the morning paper? - No. I haven't gotten to it yet. But, I do know that...
By special arrangement with Mr. Brant himself. A quaint old maneuver to divert suspicion. As they say in the movies, "They went thataway." You're right. It's an oldie. A very old oldie.
Lay off there a ways till I call you. Callahan, that ain't an anchor out of the water. It's a dinghy. How did that dinghy get there? Not very neat of the inspector, was it? What's the excitement, boy?
It's a dinghy. How did that dinghy get there? Not very neat of the inspector, was it? What's the excitement, boy? It's just a razorblade. Oh, no.
No, I was just looking for my instrument. - Is it one of them big bass tuba things? - Yeah, that's it. There it is. Thanks. If it was any bigger, it'd bite you.
Mrs. Talbin. How do you do? We met before. At the Charity Ball? Remember, when you dropped your necklace? Yes.
We met before. At the Charity Ball? Remember, when you dropped your necklace? Yes. Why aren't you wearing it? You're wearing the earrings.
Bop. Love it. Come on. Live a little, Ziggy. Live a little, man. My body needs lifting.
- Yeah. I'm sorry, I don't feel it yet. That ain't it yet. I don't feel it. That's it. Yeah.
- Well... - I have half of Poughkeepsie on my face. I like that corner particularly. We'll join you as soon as we finish. - Who gets the bone? - I do.
Why, that's the same... Of course, I remember the lace perfectly. - Where did you get this? - Eve's Fifth Avenue, I think. - I mean, is it yours? - I only steal cocktail napkins.
What is it? Mrs. Amboy's necklace. She isn't wearing it anymore. - I don't like it. - Sorry, but that's the way it's got to be. - She isn't.
Mrs. Amboy's necklace. She isn't wearing it anymore. - I don't like it. - Sorry, but that's the way it's got to be. - She isn't. - And Mrs. Talbin is wearing it.
Mr. Bannister tells me you once killed a man. -You are Michael, aren't you? -That's right. I'm very interested in murders. Forgive me if I seem inquisitive, but where'd it happen? -At Murcia.
-That's right. I'm very interested in murders. Forgive me if I seem inquisitive, but where'd it happen? -At Murcia. -How'd you do it? Now, let me guess.
I'm very interested in murders. Forgive me if I seem inquisitive, but where'd it happen? -At Murcia. -How'd you do it? Now, let me guess. You did it with your hands, didn't you?
Does it ever bother you when you think about it? What'd he do to you? Nothing. You just killed him for the fun of it? He was a Franco spy. There was a war on at the time.
-Are you independently wealthy? -I'm independent. Of money? Before you write that novel, you'd better learn something. You've been travelling the world too much to find out about it. That's good, Arthur.
-I did. -Did he say anything about us? -He's afraid the world's going to explode. He talked about suicide. I've thought of that sometimes. Suicide?
We're in one of them now. Running away doesn't work. I tried it. Everything's bad, Michael. Everything. You can't escape it or fight it.
You don't understand, darling. He isn't dead yet, Grisby's alive. He won't be murdered until tonight. Is that foolish enough for you? My husband wrote that thing and got you to sign it for him. It's one of those famous Bannister tricks.
I was the murdered man's partner. The other victim was my servant. If I defend Michael, any jury will figure I have reason to believe he's innocent. And you have reason to believe that Michael is innocent? I hear that Galloway is going to say that Michael took George's corpse into the city in our speedboat. -We can prove he didn't.

I hear that Galloway is going to say that Michael took George's corpse into the city in our speedboat. -We can prove he didn't. -George couldn't have taken it. -Why not?
-George couldn't have taken it. -Why not? -How could it get back? -Back where? -To the yacht, naturally. The speedboat couldn't have driven itself.
However, they do a lot of talking in your groups. You just talk, talk and hear a lot. Well, sir, it so happens that I've kept silent for ten years. It's been ten years since I've made a vow to remain silent and not to show my face to anybody. Tonight I'm showing my face and I'm talking, this is superb! Tell me about your adventure. Take this.
It's you who's shouting for all the palace to hear you! Don't you see that I'm going crazy! Shoot! - Don't tempt me! - In a few seconds it'll be too late... Alright, kill me!
An extraordinary resemblance! What does the Queen think about it? I think this resemblance has acted more in my favour with Her Majesty that my personal merits. You seem tired. Sit down. Next to me. This resemblance might be useful to us. If we disapproved of it, it might create a scandal.
Happiness is ugly, Stanislaus, if it's not paired without misfortune. But when happiness and misfortune are just as terrible, that's magnificent. - My love... - Look at my neck. This morning my medallion seemed to strangle me. Death who imprisons me, shouted to me "So you want to live, girl?
Thank the stars I'm with you again. Katya, you have a Russian soul! Why did you have to be born in that Boston? Nature went mad that day, Boris. You have not been around since you sent me this Joan Madou. Why? What is the matter with her?
And if you returned, you know you would always go again. Yes. Yes, yes, yes! Oh, what's the use? What is it? Why is it that way with us?
Without you, I wouldn't be alive anyway. You gave me this year. Why didn't I stay with you? It was my fault, Joan. No. It was...
[Continues] What is it? Music here in my own forest? How dare they? How dare they? I don't know, Your Majesty. I want my stag! It must be a band marching down the highway.
You've seen poodle puppies, haven't you, Holenia? Charming little beasts. Look as if they were made of black wool and licorice. If I might be excused, Your Majesty. What is it? What's happening? She's run away.
I sincerely hope so. And now let us proceed to a luncheon we have prepared for you. A very simple luncheon. Powdered egg omelette, probably, and a little Spam. - Can I carry that for you? - No, thank you.
I thought you'd be interested in a typical Berlin residential area. If you look hard, you'll see the houses are empty shells, completely burned out by incendiaries. Life goes on in those ruins, though. That used to be the largest department store in Berlin. It was 12 storeys high. Later on it became headquarters for the storm troopers.
But there is a new will to live. We had to build schools and find teachers and then teach the teachers. We helped them start a free press and institute a parliamentary government. They had their first free election in 14 years. It had been so long they didn't know what to do. It was like handing the village drunk a glass of water.
It's no fun to walk around with a target pinned on your chest. I'd appreciate it if you'd leave me alone. How's about some reading matter for the plane? Those aren't teardrops. I was washing my hands when he asked me to give it to you. All right, I'll put it right there.
I don't know. I've tasted most everything. Sergeant, you a judge of whiskey? Well, sir, some people say I am, and some say I'm not, sir. Tell me what you make of this. Well it's better than no whiskey at all, sir. - Strike a match.
I tell you, this is not a proper or suitable marriage for you. I can't believe that. Sergeant Major O'Rourke, you will pardon me for speaking bluntly. But as a noncommissioned officer, you are aware of the barrier between your class and mine. - I am, sir. But Michael's an officer. Not that it makes any difference.
Do not forever with thy lowered lids seek for thy noble father in the dust. Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die, passing through nature to eternity. Aye, madam, it is common. If it be, why seems it so particular with thee? Seems, madam?
These hands are not more like. - But where was this? - Upon the platform, where we watched. - Did you not speak to it? - My lord, I did, but answer made it none. Yet once methought it lifted up its head as it would speak.
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger. - And fixed his eyes upon you? - Most constantly. - I would I had been there. - It would have much amazed you. Very like. Very like.
- Why he more than another? Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, it will keep out water a great while. Here. Here's a skull now. This skull hath lain in the earth three and twenty year. - Whose was it? - A whoreson mad fellow's it was.
Some woman! Couldn't you spend it better? Better? I'm grateful. Because she's the one that got me the job? Let's go. Hurry up, Bruno. It's almost 6:30. I can't clean it good because it's still dark. Daddy, did you see what they've done?
I'm grateful. Because she's the one that got me the job? Let's go. Hurry up, Bruno. It's almost 6:30. I can't clean it good because it's still dark. Daddy, did you see what they've done? It's dented.
Alfredo! What is it? Lay off! Yesterday I was at the fruit market. Excuse me. This man here stole your bicycle? Yes, and I want it back.
- And hurry up. You'll be late for breakfast. - Yeah. - Who did it? Yes? - I did. Haven't I repeatedly told you not to cut up the paper until I've read it? I'm sorry, Father.
Well, folks. There she is. It's charming. That is, for an old house. You understand, Mr. Smith, we're just window-shopping. Oh, perfectly all right. Not a bad-looking house.
That still doesn't make it a good buy. Bill. Muriel and I have found what I'm not ashamed to call our dream house. It's like a painting. You buy it with your heart, not your head. You don't ask, "How much was the paint? The canvas?" You look at it.
Bill. Muriel and I have found what I'm not ashamed to call our dream house. It's like a painting. You buy it with your heart, not your head. You don't ask, "How much was the paint? The canvas?" You look at it. And you say, "It's beautiful. I want it."
Where would you go for a drink of water? Well, I must admit, it's a very beautiful thing. The house and the lilac bush at the corner are just the same age, Bill. If a lilac can live and be so old, so can the house. It just needs someone to love it, that's all. It's good there are two of you.
One to love it, one to hold it up. What'd your engineer say about the foundation and the roof? Who needs engineers? This isn't a train. I just saw it move. It's stood since the second year of the Continental Congress.
No, thanks. I think you'd better get in touch with Mr. Apollonio. The house has charm, hasn't it, Mr. Apollonio? Any small changes would have to conform to the character of the countryside. And still be functional. What is your professional opinion?
- Sorry, we couldn't possibly. A simple bathroom, 8 by 10 by 8 with grade-A fixtures will cost around $ 1300. I refuse to endanger my children's health in a house with less than four bathrooms. For $ 1300, they can live in a house with three bathrooms and rough it. - Why, Bill! - Hello, Muriel.
He's digging our well. - How long does that go on? - Three weeks now at $4.50 a foot. - Yeah, right. I think I'd better have a little talk with Mr. Tesander. - Yep? - How's it coming?
- Just the same... - And I consider it very tasty. Gussie, I spend eight hours every day trying to cram this stuff down the throats of millions. I know all about it. Its succulent goodness. - Its sugar-smoked tenderness.
Is that clear? Now, the kitchen's to be white. - Not a cold, antiseptic, hospital white. - No. A little warmer, but still, not to suggest any other color but white. Now, for the powder room in here, I want you to match this thread. And don't lose it.
Now, the kitchen's to be white. - Not a cold, antiseptic, hospital white. - No. A little warmer, but still, not to suggest any other color but white. Now, for the powder room in here, I want you to match this thread. And don't lose it. It's the only spool I have and I had an awful time finding it.
It's a conspiracy, I tell you, against every boy and girl who were ever in love! What do you want? Mr. Blandings, there's a matter of $ 12.36. Twelve dollars and thirty-six cents. Why be a piker, Mr. Tesander? Here, take everything I've got.
Where is it? Is it wound? Is it oiled? Is it true? - You're not gonna use it? - Certainly. Take it on, Gumbo.
Is it wound? Is it oiled? Is it true? - You're not gonna use it? - Certainly. Take it on, Gumbo. Oh, it's like a graveyard out there.
Your Excellency, you don't know this man. He's diabolically clever. He's trying to trick you, make a fool of you. Excellency, I await your permission. No. No.
- Why not? - She's mine. I see a "D" for Dunson, but my name's Matthew. - We'll talk about that later. - I don't see any "M" on that brand. I'll put an "M" on it when you earn it. That's fair enough.
Amigo, it is my work. Pretty unhealthy job. Get away, Matt. I'm sorry for you-- How about you? You want some of it?
We didn't get along very well, and I want to find out why. See, he thought I was one of a bunch-- Hold it. Right there. It's all right, Buster. It's me, Matt.
Hey, hold it a minute. What was that? - Did you hear something? - I didn't hear nothing. I heard it. It was nothing I ever heard before. Hey, they're yelling down on the point.
We can't have everything, can we? We did do it in daytime. Alright now, Phillip? - Yes. - Good. You better put those away in my chequebook drawer behind the box. Now...
- Yes. - Good. You better put those away in my chequebook drawer behind the box. Now... It's a museum piece now. We really should preserve it for posterity, except, it's such good crystal and I'd hate to break up the set. Out of this, David Kentley had his last drink.
- What are you doing? - It's not locked. All the better. It's more dangerous. And the lock's too old. It won't work. I wish it would. I wish we had him out of here. I wish it were somebody else.
- Notice what? - The rope, of course. Brandon, we've got to hide it. - Why? - Why? Yes, why?
Then maybe Mrs Wilson forgot something. Answer it. Brandon... Brandon, couldn't we pretend we're not home? With all these lights on? Answer it, Phillip. Who is it?
- I can draw you a picture. - Save it for Chickamaw. Mattie got us a house in Gusherton all right. Had to take it for six months. - Gonna leave the car here? - Sure, it's okay. Some shack, eh?
- No. You ain't aiming to get a hitch? That's no way to start a honeymoon. You got any ideas? Well, thought maybe I could fix you up with a car. Maybe. Party I know took in a new convertible today. How long will it take?
Well, here we are. Uh, mind the second step. Not fancy, but it's comfortable. We got a lot of blankets. It gets kind of chilly up here. It freezes, but it never snows.
Chickamaw was always talking about them cities. He said people don't big-eye you so much. I guess Alvin won't get his sweater for Christmas. I left it on the radio. He'll find it. Bowie... I'm gonna have our baby.
To arrive in Paris on one day and be killed on the next. Oh, there's no hurry. My seconds haven't arrived yet. With all respect, sir, would it be proper if we didn't wait? You see, I have a similar appointment in an hour. That is, if I survive this one. No, just as you say.
- Give me that ring. - What is it? What's the matter, Athos? I don't understand you. That's a very beautiful ring. Yes.
Richelieu. " This will be quite satisfactory. - Listen. - The rest is bargaining. My terms are simple. First, there is a certain estate in the vicinity of Lille, a barony. It was renounced by its owner quite some years ago.
I can neither kill you nor take you away. Your kidnappers, in a few minutes would report to Richelieu either your corpse or your disappearance. And, you, my dear wife fainting is neither becoming nor believable. Richelieu gave you a certain paper, a carte blanche. Since I cannot kill you, I must at least have that paper. No.
- Come on. - Hello, there. - Hello, yourself. Okay, you guys, get aboard. Take it your way. What's the matter with you two?
I think I'll go to sleep... and dream about piles of gold... getting bigger and bigger. Do you believe what the old man... who was doing all the talking at the Oso Negro... said the other night... about gold changing a man's soul so that he ain't the same kind of a guy... that he was before finding it? Guess that all depends on the man. That's exactly what I say. Gold don't carry any curse with it. It all depends on whether or not the guy who finds it is the right guy.
Look, Curt, there's a vein of it, here, in this rock. Look here. Look, it's all around. What else could it be? Only gold shines and glitters like that. We've struck it, Curt.
Sure don't look like I thought it would. - Not much different from sand. - Yeah. It's just like plain sand. It don't glitter. I thought it would. It will when it's refined by some other guy.
Pretty soon I won't be able to tell you a thing. - Tank full yet? - Right to the top. Open the sluice gate. How much do you figure it to be now? About $5,000 worth, I reckon.
Forget about that for now. There's something more important. What is it? Brace yourself. I'm gonna kick you in the teeth. You won't like it right at first.
You're as thin as a starved cat. I guess it's from missing the old Army beans. Here, I figured that maybe you could use some eating supplies yourself. - Gold! Well, where'd you get it? - Off our claim.
And you no longer lame my favorite horse. Sam has never forgiven the. No, thanks. But that was long after. Do not write that much. You are very good. married up. -With the French?
Maybe we'll find out now. Good day, young sirs. I have come to welcome you. We'd be very grateful if you'd tell us what all this means. It means that the prophecy of the two birds... of the fairest color has been fulfilled. It is a very old one.
"Maybe you think that you could make..." I had landed myself in the driveway of some big mansion that looked run-down and deserted. At the end of the drive was a lovely sight indeed, a great big empty garage, just standing there, going to waste. If ever there was a place to stash away a limping car with a hot license number. There was another occupant in that garage, an enormous, foreign-built automobile. It must have burned up ten gallons to a mile.
- No, but I could get a job. Well, now. I think maybe you are a musician. Yes, sir. And that kid out there he had a perfect ear for it. He could hear it, and he could feel it.
They expect me to shine daily, hourly. And for whom? For the people. For that foul-smelling rabble. It's so hot today. This heat of Rome oppresses me.
You come one step closer, I'll murder you with this saucepan. - l can't imagine a more glorious death. - l'm warning you, Andre. I know. But if I took any notice, how insulting it would be. If I hadn't come back, I doubt you would have lasted the year out. Think of this, a sword is like a bird.
No, I don't hate you but I'm getting out just the same. - Do you still want to make that bet? - Name it. Remember, I'm not in the same league with you, financially. Take my car. If I'm wrong, it's yours.
Oh, darling, you've had a chef in to do this. Oh, Henry, don't be so silly. Maud? Just a second, darling! Your cocoa is nearly ready. Ten o'clock! Oh, darling, this is a surprise! I made it myself from a new recipe.
- MacRoberts? - Same thing last night, sir. - On the move all along the front. - Yes. I think you'll find pressure all around our defences. However, it seems to me that this hill, Ed Duda, is a key position.
Your voice in my ears, your image in my eyes. Waking and sleeping, you were with me. And even more, since it happened. - Since what happened? - Every evening of the voyage, a star appeared above the bow, standing bright and steady in the sky, as if sent to guide the ship home. In my illness, I thought you had sent it as a sign.
So do I, with you. And we have to save the professor in spite of himself. You once said you had a plan. Well, have you? - Yeah, I got a plan. - Well?
Cheers, Johannes. - Cheers, Robert. Afterwards, they wandered through the old streets. It was a stroll through a thousand memories. The post box is still there. - It'll outlive us.
I have hidden it from you until now: The rehearsals are agonizing. also for me. - What do you mean? At times I think this music is a monstrosity. My friend BüIow believes it could send a person mad.
Once we can control that, we're ready for the ultimate test: On humans. There mustn't be a mistake this time. - I'll be back in a couple of hours. - All right, Steve. Science is science, but a girl must get her hair done. You'd better hurry though, if you're going to catch that bus.
His Excellency, the ambassador from the court of France. - Your Majesty. My lords. - We are honoured, monsieur. May I compliment you once again on this most beautiful palace? There is no other like it in all of Europe.
-Except what? Joseph, it's true. It does bring out the colour in your beautiful, big, brown eyes. Oh, to be a painter! What a beautiful turkey. Where'd you get it?
We'll try it again. Should Bunny Watson marry Mike Cutler? Question mark. Oh, wait a minute. I thought you said this machine can't evaluate. Can't. Can't.
No, Miss Prescott, don't say that. The great American woman, who stands out there naked, waiting for me to tell her what to wear. It doesn't speak. And if it won't speak to me, it won't speak to anyone. A magazine must be like a human being. If it comes into the home it must contribute.
You haven't quite got it. Now, listen carefully. You are in the Museum of Modern Art, Marion. Deep, Marion. Profound, Marion. You have come across this statue.
- Did you all hear that? - And what message will you convey? Seven times in the past 29 years, without our once suspecting it the computer has suggested certain changes in its own design which we blindly carried out. Each one having to do with its feedback system. The thing's forebrain. Now it's achieved true thought. True personality.
Each one having to do with its feedback system. The thing's forebrain. Now it's achieved true thought. True personality. It lives. Life, consciousness, a machine? An intellect enormously more powerful and efficient even than yours, professor.
Ariane? Ariane! Is my lunch ready? How about lunch? No, thank you, Papa. Ariane, is this yours? - Yes, Papa.
- We're going to the mill, the shod way. Get down to the mill! Come on! Take cover! Here. There's a mine shaft at the end of these cables.
Why kid yourself? We're not gonna get out of this. Maybe you're not, but I am. I'll guarantee you of that. See that cockroach? Tomorrow morning, we'll be dead and it'll be alive.
Afterwards we'll take them. So you going? Grisha! Once before we went like this to Yagodnoye. Only our bundle was bigger and we were younger. Why do you carry your rifle?
It's a Mauser. That's right. A customary weapon. It will last a lifetime. It's bit bulky though. It's more suitable for a glove compartment. In any case, it's pretty impressive.
That's just the trouble, officers. I can't open up. I'm John Courtney, and I'm locked in my own office. Well, how'd you come to lock yourself in? I was working last night and I jammed the key in the lock and then I turned it and broke it off. You can find it down there under the lock, I think, on the floor.
You're a little bit like a mother-in-law. Mother-in-law will just marry earlier. That will solve all the problems. - You don't have to go that far. - I exaggerate, and you know it. But Anne's way of living is better than ours, and I have to face it. Good, then face it.
I wish to share with you the faith from which it comes. City recorder, close the books of Yang Cheng with this entry. As a sign of respect for the honored foot inspector of this city, the Hsien Chang of Yang Cheng has become a Christian. I thank you for this... For this great gift. I can't... I can't... Jen-ai, accept my gift.
- Can't you see? - Now, there you are. - Thank you. I'm just about ready. All I've gotta do is find my lipstick. Where did I put it?
A psychic shock which creates an almost overwhelming tension which the person in shock must alleviate. In Lt. Manion's case, a soldier it is only natural that he would turn to action. Only direct, simple action against Barney Quill would relieve this unbearable tension. This is not uncommon. For example, in combat, some of the more remarkable heroics take place in this state of mind. Is there another name for this state we might be more likely to recognise?
- Barrymore. - Sir? That room at the end of the corridor upstairs: Has it been used lately? - Not for some time, sir. - I see. I think you'll find a candle burning near the window in that room. Do kindly extinguish it.
I think that they would all be very afraid. - I'm glad the warning apparatus works. - Of course. - Come on, Papa, please! - For how long? It could be some time. Then I have to remove the detonator.
I think I've found a name for it. The Tingler. You like it? The Tingler? Why not? Since we don't know what it is yet, we can't give it a Latin name. Tingler.
You don't know how it was. I know exactly how it was. What are you going to do? First, I'm going to put The Tingler back where it came from. So that if it can die, it will. And then I'll call the police.
-Just rest now. -I can't get the car started. -No? I think it's the ignition. Must've gone out when I went through that fence. How sad.
Religion is love. And love is the morning and the evening star. Love, the eternal glorious musicmaker. Love! Not the carnal love, but the divine love. And where does this great love come from?
- Let's have a matched pair, him and me. I'll not fight like a gladiator! You keep staring at this. Do you recognize this baton? - Yes! - You should!
Obey your rectoress in all things. You will return now to your chambers. The crown......is it ready ? Your beneficence. This ? .... This gross piece to be worn on the altar of Chemosh? It's heavy and dead.
You will return now to your chambers. The crown......is it ready ? Your beneficence. This ? .... This gross piece to be worn on the altar of Chemosh? It's heavy and dead. It lacks luster.
A man. His face is a blur. Now, nothing! The cloud again. The dark cloud. It covers everything.

There is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man. It is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity.
Just a few minutes. A few seconds. A few seconds more, as if you still hesitated to part with him, with yourself, as if his silhouette, now gray, might still reappear, here where you had imagined him too insistently, too fearfully, or too hopefully, for fear of losing this bond - No, that hope is now fruitless. Gone is the fear of losing that bond, that confinement, that falsehood. That entire story is now over.
- Are you afraid of the thunder? - A darned violent fear. - The thunderstorms in Switzerland... - Did you like it there otherwise? I was homesick. But I wasn't coming home until I'd finished the novel.
You're traveling through another dimension- a dimension not only of sight and sound, but of mind, a journey into a wondrous land whose boundaries are that of imagination. Your next stop, the twilight zone. This road is the afterwards of the civil war. It began at fort sumter, south carolina, and ended at a place called appomattox.
- Listen, Olsen. - Yes? I'd like to do something to help your paper. I was given a pearl necklace. You could pawn it. Thank you.
I ask you to make ready. This is obviously no place for a sword duel. It's a bit far, but I must ask you to accompany me to Gojiin-gawara. As miserable a hovel as this is, your landlord will be inconvenienced if you do not return. And without someone to retrieve your remains, your soul will wander aimlessly. I suggest you leave a note.
- Only...which way? See, I'm due back by five and... - A jeep like this might come in handy. - It sure would. We have this major who makes us stand reveille every morning, rain or shine, which gives you an idea... If we kept it on the move, it'd sound like a lot of jeeps.
I've already published six books, but no Italian author is able to live from writing. Venice was so good to award me an honorary research project: Reconstruction of political murders from the 14th century. The misdeeds of our elders keep us fed today. I sit there all night, betraying the Republic of Venice. You see, I am writing a novel instead of doing historical research.
Oh, no. It wasn't that she was just pretty. She was different. She was so alive. I was cleaning the cage. The bird got out. But where is it now?
Did you deserve to be sent an angel? Why you? God chose a simple girl as intermediary. Where did the angel fiind the crown? I trust God. I don't know where. Did the crown smell good?
That doesn't belong to Marianne. Glauert in Lunteren was shot with this gun. We have scientific proof. Is this your gun? - Yes. I thought so.
There are those who fear Caesar's ambition. But what is to fear? That he will destroy the republic? Yes, he will. I promise you he will. Your tongue is old but sharp, Cicero.
Brutus. By that honor and by the responsibility you carry Brutus, save Rome from Caesar! You cannot ask me to destroy him. Then let Caesar destroy Rome. Antony has just come from a meeting of my friends with good news. Tomorrow at the Senate, Lucius Cotta will move that I be made king.
Then let Caesar destroy Rome. Antony has just come from a meeting of my friends with good news. Tomorrow at the Senate, Lucius Cotta will move that I be made king. It will pass. But I don't understand. King and emperor.
There is Egypt. And so once more, the Romans warred upon each other. And just as Antony had foretold the forces of Octavian came to meet them on the spot where they landed. Which was at Actium, in Greece. Action begins with the rise of the sun. Your plan is brave and simple.
"Be happy." Sure, more like that. "Worries over. Be happy." My letter? Throw it away.
The house is calling you. I've waited such a long time. Is this what I came so far to find? Don't let me go! Theo, stay with me! You won't believe this, but five minutes ago I left this door open... so you could find your way.
Hey, that's not good. The birds won't come near this island? Sakuda! Over there! This island is a ship's graveyard. Maybe it's the current.
Me, Zorba. P.S., I forgot to tell you. Monsieur. Pardon. They told me you had a letter. It's from him?
Upstairs, end of the hall. I have to tell you something. You can tell us later. Upstairs? What's with the door? It won't open.
You can tell us later. Upstairs? What's with the door? It won't open. - Is it locked? - It can't be.
You're backup man on fire control, aren't you? Yes, sir. Do our Vindicator missiles have both infrared- and radar-seeking capacity? Yes, sir. Loud and clear! They've got to know we're on the level!
They contain Delta 9. - Delta 9? - What's that? An invisible nerve gas which disperses 1 5 minutes after inducing complete unconsciousness for 24 hours. Tomorrow at dawn, the flying circus of my personal pilot, Miss Pussy Galore, will spray it into the atmosphere. Once the population, including the military, has been immobilized, my task force, which Mr. Strap had his people smuggle across the Rio Grande from Mexico, will approach Fort Knox in motorized equipment along Bullion Boulevard which runs past the depository here, and intersects with Gold Vault Road. This fence surrounding the depository, as Mr. Strap reminded us, is electrified.
I was wrong. Forgive me. I wore the mask to scare you away from him. Now I'm being punished for it! The mask won't come off! Why won't it come off? Why won't it come off?
Discontinued Lines. Relics of a by-gone age. Yes, sir. A glorious age. Gracious, leisurely, orderly. A time for many things. A machine was a thing ofjoy then, built to last a man's lifetime.
There might have been a false bottom with a bomb inside. We'll never know. That's enough, Martin. We have to start from scratch. The only information we have concerns the organization's structure. Let's start from there.
That's a great proposition from your own wife! Emma. I told you we're starting the marriage right now. I'm staying here. No. You're going. I have to send you off to your flea- bitten war.
- Now, don't try to cheapen it with words. Call it a power or a force that we are going to release. Perhaps it's in yourself - something in you. What does that matter? You could touch an H bomb and say, "l know what's in there, uranium and stuff... that is all."
Mr Fennan, we know it's idiotic, but when the Foreign Secretary finds that sort of letter in his in-tray, it's like London airport getting an anonymous phone call to say that there's a bomb on the Prime Minister's plane, and somebody's got to do a check. - Was the letter anonymous? - Yes.
The point is, the Foreign Office believe the police. It's unfortunate that in this distressing matter we are now answerable to the two public bodies with whom our current relations are most, shall I say, uneasy. Lf, of course, there are facts not included in your confidential report which point to Fennan's suicide for reasons other than his interview with you, I shall be happy to hear about them. Are there? - Have they opened his suicide letter? - They're photostatting the original.
Captain, if your crew saw you carry me here... My crew is sworn to secrecy. But my reputation. I mean, just having met like this. Of course, it would be different if you cared for me. Do you want me to manufacture a lie?
Do you think...? Listen, I think that our profession, the art of cinema, doesn't just belong to this century. I think it's an art for young people. You think it's more of a young person's art. I think so too. Let me tell you something. I have been thinking a lot... I've written a film that I never made.
It just occurred to me a brilliant idea, son. A very good. At the first opportunity buy two or three branded whiskey bottles. It's just a small investment. What am I going to multiply. The Spider was here. I told you I was here. And I know how to cross the River.
- Young man. - Yes? You just want me to have this flower? - Don't know who I am? - It doesn't matter. What matters is the flower.
What if it's the only way? Let's do it! All right. After destroying lnawashiro Dam, Guilala is now heading for the Pacific coast. Commander, it's from FAFC. What?
After destroying lnawashiro Dam, Guilala is now heading for the Pacific coast. Commander, it's from FAFC. What? It destroyed the Atomic Research Center and power plant? It absorbed all the atomic energy and is stronger than ever? It's turned into a ball of energy, bouncing from place to place.
How would you like to go to sleep and wake up in a new world? It's out there waiting for you. We'll need your help to get away. You've got it. You think this Companion can do anything. I said it was very powerful.
There must be another answer. Something in the sun killed that thing, before the Denevan died. All right. You've tried heat... radiation... What other qualities or properties does the sun have? It exists physically.
Something in the sun killed that thing, before the Denevan died. All right. You've tried heat... radiation... What other qualities or properties does the sun have? It exists physically. It occupies space.
All right. You've tried heat... radiation... What other qualities or properties does the sun have? It exists physically. It occupies space. It has mass, therefore gravity.
Depending on what we find. - What do you believe now? - That the crystals aren't on your ship. - Mr Spock? - Unable to locate the radiation. Why not? You spotted it from the Enterprise.
An ancient Earth legend, Mr Spock. A changeling was a fairy child that was left in place of a human baby. The changeling assumed the identity of the human child. So it is to sterilise. And for "sterilise" read "kill". And it has the power and the sophistication to do it.

Stand by. Good luck, gentlemen. Happiness at least, sir. And... now. I've seen old photographs of this period. An economic upheaval had occurred.
Come on. He never had a chance to fire. It's only seconds since he screamed. The creature must still be around. Captain. What is it?
Lt's women's talk! I could go to my old teacher Makino... he's the only honest man i know. Would he be able to help me in my doubt? I envy you. You have a marvellous garden, Makino. I'm glad you like it, my Lord.
I'm sorry. I say tell him off. Hogan, maybe you're right. After all, what have you got to lose? You can always fall back on the firing squad. Klink, I have just come from that mine.
- You heard me, my dear. I was acquainting you with the fact of a murder that my brother, Lord Henry Beverton, and Doctor Adams planned to commit. But what I can I do? Sir John isn't here. - In any case you've got to do something! The hypo that I gave him should last for about one hour.
What size is the film? Four-and-a-half-inch reel... 16 millimeter... in an insulated aluminum capsule. And all of a sudden, you know a whole damn lot about my business. We don't believe in going on a mission totally blindfolded, Mr. Jones. The film came out of a camera... - mounted in a Russian satellite.
Sometimes I think. I pick up an object. This pen is red... But it writes black. Deceiving appearances... It's a very common pencil.
I pick up an object. This pen is red... But it writes black. Deceiving appearances... It's a very common pencil. It has a point like a pencil.
My associates, Mr. Dober and Mr. Brook. It occurred to me that nowhere in the rules does it state a tournament player may not take advantage of any aid he can. Oh, then you're interested? I would like to see the computer in action once more, please. I don't see why not. Turn it on.
Suppose I tell you a secret about your friend Webster. Are you prepared to do business? - Go. - Webster killed George Corley for a piece of jewellery worth $10 million. What, this crown thing? This crown thing was worn by the Empress Theodora in the fifth century.
Are you prepared to do business? - Go. - Webster killed George Corley for a piece of jewellery worth $10 million. What, this crown thing? This crown thing was worn by the Empress Theodora in the fifth century. Six months ago, it was stolen from the Athens state museum by George Corley.
It's not the sun up in the sky. It's the Son of God. Caesar and Christ. They had them both. And the word is spreading only now. A philosophy of total love and total brotherhood.
No. Scott to captain. - Kirk here. - I've got bad news, captain. The entire dilithium-crystal-converter assembly is fused. No chance of repair.
Herr Commandant, I want to report that... I found this. Good. If nobody claims it, you can keep it. Now get out. Wait a minute. Where did you find this parachute?
He's too good a businessman not to. Now, Barney, are you sure the gas in this cylinder is not dangerous? Quite sure, Jim. It'll knock him unconscious. It'll mimic all the symptoms of Beck's bacteria. What about the pill? I'll attach it to the seat of the chair.
Polly. Now, that's what I call a dead parrot. No, no. It's stunned. Look, my lad, I've had just about enough of this. That parrot is definitely deceased. And when I bought it not half an hour ago you assured me that its lack of movement was due to it being tired and shagged out after a long squawk.
Bugler, sound recall. It's over. It's over. Corporal Clemens, sir, from Masters' Brigade at Dante's Crossroads. Who gave you permission to come ridin' across the face of my command yelling' like a fool? Have you got a message for me from General Masters? Yes, sir.
The previous ships probably spread the disease all through their people. The supply ship that she was waiting for never came. All these thousands of years she's been waiting to greet people who were dead. To do the job of defence, the computer projected a replica of the only image available: Losira's. The computer was too perfect.
However, as I understand it, I am Dr. Janice Lester. That's very clever. But I didn't say it. I said the body of James Kirk is being used by Dr. Janice Lester. A subtlety that somehow escapes me. I assume that this switch was arrived at by mutual agreement. No.
Just until the thief is found. That's quite impossible. The safe is for official business only. Yeah, I... I understand, sir. You take it. I'd rather you have it than some contemptible sneak thief.
Wait. Please. Please wait. Please. As it was addressed to you, sir, I thought you might like to have it. I opened it because I thought it might throw some light on all this.
- Where is it? - Where would you keep a rare bird? At the zoo. The cage is near the back ofthe zoo. Over there. - There? - Yes. They have to keep it isolated.
At the zoo. The cage is near the back ofthe zoo. Over there. - There? - Yes. They have to keep it isolated. It can't live with any other animals. Over there. But they'll have to move it.
Don't try to get any closer. Guerrero, listen to me. Do you hear me? Listen. They know about you on the ground. Your insurance is no good.
Guerrero, listen to me. Do you hear me? Listen. They know about you on the ground. Your insurance is no good. It's cancelled.
A cat? Was it a ghost-cat? Ridiculous. I'm telling the truth. That black cat loved the taste of blood. It kept licking at a dead man's face.
Sergeant, get back down to the main gate and get a three-tonner here for wounded. - Have you got the count yet? - Not yet, Major. Only ten dead, Connor. Thirty-seven not accounted for. I think we've located the tunnel, sir. Hold it.
Because it's hard. Will you take me with you? Maybe. Tell me, do you know someone called Rosemochronos...? - Is that your red hat? - Yes, it's mine. It's one of the red queen's hats.
So he suffers more If we kill them all now he'll have a bad time once then get over it Alright then So let's start with this one God, it's dumb It's dead
- Norwegian blues stun easily. - I've had enough of this. That parrot is definitely deceased, and when I bought it a half hour ago... you assured me that its total lack of movement... was due to it being tired and shagged out after a long squall. Well, he's pining for the fjords. Pinin' for the fjords? What kind of talk is that?
The key man, quite literally. This other key, and Wildfire itself, depend on your key. Wildfire's equipped with a nuclear device for self-destruct. In an emergency, it's activated automatically. I've just inserted the key in the main station that arms the mechanism. The device is ready for detonation. When? Never, we hope.
All kinds of observable differences. You see, Harold, I feel that much of the world's sorrow comes from people who are this... yet, allow themselves to be treated as that. Power steering. That little tree is in trouble. Come on. Look at it.
Therefore I think that I could... No... My bank cannot be involved with this. I say if this book ends up in the hands of someone ruthless it could become the source for countless blackmails! And I say the richest citizen of Appleby has to do his duty. This town was good to him.
- The weather... - Sir? The scirocco... How long do you think it will last? Well, you must understand, signore, that the scirocco... blows for three days if it starts on Tuesday. Nine days if it starts on Friday.
Wouldn't it be funny after all if you did have to arrest me? I mean, me trying to turn you on, and you trying to turn me in. I love this. I love your scar. You hate it, but I love it. No, I don't hate it.
Switch off! Stop, you're on the serial number. Set the dials on zero. Wait here. Is this your car? Belongs to a friend.
No, you were wrong. All right I've still got time! May I see your identification, please? Follow the trolley bus. Faster. And here, finally, is Hadriah's Arch.
All right I've still got time! May I see your identification, please? Follow the trolley bus. Faster. And here, finally, is Hadriah's Arch. It was built in the second century A.D. out of marble in the form of an arch supported by two Corinthian columns.
hmm. well, come along with me. no. i'd rather not be seen with you. huh. well, suit yourself. you see, the toad likes it. it's dead! quint says that, flora. it loves smoke so much that it has to have it all. horrible!
- What's the matter? - It's a wound in my leg. The war? No. A coffin fell on me. - Was it empty?
You have changed, and yet you haven't. I can see the shot now. The camera is up high. It descends slowly and follows you. You come forward, and it moves in on you. There's music, too.
Yes-- do you know, in our laboratories We have developed a cheese sandwich that can withstand An impact of up to 4,000 pounds per square inch? Good heavens! Amazing, isn't it? We've also developed a tomato Which can eject itself when an accident is imminent. Even when it's in an egg and tomato roll? Anywhere, even if it's in your stomach.
Come on, slanty man. Mush in a mess of wind. I said, come on. Your brother left some things in the bunkhouse. You want them? Where does your pebble walk to, grasshopper?
Will not the soul, too, see nothing when death blinks its eye? No. The soul sees always. Yet the body dies. Does the sun die? It does not shine at night.
No, no, no. Borrow. Borrow, I promise. I need the magic. I'd feel naked without it. No, I won't lose it. I promise.
No. What is it? It's missing. Must be in the fuel line. Well, straighten it out. I'm trying to, man. The controls won't answer.
- Okay. - I'll catch up with you. - Okay. I found a lid. It was laying on the ground. Put that down.
-Sorry? The original driving license. The one I said I wanted back. I thought we might have a chat about that. The fact is, the original driving license is not here. But don't worry.
Nice sight, huh, kid? We'll ride that bastard yet. Oughta keep you alive till we get to Salem. Here she comes. Stay back from the train till it stops. Hurry up, dear.
Baptist? Oh, no. Much more ancient than that. The church that all the others came from. The ceremony that goes so far back no one knows when it began. What's it like?
I didn't even know the guy was dead till she called. Look, I don't know anything. - I just passed on some information. - Like what? We've got this freighter. It's called Star of the East.
Look, I don't know anything. - I just passed on some information. - Like what? We've got this freighter. It's called Star of the East. It goes to the Orient and back.
So now what? I don't know. You never did. Where's the gun? - What do you want the gun for? - To get rid of it.
Captain, an island. If it is here, then it can only be one place. - Lemuria. - Lemuria? The mythical island. Mariners have searched for it for centuries. It is all that is left of a mighty continent now sunk beneath the waves.
Why are you doing all this? Lucita and I have broken all the rules. I have found refuge in a place where the presence of a man is a sacrilege. You should hate me rather than protect me. You should denounce me to the Inquisition. Your story touched me.
You'd have bled to death by then. Can you hold a pen? —I'll try. Yes, jolly good. You know, it's a hell of a nuisance, all this damn paperwork. Really, it is. It's a real nightmare, this paperwork.
Don't destroy the vortex. Let us renew it. A better breed could prosper here, given time. Time? Wasn't eternity enough? This place is against life.
- I know that. - What does it read, honey? 12,000 feet. All right. The airspeed indicator is to the left. I know that too.
You got 12 other guys in this town you could use. Why me, huh? That's right, but you're family, Felton. Don't you understand? You're family. KELLER: Jewellery store.
That's no police dog! That dog's not exactly a police dog, he's more of an Airedale. Look at that coat. Some coat! That dog will never bother you with catching a cold. I think it's cute.
Hmm. I have my own advertising slogan: Try me. I'm delicious. See this chocolate complexion? Try it.
These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilisations, to boldly go where no man has gone before. Captain's Log, Stardate 6063.4. The Enterprise is tracing the origin of a mysterious alien space probe. It approached the Federation home worlds, made a scan of Earth's system, and then signalled outward into space.
Mr Arex, prepare to compensate for warp catapult effect. When we break free, we will be thrown approximately 5.698 light-years. Compensation factors laid in, sir. But how are you going to break free? The force globe is flexible in only one direction per unit of time. We shall both push and pull on it simultaneously.
Over there... Down there... Go down there. It's empty. The church is empty. It rules no more it condemns no longer it means nothing anymore.
Here? Or here? Or here? - Morning, Fawlty. - Good morning, Major. I'm so sorry, I'm afraid the dining room door seems to have disappeared. Oh, yes, so it has.
One moment please. Good afternoon. Oh it's you, forg ive me, I d idn't recognize you. What can we do for you? Well, it's about this wig. I would like to have it cleaned and combed
Good afternoon. Oh it's you, forg ive me, I d idn't recognize you. What can we do for you? Well, it's about this wig. I would like to have it cleaned and combed It is pretty bad condition.
Where's a cute little tune? They kick you out after 22 years, they ought to have a brass band. Don't get upset. You're gonna get sick. You know where my music is? There it is.
It's fifteen versts to the town. It's going to be dark soon. That's all right, don't worry. A man has but one body, Like a single cell. The soul is sick and tired Of its too solid shell, With ears, mouth, eyes The size of a nickel coin And skin all scarred and diced, Spread over a skeleton. Through cornea it wings To a heavenly spring, To ice-laden slings, To a chariot birds bring.
I'd think what a mad, impetuous, wonderful fool he is. - Don't! - I must! - We just ate. - Your skin, it is so beautiful. Yes, I know.
I have considered your situation most carefully, and I have searched my mind and my conscience for a solution. But this is not a charitable institution. And as your fees have not been forthcoming, I have been forced to make certain arrangements on your behalf. You will be returned to the orphanage. You still thinking about that bloody rock? I can't help it.
I am a specialist. Excellency, does this situation remind you of anything? Well? Ferraggi! Are you ready? Just a moment! The act of sodomy contains the death of the human species.
-Who do you think it is? You're supposed to be up here by now. -I know... I was held up. That's no excuse. Come on. Does this trip matter to you?
No, we can't stop the train. Why not? Listen to this. We've put a bomb on the Hikari 109 The bomb will be activated at 80km/hour It's safe while the train stays at over 80km/hour
Tsutsumi is down there now. Was the contraption connected to the goods train wheel? Yes. It was attached to the rear wheel frame of the locomotive. Then we can't remove it from the inside. Why not?
But Kuramochi, if it exploded in a crowded area, it would kill thousands more people. I resent the order as much as you do. But this is a time when you must choose the lesser evil. But... We found it! We found the bomb!
I'm not going with you! -Know what's in this case? Look! Like it, don't you? Bastard! Yes, you like it.
(Kermit) No, no, you don't want to see the acrobatic act. - And one, and... (all) Whoa, whoa, whoa! Cute act. I'm sorry about that, Miss Henderson, but... Listen, we'll be back next week with another vital question for our panel: "Do attack dogs make good house pets?" wake me when the show starts.
Mama, I'm sorry. Mama? Would you take a look at this tomato? That's a beaut. That is a whopper! It's a ponderosa.
- You sure looked funny. - Yeah, you should've seen yourself. We had fun, though. You gonna put all that stuff into your novel? Every bit of it. It's gonna be something, you know.
Friendly. He's a little odd. He talks about murdered whales and piles of schrimps. Even better. I've found an apartment. It goes with the job. Fantastic!
I want to help them do things, say things, sing. Senior citizens... Third rate citizens. That's your third world! The onion's a great vegetable. Democratic, it grows everywhere. Its skin is thick, protecting it from the cold. It's considered vulgar.
Senior citizens... Third rate citizens. That's your third world! The onion's a great vegetable. Democratic, it grows everywhere. Its skin is thick, protecting it from the cold. It's considered vulgar. It gives flavour to everything. It lasts. You can eat it raw or cooked.
- I really want to know. You can use your kung fu to kill anyone in an instant. Killing a man is nothing. Sparing a man's life-- that's something. Is that the famous Killer Meteor? That's right.
Good. There will be damnation. Maybe I can't see you after that. After you leave the temple, you must teach this Fist set... to Yan Yongchuen. Yes, master. This Fist set is designed for girls.
You didn't tell me. What's happening? We organised a surprise for Etienne. Hello, children. I'm not staying. I just wanted to thank godmother for the beautiful jumper. - Did Etienne give it to you?
- Hi, Ben. - Well, hello, Darlene. What's the matter? Well, I've never seen you wearing a hat before. Well, how do you like it? It's real cute.
Such a distinguished man. When did you move to Germany? My husband was... Is German. I remember the wedding announcement. So elegant.
You're not gonna give up your apartment, are you? Of course. - But why? - I'm moving in with you. - But you've got a nice apartment. - I have a tiny apartment.
Of course. - But why? - I'm moving in with you. - But you've got a nice apartment. - I have a tiny apartment. - I know it's small.
- I'm moving in with you. - But you've got a nice apartment. - I have a tiny apartment. - I know it's small. - And it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Granted.
My problem is I don't just need drop zones. I need drop zones I can hold and defend. The rest of my division arrives with the second drop and General Sosabowski's Polish brigade with the third. I understand, sir. But we really think we found the right place. It's large enough for your needs, it's flat and firm, and also easily defended.
I need drop zones I can hold and defend. The rest of my division arrives with the second drop and General Sosabowski's Polish brigade with the third. I understand, sir. But we really think we found the right place. It's large enough for your needs, it's flat and firm, and also easily defended. Well, where the hell is it?
No. It knew him, though. - How do you know that? - It called his name. Did the demon seem to expect Father Merrin? Yes.
- Here. Snowflake! So there you are! That is Snowflake. - Isn't he cute! The train leaves the city with a white dream on board.
It's two wine to one water still. It can't hold at that rate. They're lucky to get wine. Is that all? I detected a certain oneness in the last consignment. That's odd.
Well, I am getting my clothes, you fool. Good idea. Why don't you slip into somethin' comfortable? Are we really going 110? We're going 110! Why do you wear that cowboy hat?
Unless you find the Red Python. The Red Python? It's a huge snake with red scales. You're so strange, you keep talking about snakes. As long as you find this big snake, suck up its blood, and you'll have invincible power. Unbelievable.
Oh, the publisher... I don't know if he's a publisher, but he's definitely rich... - Well, those lucky publishers! - Yeah, lucky them! We picked the wrong profession! Would you like me to clean it, sir?
Our forces have taken prisoners near the spacedrome. They tell of survivors who escaped in ships. What ships? How far can they go? If a handful of survivors did escape, they would have neither fuel nor food for a long voyage. The information is not complete.
Those of us here assembled now... represent the only known surviving colonies, save one. A sister world, far out in the universe... remembered to us only through ancient writings. It is my intention to seek out that remaining colony... that last outpost of humanity in the whole universe. Commander Adama. This 13th colony, this other world-- Where is it and what is it called?
- Your friend Geiger gave you a key. Why don't you shoot me? Seems to be three people who have a key to this house. You, me and Eddie Mars. That means you or Eddie Mars dragged Geiger's body out of here and hid it. I think you.
Well... Good night, Jim. Good morning. What do you want? My arm hurts. It's dead.
Hey, get the dude, man. - What did she give him? - A lock of hair from her chest. Poor Kenickie. See a penny, pick it up, all day long you'll have good luck. Give me that.
And I guess it's easier to kill what you consider inferior. Look, over here, we run the country. I'll get Frank. - Frank, this is Dr. Forest. - Come in. The mobile unit has arrived.
- I'm going sailing. - Again? - What else is there to do? - What about that job? Do I have to? He doesn't have to.
What's up in town? - Same as usual. - I bet you miss it, Jack, huh? I bet you miss selling' whatever it was. That plastic fruit. No. Got the river.
Hey, what are you doing? Don't you know? What do you want? I'll go tell my dad No one's told me about it. I'll let you go this time
Bigwig, I need runners. Dandelion, Blackberry. Hyzenthlay can run. Good. We've hardly any time. I've got a plan.
CONTROL THESE TOMATOES BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE? QUESTIONS, QUESTIONS. YOU MISSED YOUR CALLING. MR. DIXON, HAVE YOU HAD LUNCH YET? HERE. HAVE A TOMATO. (Chuckles) DON'T BE AFRAID.
We'll make a guess. Plot a point where we might intercept the Celestra at an angle. Assuming they're moving at top speed... Factor four. Assuming they're at factor four, the computer should tell us where they are. But it won't!
Tulse Luper said, if in need, I should play this map like a blank in a card game. It might get me out of trouble. For encouragement, I had some reason to think that I had a guide. The 21st map. The map of a conscientious cartographer. This map had been a legal orthodox buy from an antiquarian's bookshop.
(screams) Get her up! Get her up, get her up! (Ash walls) It's an android! Jesus...
Because he may know how to kill it. Ash, can you hear me? (electronic voice) Yes, I can hear you. What was your special order? You read it. I thought it was clear.
Yeah. This old fiddle, it don't belong to me but I've looked after it for quite a while. Now, I think it's about time somebody else looked after it. Zadok, I'm not sure what you mean. Well, if you hold your tater a minute, Cousin John, I'm gonna tell you. This old fiddle is 108 year old.
- Very young. Hello, children. Who are you? Where are you from? Do you bring news? Does the world really exist? Does the sun really shine? Yes. we've seen it.
Hello, children. Who are you? Where are you from? Do you bring news? Does the world really exist? Does the sun really shine? Yes. we've seen it. What is it like?
Where are you from? Do you bring news? Does the world really exist? Does the sun really shine? Yes. we've seen it. What is it like? It's bright and yellow.
It has a brick fireplace and a cute bedroom with mirrors on the ceiling and... Red Leader! Red Leader, I'm going down! Captain Geline. He think he's a pilot, still fighting the war. I've found the tunnel, Johnson!
In the past few hours, many things have happened but rumors of nuclear attacks and a third world war are totally untrue. We have no reason to believe that any aggression has been taken against our homes and families. I believe that what we have stumbled across is not man-made but a phenomena of nature. One that can't be explained. Now, this phenomena is a storm which the Nimitz went through less than 18 hours ago. This storm has had some effect on time as we know it.
Summoned by the drums to fight My comrade, marching at my side Advanced in step with me Advanced in step with me A bullet came flying free Meant for you or meant for me?
- He didn't. Not after that. [LAUGHS] This reminds me of the quilting bees we used to have in the old days. It's been ages since I caught up on all the gossip. I'm sure we would never have finished our gowns in time if it weren't for your help. We know Mama's sewing machine.
Not much satisfaction from having your name on the silver sconce when you're six feet under! Incidentally, Master, to change the subject completely when do you award your honorary doctorates? The ceremony's not for a few months, but we have to decide in two weeks. - Doctorate? - Aren't they decided? There is one Doctorate of Law still to be decided.
- Wait a minute. I want to answer this. - I read the file. - Did you, now? How did you come to read the file? I was talking with Mr Rosen.
West towards the great Inland Sea. All your faith is based on this? This and the seat of my pants. Where did you get it? In a Cairo museum. 1000 years old. An Egyptian expedition found a graveyard full of ivory near the great Inland Sea.
Don't worry about it. I am worried about it! I am worried about it! Drive the car! - What is all this stuff? - It's a computer, Marty. Yeah, but h-how does it manage to drive itself?
It does not take a security genius to hire an armed car service. Mr. Hunter, this is only... I've got 2.6 million dollars worth of gems arriving' tomorrow. Anybody wants to take a shot at 'em, all they gotta do... is blow that tin can apart and run like hell. If they do, they'll come up empty. The art of security is a lot like a magic act, Mr. Hunter.
For your own safety please clear the streets. Stay in your houses and await instructions. I repeat: This is a police emergency. Clear the streets at once! They found Rambo's body.
- Baked potato. - How'd it go? - Terrible. - Did you rewrite the last scene? - I did the necktie scene. How is it?
He'd be disappointed. The Pink Panther is in my safe at... Your Highness, please. Don't say it, not here. Your Highness, I read there was a dispute over the ownership of the Pink Panther. It belongs to me.
Geez! The shell hit the roof! Bad sign! The front is drawing close on us! I saw it with my own eyes going out of the window. What did it look like?
That's for my window in my van. And here's for my tire. I don't have to fight with you. 'Cause when its all over, you boys are just gonna be hung out to dry in that town. GAINES: The water's too deep for them vets to bring up. And all I have to do is wait... till that place dries up and blows away.
The results of the test. Oh, yes, the Helios scores. Of course. You didn't grade mine, did you? I just took it to keep Devon company. Well, as you know, the Helios test is not merely an entrance examination. It is widely acknowledged as the most accurate measure of innate intelligence.
I know everyone who's anyone in the gold business. Dan Curtin was a scavenger. A dirty fingernailed gold digger. An odd vilification, considering your own profession. Profession is right, Mr. Steele. Follow me. I've rented myself a piece of an Italian earth survey satellite.
- That's it? Couldn't I just pick up a comb at the hospital pharmacy? No, Amanda, I need the black comb with the two missing teeth the one with "Ace Comb" stamped on the side. Where will I find this item? - In the bathroom? - Oh, Amanda, come on.
Yes. How much did you see? All of it, I guess. - Just a little old crummy music box. - Right. The music box. But I'm not the one who broke it.
You think so? I think Mandelstam will have a heart attack. Tom, these tapes are worth a fortune. I mean, we have made history here. We have actually shown that there is a clock. We have actually shown that it can be tampered with.
Oh. Either way, it doesn't matter. Vicki, can I help you with that Kool-Aid? Please? eddie: Mm-mm-mm. I don't know why they call this stuff Hamburger Helper. lt does just fine by itself.
Nigel, please. Just go back to your desk. Find out where Largo's boat is at the moment. Call me later. I'll be at my hotel. Jolly good. I'll get onto that at once. And take full advantage of the natural cover. Is this The Flying Saucer?
The Romanov Star. Stay here with the jewellery while they switch the car to the main track. You stay, also. 1 00 kiloton yield. The effects are indistinguishable from the American medium-yield bomb. The detonator, now listen carefully.
There's so much work to do, anyway. More tests training studying. What about after? After hours I'll run a lot. I'm going to get up to five miles a day. There's a beautiful, long beach there.
Gus has just come back from the second trip in space. Betty, how do you feel about this trip? I'm so proud of him. I think he was wonderful. We're all proud of Gus Grissom. Gus, how do you feel about the trip? Was it a success?
You know, I worry about that kid. Why? Sometimes I think we're all gonna get electrocuted. This corn is raw! I know. Isn't it wonderful?
Sometimes I think we're all gonna get electrocuted. This corn is raw! I know. Isn't it wonderful? It's so crisp. - Of course it's crisp!
Excellent. It's been a long time. Can you explain the removal of your user account on June 23rd, 1973? They must have told it he died. People sometimes make... mistakes. - Yes, they do.
Steven will stop you at the door. -We've counterfeited the passes. -All right. Say you do get inside, you have no chance against his troops. We'll handle them. This scheme is so reckless. It's ill-conceived.
Please forgive me, but my life is in danger too. My client is very impatient. If I don't fulfill my mission, I'll be killed. That's why I need the formula. But where? Where do I have it?
It's gotta be. And Louis himself McCarthy is drivin'. Then somebody else was drivin' that boat on the way out. Hey, Castillo, this is Tubbs. Yeah? [ Tubbs ] They've got it!
But when we came home, the car was in the driveway and the hood was up... but the work wasn't completed. Hasty departure, huh? - From this world, I suspect. What, you think Walter was murdered here? Mrs. Lindner, how long has that oil stain been on your driveway? Well, the gardeners were here yesterday morning. They would have cleaned it up.
- Meet the ball. - Get it started. - Let's go. Strike two! That looked good, St. James. Come on. Laura, I don't know what you're up to, but I've worked very hard to improve my swing... and I've no intention of going down to ignominious defeat with the bat on my shoulder. Take a look at the top of your bat, DiMaggio, and don't make it look obvious.
- I was Buzz Blade, Mrs. King. I could have been Buzz Blade forever. Except for that accident. Mr. Sinclair, I'm no expert on this sort of thing but I really think that you could use some help. The film was virtually complete the day of the explosion. They were able to release it.
BILLY: Yeah. Poor Fred. What about you, Amanda? When did you actually find out about the bomb? Oh. [CHUCKLES]
Please. I have no one else to turn to. -What is it? -It's unbelievable. The Direktor has actually torn up a huge section of my music. They say I have to rewrite the opera.
We're supposed to be asleep! Tell him. You're his father. Come on, son. Leave the bird alone. Then the bird's feather.
I'm eastbound in pursuit of a white Lamborghini. This is not a recording. Hey, thanks for the hose job! If I tell you boys something, you won't think I've been drinking, will ya? The white Lamborghini is vanished, but there's a red one behind me honking its horn. Correction!
The sleeper has awakened! Arrakis, Dune, Desert Planet. Your time has come. A storm is coming. Our storm.
I don't want it to know what we're doing. Mr. Johnson? Mr. Johnson? I'll be going in your house soon to get your baby. What modifications were made to the robot? I didn't make any modifications. I didn't touch that thing.
I told you not to open that. Close the bott... The bottom one first, and then the top one. - It's under the bed. Where? Oh. Willie, can you help me change the bag? It looks full.
I'm getting a tapping sound coming from the direction of the lab. I got a pretty big girder in my way here, though. Come on back to me one more time. I got some life down here, boys. Uh, MacGyver, the girder. Can you move it? Well, that'd take some doing.
James Garner, Rod Taylor. MGM, 1964. But that doesn't explain- Where have you been for the last 36 hours? At the Rexford Palms Hotel, apparently, flat on my back. Laura, all I remember is that after my Wednesday afternoon appointment... with B.J. Sinclair, it was suddenly Friday morning. Does the Colony Park Club ring any bells?
The stuff was gone. Were you afraid you left some clue behind? You needn't have bothered. Once they alerted me and I saw whose office was above the safe... I knew who pulled that job. I'm going to enjoy rubbing your nose in this someday, Keyes. Yeah, don't hold your breath, glamour boy. This nose of mine has a sense of its own... when it comes to knowing who's a crook and who isn't.
- Yes. Thank you very much. Very kind of you. [SIGHS] - What is it? - I made a mess of everything but it wasn't my fault. I didn't see the skateboard.
FRANCINE: Lee. Billy red-lined that vial through analysis. - And he just called with the results. LEE: Yeah?
Different department. I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They said you have a form I need to fill out. -Have you got an arrest receipt? -Yeah.
Like your legs, Alba. We are complementary. Of course, you are. What's the name of the piece at the back of the knee? - Hasn't got a name. - Oh, then I won't miss it. Lots of other common features haven't got names like this small piece of gristle that separates the nostrils.
We know what they are. They are the testicles. Bluntly put, it is a pussy. The testicles were boiled in soy sauce and the vagina has just a blood sauce. I suspect that it was dismembered during a menstruation. It looks like they had some trouble with this ingredient. They have used a liver with cancer and stewed it with curry sauce. This liver wouldn't have lasted 3 weeks due to the severe cancer.
You didn't want your golden bubble to burst, so you killed him! And then destroyed the evidence, because he was gonna turn it over to the I.R.S. Can't you people make up your minds? First you're accusing Ted, and now you're accusing me. Do you own a gun, Mrs. Goldblume? For protection?
- They've got the whole enchilada. - I'd better notify State. DOUGLAS: What's missing is the proximity bomb. It's our doomsday option. We can snuggle the HK-86 up close to the target, and then poof. How do you track it?
And then when the work was done we snuck out the back door just like they did. Clever, huh? Ha, ha. Yes, very clever, Mr. Simpson, very clever. Now, what is the back door? Well, the last wall we built, couldn't fortify it so we had to be real careful about hiding it.
Tracker online. Set the V-gain to filter RF ambient. Hudson, tracker online. Left and right, little buddy. 40 meters in, bearing 221, there should be a stairwell. Check.
I'll be in medlab. Check on Gorman, continue my analysis. Fine. You do that. This service tunnel must be how they move back and forth. That's right.
Give me that suit! 300 quid that suit cost me. You've torn it. Monk. Monk? You've torn the sleeve off a 300-guinea suit. Oh no, not the car! It's not mine. It's a customer's.
I was not pure. The teleporter insists on purity. I was not pure. I don't know what you mean. A fly got into the transmitter pod with me that first time when I was alone. The computer got confused. There weren't supposed to be two genetic patterns. And it decided to splice us together.
We need to dig a huge reservoir... and channel rainwater from the whole hillside. What if, one year, it doesn't rain? No, we need a field near a natural water source. I wonder... What if we bought *Pique-Bouffigue's field and spring, up there at Romarins? Is the spring still flowing? I heard my father say it was dead.
Three days. My Lords. My Lords, this is a list of our commands. We wish first for you to call a Parliament to repeal the laws relating to the branding of unfortunates forced into beggary. Instead, two, we command the return of all the lands and properties, which our uncle liberated from the monasteries, for the use and cultivation of the common people...in perpetuity. And third, we wish a school to be endowed.
I'm faking it. I'm Michelle Wilson. Call me Mishi. Often we have problems with our monitors. See that bouncing black bar? It helps when you go like that.
She thought the Big Bopper was a hamburger. - Who are all the flowers from? - Everyone. Maddy and Arthur, Carol and Walter Richard Norvik. And here's a book by that guy in high school, Michael Fitzsimmons. He dedicated it to you.
It's my idea. What do you think? I'll let you know when it's over. We're ready. 3rd District, Sergeant Washington. You've got a bomb inside the building.
Charlie, I got it. I got your wallet. You got my wallet? It fell out of your jacket and I picked it up. - Why didn't you tell me? - I'm telling you now.
An unknown form of energy of great power and intelligence, unaware that its transmissions are disruptive. I find it illogical that its intentions be hostile. You think this is its way of saying, "Hi, there!" to Earth? Only human arrogance would assume the message must be meant for man. You're suggesting the transmission is meant for a life form other than man? It is a possibility.
Both my parents died, but they left me the house and the fields, so I was getting by alone. The guys with dark glasses kidnapped you? That guy was one of them? Who can they be, calling in the army? Dola and the other guys, they all want the stone. But I had no idea it had mysterious powers.
Would you like another? - I'll buy. - Well, that's damn nice of you, pal. Don't mind if I do. - Don't you love this music? - Who doesn't?
It's okay. Everything's perfectly all right. Thank you. Listen, Harley, Lewis sold you an old shredder, a garden mulcher. I want to get it back. I want to use it like you did.
You ought to do something about that cold, Belker. - You'll infect half the office. - Oh, it's hay fever. And you ought to get rid of that plant too. It's dead. - It's dormant.
- You'll infect half the office. - Oh, it's hay fever. And you ought to get rid of that plant too. It's dead. - It's dormant. - Well, then it died in its sleep.
Why do I get the feeling you were expecting us? I'm sorry... MacGyver. My plan covered every contingency, and, as you can see, it has all paid off. Hasn't it? Congratulations... comrade. I've boxed the Dragon for transport.
We'll get the readings soon. If we're not holding the Ferengi, and they're not holding us, who is? The probe will give us some answers. Data, you were going to show us something. As requested, library computer information on this planet. It has been charted only from long-range scans.
Where's Steve? How long does it take to find a dress? It's not like he's going through his stuff. His stuff has to be all folded very carefully and neatly put away in his drawers, all color-coded like his stupid socks. Does Al have a sock drawer? Yeah.
He killed our dog! You're in luck, it missed the bone. Where's the captain? - Don't move! - I want to see him now! You stole our dog!
What's your pleasure, Mr. Cotton? The box. Take it, it's yours.
Honey, we're gonna be in life magazine! Before. After. You and your lovely wife might've been asking yourself, "exactly what are the benefits of aluminum siding." It won't chip, peel, blister, crack, flake, or rust in any way. Only maintenance you'll ever have is to wash it down twice a year with a hose.
It radiated such energy that it dazzled me. Then I could see only shadows. Then I could see only shadows. So I left the country, blind. Only your mother knows my story. Now that you have come to me, I entrust the Korê wing to you.
What are you doing? Writing home. The shortest letter to home is... a moan. DAW What do you need that worm for? Does it bite?
DAW What do you need that worm for? Does it bite? It's not that dangerous when it bites, but it will poke. Does it hurt? Listen.
He just wanted to talk to them about his friend. Jack, we'll never forget this. We owe you one! We owe you, too, Rashid. Oh, no, please, it was nothing. I did it with mirrors. Speaking of which, Jack, I put Lewis' mirror into the vault.
He was dead when I found him. He was with a nun. And... you have this nun? Si. And anAmericano, possibly a spy. A member of the Phoenix Foundation. I know this organization.
Your voice will now activate third-level clearance. What does that mean? You may ask any questions you wish. Thank you. Duana, what does the Custodian do? It frees us from burden, takes care of our needs.
- That's not fair! What's that on your finger? No! Not on your ring finger. It fits! Yes.
Neither was I. I just wanted a minute to think. I'm scared, Paul. I just can't wait to talk to that cemetery custodian. What do you hope to learn? I don't know. I just can't get that doll out of my mind. I saw it.
Would you oblige me by opening your medical bag? Yes, of course. Though, I really don't see what possible-- Someone has been here. Excuse me. This bottle of digitalis, was it empty?
That's it. Something to do with roses? Roses, greenfly, spray, syringe! Syringe? While I was walking back down... I saw this little box. I picked it up, and inside was one of those hypodermic things.
Something to do with roses? Roses, greenfly, spray, syringe! Syringe? While I was walking back down... I saw this little box. I picked it up, and inside was one of those hypodermic things. To whom did it belong?
So, Linda, you told me you're working at a diner. Yes. You can drop by any time you want. All the free food you can eat. Yeah. I recommend the meat loaf. it's great.
Mum, have you seen my pink sweater? It's on the hamper, honey. I meant to talk to you about that. -Why did you do that? -What did I do? We had a little accident. What happened?
Don't rely on inspiration. It doesn't exist. What can I teach you, anyway? A sculpture takes time. You have to let it rest forget it... to better judge it. I know. I haven't finished it.
There's work to be done! - Where did you find the green clay? - Under my feet. In Paris, Monsieur. You got the head and neck right, but you avoided the body. The human body is a world that moves, that pulsates.
It was Frank and Julia. I don't know when, but... they must have been with each other. But there's more... There was the box. It was a puzzle box. And Frank must have solved it.
Here's a happy donor. Thank you so much. Well, just for the record, YOU left me. YOU had to go and get your head together. My head is just fine. Check it out!
-Bombyx mori-- -Forget it. It's bandaged. Okay now? Must repair wiring to memory. My memory is me.
I could use a love potion on her! Franjean! Hey! Give me that dust of broken heart. Come on! Give it to me!
Franjean! Hey! Give me that dust of broken heart. Come on! Give it to me! It's very dangerous.
She's got my box! She's invisible! What are we going to do? We're going to find her. Where's your box? I haven't got it.
White Cloud. Hear me, O spirits of my ancestors. Give me a vision that I may know the truth I seek. How's the patient in 5A doing? He's going to be fine. That new technique I used for sealing him up is terrific.
- She said: [MUMBLING INDISTINCTLY] Take that apple out of your mouth. Now, what you did you say? I said, don't pull that apple out of my mouth, my loose tooth is stuck. Not anymore.
[MUMBLING INDISTINCTLY] Take that apple out of your mouth. Now, what you did you say? I said, don't pull that apple out of my mouth, my loose tooth is stuck. Not anymore. It's in this apple.
- I thank to have come, Poirot. - Of all. I wait for them to myself what values while having when an urgent promise was canceled. - Had you had to? - Do not doubt. The dead woman is called a Mrs. Allen.
It had some friend or friends closer men? It was that he gets engaged to return marrying, if that responds to his question. What the name of the man is with whom does it link was he going to marry? - My God, the Charles did not say to. - The one who is it Chatter? The fiance, Charles Loverton-West.
In the second one at night, you. Allen had a sight. A 45-year-old man, military type, moustache to the little brush, quite dressed and guiding a Standard Swallow. Does he know who is? He seems to be Major Eustace. - Who is Major Eustace? - To Pipe it knew it in India.
My God! All I could think of was getting away, Monsieur Poirot. I saw the lights of this house in the darkness and I just kept on running, until I got here. It must have been a great shock, mademoiselle. But tell me... The window where you found the body; it was in the back of the library, overlooking the garden, yes? Yes. How was the curtain of this window?
That is the big question, mon ami. What about the missing bridge card? It is in my pocket. I don't understand. Well, there is no great mystery. The missing card was in the box all the time.
I'm sorry if I startled you. Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of the Enterprise. I have brought you something you will need if you're going to stay on Rana IV. A matter replicator. - It has limited capabilities. - We have no use for such a thing.
I don't understand. I've inhibited almost all activity in the neocortex. She continues as if she is hearing the music. We have to shield her from all outside stimuli by inducing coma. I have a positive identification. It is the vessel that attacked us.
The answer, I believe, Doctor. The Lantree was not the source of the disease but it was the trigger. Trigger? The Lantree's First Officer exposed your children to Thelusian flu for the first time. Their active immune systems set out to attack the virus and once it was triggered, it kept going. But the antibody created an unexpected side effect.
No one has ever performed the Klingon tea ceremony for me. - There. That should do it. - You know the ceremony? I understand the externals, not the mysteries. I'm not a Klingon. Do not drink the tea.
And the totally excellent music. They worshipped us there, Rufus. - I know. That's why I was sent to make sure you passed your history report. If you guys were separated, it would have been disastrous. Your music will help put an end to war and poverty.
- Fay? - Yup. - I've been thinking about tomorrow. - Oh, yeah? There's a place up in Maine. I used to work in insurance, i found it.
...between the second and fourth slots. When you've done that with one of these stickers, it goes on the folder. Each file folder needs to go into its own Pendaflex folder, the appropriate one. Why does it have to be on the inside and outside folders? The case number?
- Kitzmiller. Oh, that's right. What are you gonna do with the mattress? I don't know, chuck it? Oh, wait, no, no, no. I'll take it.
- Leslie? - Lieutenant. Well, how may I help you, Lieutenant? I understand that you are in charge of the remains from the night of the massacre? Yes, but it's my understanding that the case is closed. Not to me.
It was empty. Can he present to proof "D"? Is the bottle this? Yes, man. - Did it tell to examine the bottle? - I was in charge.
Tell him to be ready to leave. She had a case on her computer we can't account for. It was logged in as a B file. Nobody knows where it came from. Nobody knows where it went. Where the hell is my speech?
Look at this wonderful frog! Where'd you get it? Down by the river.
It's all that ghost's fault Don't hug it. Put it down How did this person die so pitifully? I'd say this an evil ghost The odor is very strong It's back!
Uh, Mr. Zamora, I'm in the middle of shipping you hundreds of AK-47 s, grenade launchers, sniper rifles. Yes, you are, and I'm asking you to add one more gun to that order. Is that too much to ask? No, no, no, of course not. Uh, ahem, who am I supposed to get it from? They arrested a young man for the shooting.
There was a tray with a bowl of gruel on it, in the kitchen table. One moment, Mr. Radnor. This tin that Mr. Pengelley was replacing... Can tell us what was in it? No. Can you describe it to us? It was a bit bigger than a cocoa tin.
They were willing to sacrifice that and everything else, for their cause. You know, Hastings, the worst kind of fanatic, is the quiet unobtrusive fanatic. And the worst kind of customer is the customer who can't keep still. Monsieur Fingler, this jacket is too tight. - Oh! It is too tight, is it? - Yes. I shall scarcely manage to button it up.
What? I'm aware of the legend. It tells of a visitor... from the future... who left behind a mysterious device, the Tox Uthat. Essentially that story is correct. Then the Uthat actually exists? Yes.
- Mr. Crusher? - Engage... - Data to bridge. Stand by. Stand by, all stations. I am trying to penetrate the Borg regenerative subcommand path.
- Almost every wish. This is unacceptable. I have no desire to remain here. Even if I did, my Starfleet duties would not allow it. It's so... single-minded, isn't it? Very persistent.
It's bad for the brain paths in the long term. I fail to understand the value of my presence. Look around. There are items here gathered from half the galaxy. Right here. This is the very first Basotile ever created. Sorry.
My pleasure. Holy smoke. Flesh World again. Yeah. Harry, remember that ad with the picture of Ronette Pulaski? We traced that ad.
All right! - I don't drive. - You'd never know. Hey, look out behind you! Farewell, my darling! All I wanted was a '76 GLE.
MY FATHER'S GLORY I was born in the town of Aubagne at the foot of the goat-capped Garlaban in the days of the last goatherds. The Garlaban is a towering mass of blue rock.
I think it's a .357 Magnum. Really? I got a deuce-deuce. My brother gave it to me before he went to jail. I got it under my bed. Want to see?
You know what the main thing I felt was? Dumb. I even introduced them. I lent them money. I gave her my old television. They're probably watching it right now.
Perkell Heating and Cooling brings you He Said, She Said. Your commentators, Lorraine Bryer and Dan Hanson. The issue today, Proposition 41, the highway merger. Good afternoon, Dan. Proposition 41, on the ballot in October, would provide for a new connecting spur to merge Highways 710 and 88. In my view, this merger is long overdue.
Your cup. Your goddamned cup. So have you heard from Linda? You know, or you wouldn't ask. Did you read her letter? No.
But if there is a reason for a joke, I like to smile. Even your Aunt Hedwig. True Happiness comes from the heart. We are cheerful and are happy together. I am happy for your pretty pendant. Yes, mother has worn it for a long time. Too bad.
I'm sorry. You wanna come back over there and sit down? I wanna give you something. I'm fine right here. I wanna give you something. Give it to me here. Here.
You're a good friend. Well, she's the only hope her people have. Oh, no. It's gone. The car's gone. It was sitting right here on this first track. The maintenance men said they'd be workin' on it for weeks.
Yeah. Yeah. Come here, take a look at this. Bitter Flats is part of the reservation. This map was drawn up in 1894, according to the treaty. Black Stream is east of Bitter Flats, not west. Yeah. Now, take a look at this map that Willis faxed to me.

He's a shoe salesman. Really? In my country, shoe salesmen are laughed at by beggars and the feeble. Our countries are very much alike. Do we have a deal? Well, I am very touched by your offer and by your friend's insanity but to my family, this desk is a symbol of America.
Hastings, we will go to the wings. - Pardon? - Immediatement. Notice the perfection of the line, and rhythm of movement: " of end-week " it combines a dress radiant of white "crepe" pearl... S'il vous plait, we look the Mademoiselle Molly Dean. It links already if it dispatched.
I have a grown daughter. She has a small son of her own. Then you're married. My wife died quite some years ago. One thing I don't understand. If your people have known for generations their sun is dying, why not simply evacuate the planet?
- ...has anyone seen my grandson? - Let him be! See that camera? Take it without anyone seeing you. Hide it. Steal it?
Do not be fooled by its commonplace appearance. Like so many things, it is not what is outside, but what is inside that counts. This is no ordinary lamp. It once changed the course of a young man's life. A young man who, like this lamp, was more than what he seemed. A diamond in the rough. Perhaps you would like to hear the tale?
Yeah, I did a lot... well, some acid in the '60s. - See, I was at a... - (fly buzzes) I was at a Doobie Brothers concert. And I could see the music flowing in. It was flowing into me.
MAN BITES DOG (IT HAPPENED I N YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD) I've just finished ballasting the corpse, see? That means you fill it with certain things because... You may not be aware that a corpse under water swells up with air, see? So it tends to float to the surface.
Up there by the skylight. Look, Remy. Look, Patrick! It's a pair. It's mating season. Look at this feather.
Neitherwill talk. Let's go. You're a lunatic! I'll show you a shortcut! Oh, God! Oh, God!
You're buildin' a rat ship here, a vessel for seagoing' snitches. And if you think you're preparing' these minnows for manhood, you better think again, because I say you are killin' the very spirit this institution proclaims it instills. What a sham. What kind of a show are you guys putting' on here today? The only class in this act is sittin' next to me. And I'm here to tell you this boy's soul is intact.
You go on ahead. Manny'll drive you to your dorm. Come by before you go home for Christmas. We'll have a little cheer. And if you like, stay for dinner. Sometimes she cooks a pot roast.
That's not important, is it? What's really important is that none of this ever happened. This box doesn't exist. I never saw it before. Remember that. Bishop?
It's clear. What the hell...? I'll put it to you in plain English. It is so simple. Hammer that rod into place. Weld it over the bowplane.
For if the head is man's noblest appendage - it is the most unpleasant part of a trout. Two heads... This trout is bicephalic, a word coming from the Greek - and meaning... precisely this. However, I harbor no regrets about eating this phenomenon. The sauce was excellent. True.
Who wrote that one? Gershwin? Hit me, Irv. Okay. Well, then, we'll do this song. I'm sure you'll all enjoy it.
Honey, it'll be okay. We could steal a newspaper and use their TV section. Are you insane? It's not the same. Does a newspaper fit snugly in your hands? Does it jeer?
Marriage leads to everything bad in life: Work, kids, Habib shirts. You understand what I mean? Tell your friends. What, is my foot invisible? How can you miss it?
Bunch of old, useless garbage! I say it's old. It can't handle the interface of your converter. This equipment was designed for a different era. Now it's a piece of junk. I don't know.
Yeah. And it had a rectangular shape. Computer, show me a rectangular conference table. It's too high. Computer, reduce the height of the table by 25 percent. The table was smaller.
Stand down phasers, Mr Worf. In the meantime, take us out of range. Thrusters only, 100kph, nice and easy. - Aye, sir. - Data? The probe is moving with us, holding relative position.
- Do you understand that colony? I understand that these are human beings with free will. She has the right to leave. What happens to the colony if others join her? The society is genetically integrated. There would be gaps.
I characterize the unit's performance as excellent. I hope Cmdr La Forge and Capt Picard agree. I am confident they will. Cmdr La Forge is especially... It didn't finish sealing the plasma conduit. Let me send it back in.
Well, apparently Count Olenski takes a similarly modern view. I never heard of him lifting a finger to get his wife back. Three days later, the unthinkable happened. Mrs. Manson Mingott sent out invitations summoning everyone to a formal dinner. Such an occasion demanded the most careful consideration. It required the appropriate plate.
I thought I'd call but their house seems empty. It is empty. They're all at the party. Everyone's there but me with my fever and Countess Olenska. You found my parasol! It's my best one.
Not out, exactly. It's more like a way through. It's a long shot, but it's... Well, it's legal. I know it's weird, but if we follow the law, it just might save us. You don't want to hear the plan.
- I can't. Just call it a hunch. - Ignore your psychic abilities. All posts take to your positions. - You've got a fever, Frank. - You stay alert in there, will you? One quality above all marks this President.
- This is it. - This is where we were. I know. And I was sitting there after you left, having some wine. - I looked out and saw... - You saw her after I left? I saw her on a bus.
Got a cold. Hello? –Is anyone here? –I'm here. The door was unlocked. I didn't bust in.
Come here. That's a boy. Come on. Okay. Easy does it. Come on! You don't want to startle it.
As my accountant, tell me, should I be alarmed that the auditors are reviewing my books? - Or have you done your job properly? - You needn't be alarmed. I needn't be alarmed! -I'm sorry, sir. -Do you know how much this saddle is worth?
- What'll hurt you? My resemblance to Liv Ullmann. She won the all-state competition for comedy and drama. Really? My gosh! The quality of mercy is not strained.
You were running like crazy. Are you crying? It is the water. - You don't wear underwear? - Never. I borrowed the cat from the neighbour, to kill the mice.
Afternoon, Sister. -Good afternoon. -Don't miss the gators. Thank you. We're going to see the gators, girls. Stand back, everybody. I've got her medication. Here it is, darling.
Dr Scully, can you ID these marks? Needle punctures, maybe. An animal bite. Electrocution of some kind. How's your chemistry? This substance was found in the surrounding tissue.
[CAR HORN HONKING] The classic form of attack must include these four weapons. The first is the staff a symbol of strength, yet flexibility. The second is the staff divided into three sections symbolizing the body, mind and spirit. The butterfly knives represent the penetration of the flesh the cutting away of all negativity in one's life. The steel whip is like water.
This is better than the last parade, you remember? [FIREWORKS POPPING, PEOPLE CHATTERING] - Bandits. - Yes. The dragon has a wing. You cannot see it.
JENNY: Keep away from me. Jenny, I'm your protector. We two alone will sing like birds in the cage. When thou dost ask me blessing I'll kneel down and ask of thee forgiveness so we'll live and pray and sing and tell old tales and take upon us the mystery of things as if we were God's spies. See, Lear understood the world was decaying around him.
Police are calling it a hit-and-run. Probably a drunk driver. But we're not buying that, right? I was there. It was no ordinary hit-and-run. The car was coming straight at him.
But do you really think that I wouldn't have a plan? Sorry. What is the plan? To not have this unpleasantness find its way to my doorstep. What about my doorstep? It's already passed your doorstep.
The Vulcans were using a primitive device. We've developed far better ways of controlling the flux density. We should be able to contain the reaction this time. If we can't, we destroy the whole Bajoran system. Major, the rupture is already expanding. We seal it or it destroys the system anyway.
It seems like years since I've seen "OK". I was sitting here thinking, last year at this time, I was fighting the Cardassians in some nameless swamp. And if you'd told me that just one year later, they'd be gone, I'd be wearing this uniform, up here in charge of protecting some wormhole... Protecting your Celestial Temple. I envied Vedek Winn because she was a true believer. I wanted my faith to be as strong as hers.
- I don't know. When I was small, there was a tree right outside my window. It was the ugliest, most gnarled old tree I'd ever seen. - Even the birds stayed away from it. - But you loved it? Hated it.
I'm not nearly as understanding as Curzon was. Yes, sir. Commander, can I talk to you? - It's about the computer. - Still giving you problems? No, it's not.
- I've got a way out of here. I'm willing to forget what happened back there, and take you with me. We don't need anyone else. We're brothers! I'll give you the chip our father made. It contains much more than just emotions.
- He could be leading us into a trap. - No, that is not so. It would be risky to set a trap here, so close to Federation space. But the fact remains, here we are, there is no freighter. What else did your contact tell you? The freighter is an old Antares-class vessel with limited speed and range.
We'd leave my mother and her crew stranded. - Commander... - I've been thinking about this. A few weeks ago, I got a message from my mother. She said her new chief engineer had been experimenting with a warp drive. Now, I've seen the Hera.
Boost the confinement beam, please. Pattern lock established. Energizing. Bravo! Do you have the chair, Commander? No.
The victim's. 105 inches from the fireplace. The victim is a Thomas Werner, single, white... It's Tooms. And he took something. Baltimore PD checked out Tooms's apartment.
I don't want to fly! Come on! It's just like a roller coaster. I hate roller coasters! I want to go down! The entrance is down an old well. Over there.
Loser! Why don't you learn how to drive, pal? You wanna play? Damn it! That stone could've come from anywhere. It could've come from a necklace or a pendant, an earring.
Very nice, Ange. You are right. You're always right. But then if I didn't run, we wouldn't be here. I sure wouldn't mind sitting down. # For the kill # Tina got me this job.
Even though I was new... the squire and John trusted me to get them safely back from town... no matter how terrible the storm. The wild branches tried to grab me. The rain stung my eyes like a thousand bees! Keep moving, Beauty! BLACK BEAUTY: The bridge was flooded.
Yes, you're right. I want to get rid of him. I've dreamed it hundred times. Every night. All night long. I bought a gun. Where is it?
Dan! Dan! Dan! We can't stay here! The car! Is it running?
If I know her as well as I think I do, she'll invite us in for tea and strumpets. Good plan. Where does she live? I don't know. What's her last name? I'll look it up. LLOYD: You know, I don't really recall.
What kind of cough? Was it dry or, you know, liquidy? I mean... It was just a cough, sir. Next time I'll save you a sample. He'll really like the bird, I think.
I love it, so what? Waiter Yes I've heard that the bean cube pudding is famous here Sure It stinks!
Carbon monoxide poisoning but you're sedated by the pills. The plastic bag protects you from well-meaning rescuers. Make sure your environment is the way you want it before you put the bag on Think about music. It makes the crossing into our new existence so much easier. Death isn't an end.
It'll be free for you then. Not on the mouth! My father left me a hunting book. I heard René le Florentin might like it. Is it for sale? Because I was robbed.
Oh, Jesus! Oh, God! I hit the baby! Oh, God! I just hit the baby! Cans! There was no baby.
Shit! - Bull's-eye! - Great. OK, I want you to clip on the battery and then run it to the lead wire. Copy. I can't bypass.
I know. If I could.... If I could have just a moment. You will take care of him? I have few days left to me, but I will watch him until the end. We should know very soon if the machine has truly accepted him.
You make this so easy. Even before that, as a youngster, I used to build model cranes. And I ended up with quite an eclectic collection. Marv, you wanna come in and get a closer look at all this? Now, I have to say I'm especially proud of my first crane. I spent the better part of sixth grade crafting it.
Well, that would be really nice, because... it's been my fantasy to be with a man who enjoyed doing the same things I do. You know, like taking me to the opera, the ballet, the theater. That's my fantasy too. - Really? - Mm-hm. If I could find that man, I wouldn't have to go myself. What is your real fantasy?
- Why? - I dropped the chip. Oh, you dropped the chip. Can you see the chip? No. Victor, that little chip is worth well over $ 100,000.
I hope you don't mind. See, Superman saved me from this building the sound guy blew up and even though I'm not a reporter I thought I'd write down a few paragraphs, show the chief but I can finish it someplace else. Yeah. Let me get out of your way. Okay? Yeah. Hey, you're wearing the receiver for my spy pen.
Chocolate? Honey, it's in the catalogue that she sent me. What catalogue, Peg? It's called X.X.L.L. Bean. And I put it with the mail. Where is the mail, Gracie?
McCheese. Okay, you're in trouble now, buddy. I voted for him. And they say you can't fight city hall. - Where'd you get that apple? - Oh, it was in my yard.
Well, how could that possibly be? Well, what about the commercial? - There's not gonna be a commercial. - Why? I've got a zit. Look at it, Daddy.
They crashed in the Andaman Sea off Burma. [bleeping] That's why I'm calling you. That'll take us 10 hours to get there. Why don't you send some jet copters? The capsule sank on impact. We don't know exactly where or how deep... but we have reason to believe that some of them are still alive. [beeping] A signal buoy... popped to the surface 10 minutes ago.
Last dry dock all galley vents were routed to refrigeration. How the hell do you know that? Studied up for my Officer Review. Hey, buddy. I'm through! UEO central computer recognized our inquiry.
(INTERCOM BEEPING) FORD: Captain, the WSKRS are picking up some movement ahead of us. We'll talk later. If we're still alive. Status? It looks like the Marauder is reversing course, as though it were hunting us. In my program, as I remember it, they should be launching a missile about 1800 hours.
We'll talk later. If we're still alive. Status? It looks like the Marauder is reversing course, as though it were hunting us. In my program, as I remember it, they should be launching a missile about 1800 hours. It's afraid we'll find it before then.
It led us right into it. I've never seen anybody risk that before. I have. I used that in the Aegean campaign. I forgot it, but it remembered. And now?
I can't. And it would take days. We'd have to evacuate the station. The only other thing I can come up with is a directional sonic generator. I can adjust it to a frequency uncomfortable to them, drive them out. But that's too slow.
- Can you deal me in? - Sorry. It's a two-man game. Get your hand off that. Is that why you killed the engineer? To get this brick? I had to get it back.
Why do you say that? Because the end result was unknown. The object could have been dangerous. It may in fact be dangerous. And I have allowed it to go off on its merry way. Yes, sir. The intelligence that was formed didn't just come out of the ship's systems.
What for? The man there says he has Molor's head in a box. The real Molor. That is impossible. The real Molor died centuries ago. I know.
I'm Ned Quint. I took care of your grandmother's house. Nana never mentioned you. There's lots she didnae talk about. Let me get rid of that candle. Why?
We could charge big fines for trespassing or for spitting on the street. It could beat beavering as a way to get rich. What's gonna draw people? Your good looks or my sunny disposition? Darling Janey, This bitter cold is something. I had to put the ink in the coffee pot to thaw it.
I'll have you know I have the reflexes of a cat. And the speed of a mongoose. Throw it! I dare you! Ouda, don't just stand there. Throw me a spear! It's in the bone!
Her name's Rosanna. Why Rosanna? - She had such a beautiful nature. - I can't take it anymore. - Really? The fear's too much for a duck.
Whose house is that? It's abandoned. No one comes here any more. The guy who had this place, he gave up a long time ago. Look. You see this earth?
And if Godzilla's chasing Junior... that means he's heading that way. Excuse me, sir. I've got news from the US G Control Center. It doesn't look too good. They have the latest readouts from the satellites. It seems Godzilla's temperature is rising.
Okay. Steven. You like that name? Yeah, I think it suits you. It's okay? I won't let anything happen to you. This force, this thing ... that lived inside of him ... came from a source ... too violent ... too deadly for you to imagine.
Can anyone tell me what's going on? I'd Iike to know. Why? Don't ask. That's how it is. Sir, I fear the road leads nowhere.
You just don"t have a clue about what brought you here, do you? You"d fight for any son of a bitch if he convinced you you were right. - Someone convinced you. - Not someone, something. The Alliance was formed to support you. You"re right, Jefferson.
Mademoiselle... Mademoiselle Sally, you are on the terms amicable with the other students? Some of them. I've just had a vacation with Len Bateson. A week in Amsterdam. This was before the rucksack was stolen?
-What's that? -What? Nothing! -I saw my name. What is it? -No, no, see? See?
I had to call ya. I knew he wasn't giving the notes I sent home. What notes? l-l-l was going to give them to you tomorrow. You have to lean out of a castle to kiss the Blarney stone? Weren't you scared? Hey, after raising five boys by myself, nothing scares me. Well, why do you kiss the Blarney stone, anyway?
Come on, Superman. You wanna get crazy, huh? Come on. What the...? The power. He cannot control it.
STAR Labs has a subzero chamber there. That's where they store the virus. So how do we get to it? There's an air vent that leads directly to the chamber. Exactly what makes this virus so special? It's airborne.
Hurry it up. Sonya's gonna kill me. - What is this place? - A Sanctuary District. 21 st century history is not one of my strong points. Too depressing.
There's a strange phase variance in the radiation stream. - We'll have to wait till the probe exits. - That shouldn't take long. Captain, I'm getting a distorted energy reading. The probe's telemetry has changed. It's stuck.
So far, our sensors have detected four separate scans of the microprobe, each on a progressively narrower band. Someone is interested in that probe. There may be a entity within the wormhole, curious about an intruder. Our probe would have detected that. - What's the condition of the probe? - I've been monitoring it.
Soon they'll both be toast. They can hear his bloody leg dragging on the floor. The mutant is on their trail, hungry for the taste of young meat. - What's it look like? - Yeah, what? Do you really wanna know?
The boys have a gift for you. You asked for them during your worst fevers. During my fever, I... I left here and travelled to a place. This place. You carry it with you.
My feet hurt. I need a moment's rest. Sorry. I splashed you. I spoke to your mother about the veil. She told me. Get used to wearing it, my child.
Dallas Grimes. Wife of Muddy Grimes. You run an arms smuggling ring. You got my bad side. Three days ago you pulled a job at the Army Research Facility. You stole the X-5 unit. You had it with you when you checked in.
Why are you kicking me? I can't see a damn thing! - Die! - Jesus! I think I nailed it. I don't believe it!
Who the hell are you? Park ranger. Just put it down and I won't have to kill you. This isn't a standoff. I've got the gun. I never keep it loaded.
The world is speeding up too fast now, Eddie. - We can barely hold on as it is. - You're right, it's not working. That's why we've got to try something else. Not bury the technology, but let it out. You let it out, but you let it out at a pace the world can absorb.
You're alive. And I'll keep you that way. Your hand. There's a first-aid kit under your seat. That weapon, or whatever it was was from your company, wasn't it? It's an E.M. prototype.
- You had to be hard-headed. - Absolutely. She looks for me at the library. A so-called friend tells her where I am. Next thing I know, here she comes across the track where tryouts are with this big, thick leather belt. It was so thick no one could wear it.
I don't like to talk about them, if it's all the same to you. There are some on your neck as well. They look almost like teeth marks. That's-- Yes, sir. That's what they are. Mary, you'll find an eel in the fish pantry. Fetch it in, will you?
-One more thing. -I can't wait. It's simple. No one knows who fed you this information. And I mean nobody. How did you get it?
You look like someone who's been breathing in the air of Picasso's studio. Peculiar air. Sometimes it seems like poison gas, but then you find you can't breathe in any other. That is not at all the case with francoise. I don't like cats, but when my dog died, he gave me a cat. I still have it.
We're most proud to add you to our ranks. Welcome, Lothar. It's the famous Krupp 88. It's almost a shame that there are no planes to fire them at. Fire. A tank is deaf and half-blind. You can hear it, but it can't hear you. It's hard for you to see it all because of the way it jolts up and down.
Huh? Doesn't it look like someone's face? A face? This rock is limestone. It's smooth and pretty, just like a movie star. This one is quartz.
I'm not trying to create a market. I'm looking for a weapon that can be smuggled in, concealed easily and used to strike at our enemies, learn their secrets, perhaps even... - ...destroy them from the inside. - Whatever. One warning: This stuff is made primarily for humans.
You stand for nothing but your own petty interests. "The problems of others are not our concern." I do not blame you for standing silent in your shame. You, who knew what was coming, but refused to take up the burden of this war. If the warrior caste will not fight, then the rest of us will. The Council has lost its way.
You forget yourself, Mollari. It's an unhealthy mistake. - What have you done? - What have I done? I've done nothing. I've given them the island of Celini.
- This is my private place. I come here to think, to dream, to plan for my eventual godhood and to play. Very few who come in here ever leave again. You should feel honored. The electro-whip is set to give an increasing level of pain each time it is used. At 40 strokes, it will kill even a Narn.
The Babylon Project was our last, best hope for peace. It failed. But in the year of the Shadow War, it became something greater our last, best hope for victory. The year is 2260. The place, Babylon 5. I have checked the data records of the great machine running the planet below.
Okay. Okay. You know what? I think you're very funny. Kudos on that hat joke. Ha, ha. But come on, guys, just give him back the hat. Why should we?
All right. Well, Sammy, where would you like to begin? With the obvious, Al. The front door. I'll step outside. You lock it up.
And you say... "Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, which..." Now, stop right there, Juliet. Can you tell me the significance of that line? That I actually remembered it. All right!
- Honey, don't panic. Don't panic. Don't panic. Yes, don't panic. Has the bullet I supposedly fired turned up? No.
I believed in it so much I had to lead a double life. But what would you know about that? - He's radioactive. - What? Jimmy. I gave him my card.
Okay. To the point. If Superman wasn't able to save the space station the main thrusters were programmed to stop and the altitude thrusters would've fired anyway. The space station would've saved itself. So you mean there was never any real danger? - Exactly.
- Cool. I wanna stay. Is that the bomb? It's not here. "If you're reading this, I assume you got my message. Here's the location of the real bomb.
Beep Lois and Clark to meet me at the house they went to this morning. I wanna see if there's any clues they might've overlooked. You got it. I'll never get used to that. The bomb almost exploded. Correction.
Report! It sent a plasma burst along the tachyon beam into our main power system. We've got EPS relays burned out all over the ship. I'm not getting any response from the warp or impulse drives. Even the maneuvering thrusters are out! The missile was not significantly damaged.
I may have more questions for you later. Med Lab to Lieutenant Tuvok. Go ahead, Doctor. I think I've found something that will help you. Do you see the DNA strands on the lower border? Yes. They were retrieved from inside the head wound by nanites that I designed to recognize unusual DNA patterns. This DNA was isolated because it didn't belong to the victim.
Mary! You can't yell. Understand? If you stopped thinking, so much about poetry... you'd make your father happier and you'd make more money than him. That's right, Oreste. That's what I tell him too. What a nice hat. How does it look? - Nice.

Ain't it cool? Oh, right, rub my nose in it, why don't you? $10 million design, and now those militia nutjobs get to keep their cash. So fucking unfair. That bomb you built does deserve an audience. It's a work of art.
More! A bit more! More, I said! Look. What a big bell! Look at the size of it!
What are they doing to these people? I don't know. I don't know either. Here. Take my own mezuza in that tree of yours up there. Keep it with you at all times.
Maximilian! Hey, how you doing, creep? Good. Me too, except my arm has been bothering me. Oh, no, Dad! Oh, yeah.
I remember the people who help me. There's a job for you in San Diego, if you want it. I've spent enough time in the company of death. Fifteen years ago, John Hammond had a dream. Like John himself, the dream was grand. It was outsized. It was bold.
There's a job for you in San Diego, if you want it. I've spent enough time in the company of death. Fifteen years ago, John Hammond had a dream. Like John himself, the dream was grand. It was outsized. It was bold. It was impractical.
Farewell. - Ashitaka. - Kaya, you can't be here. I don't care. Remember me with this. Your jewel dagger.
I'll miss you. There are so many beautiful and remarkable things here. Yes. When I was a child, I would come to this park and play. Do you know why the bamboo is here? It is waiting for the wind to touch it.
-You got a better idea? I might. [GRUNTS] COGLIOSTRO: You see, you've been using your armor only by reflex. You must learn to control it.
T minus three minutes and counting. You're too late again, Mr. Bond. It's a bad habit of yours. There's nothing you can do. T minus two minutes and counting. The missile's fully programmed.
Now hold on a minute. Froget what our culture has made of the Djinn. Forget Barbars Eden. Forget Robin Williams. To the peoples of ancient Arabia, the Djinn was not cute nor funny. It was something else entirely.
Mogge, if you don´t do the whole sleep period, no 150 crowns! Christian, for God´s sake do something unexpected for once! quiet while GROUP Oh, sorry. You gave me a shock. That shock was very, very important.
- Well. - Mr. Paladin the Office of Information seems to have anything but. An internal investigation is being conducted. Great. Could you tell us the nature of the investigation? Certainly.
Stuck in a nowhere job. Passed up over and over again for promotion. Living a life of honesty. Did you get my machine out of the warehouse? Yes, sir. Yes, I dusted it off myself.
Hi, goys and birls. That's a good one, Krincess Pelly. Thanks, Duncle Udley. That's the joke, don't wear it out. Today's Puppet Land story is " Curious George Converts to Judaism. " " Curious George was crossing Delancey when the wind blew off his yarmulke into the gutter. "
Telling me she colors with her dead grandmother is a little more than sensitive. Come on. You know Jordan. She's got a gift. You can't suppress it. Your "gift" gave you a nervous breakdown. This "gift" makes you see horrible images.
Can we examine the body? Who loves ya, baby? Come on. It seems a Mongolian cluster flock has appeared. Dr Schlossburg's body is gone. It has been released.
- Better late than never! - You got that right! One child is dead. Another one is missing. Some of us know all too well the pain... of losing a child. I hope this tragedy can bring us all together.
Would you believe me if I said no? Actually, I'd have you strip searched. That might be fun. But in the interest of saving time... I've never seen a data crystal quite like this. Looks like it has a phase inverter embedded inside it. It's not going to be easy to decode.
I know. He'll be stuck with 28 million people and no way to kill them. I'm glad you're amused, Quark. Lucky for us I can get hold of some Varaxian LM-7. I can get hold of some Varaxian LM-7. Never heard of it. It's a new biogenic weapon still in the experimental stage.
I need you to contact the Council of Ministers. Tell them I need to meet with them immediately. As a Starfleet Captain or as the Emissary of the Prophets? Both. That'll get their attention. Remember the nonaggression pact the Dominion offered Bajor a few weeks ago? Yeah, they're still debating it in the Council of Ministers. It'll never pass.
No more lessons. I need to get into this building and I need to get into it now. That is not the way an apprentice should address her master. Maestro, your prince is going to come after us. The only escape is inside. Escape? We will be trapped inside. No. There is a wondrous invention inside this building.
You make no mistake about this. I won't allow members of my crew to be condemned for a crime they did not commit. This has gone too far. We have to go to Bahrat. We'll end up in his cryostatic prison for decades. Not if he agrees to my plan. Your plan is crazy.
Descriptions of bizarre images, almost like a record of her dreams. The hallucinations? Maybe so. Sometimes she's in a Borg vessel running...or hiding behind a bulkhead, falling down a shaft. Borg everywhere, chasing her. Nightmarish stuff. What about this...bird? She mentions it several times.
The hallucinations? Maybe so. Sometimes she's in a Borg vessel running...or hiding behind a bulkhead, falling down a shaft. Borg everywhere, chasing her. Nightmarish stuff. What about this...bird? She mentions it several times. It flies at her, shrieking.
I can't stop until I've restored Kyana Prime and forced time to give me back my wife. Maybe it isn't possible. When I tell you that time has moods... a disposition to be intuited... I'm not speaking metaphorically. What do you mean? Anger is one of its moods-- anger and the desire for... retribution, vengeance. Time itself has tried to punish me for my arrogance.
So, because he wasn't born on this planet, he doesn't have rights any more? Get out! Major! Argh! What happened? The Goa'uld has won.

- You smell like a toilet. - Maybe I could use your shower. But first a drink. Then I will do anything you say. I had him hooked up, rolling, 41/2... 3 minutes. That was my best time. I didn't see that dog in the back seat.
He looks like a fucking loser. Hey, at least I'm housebroken. Fucking time-waster. Thanks a lot, asshole. I'm throwing rocks tonight. Mark it, Dude. I'm telling you, this was a valued rug.
And she was so scared. And next I saw this truck coming around the turn. And it was honking, trying to get us to move. I tried to grab her reins and... to get her horse to move out of the way. And the truck started to skid. And there was no time to do anything.
And it was honking, trying to get us to move. I tried to grab her reins and... to get her horse to move out of the way. And the truck started to skid. And there was no time to do anything. It ran right into Judith, and... And she just disappeared.
I shall soon be cleaning the fireplace with Danielle! - Where is that girl? - Probably off catching rabbits with her teeth. Begging your pardon, my lady, but that mirror in your bedchamber did you move it? - Of course not. Why?
Do you admit that on the night of May 1st... you did willfully and consciously apply... the following forbidden paint colors... to the north wall of the Pleasantville police station... red, pink, vermilion, puce, chartreuse... umber, blue, aqua, oxblood, green, peach, crimson... yellow, olive, and magenta? Yeah, I do. Where's our lawyer? I think we want to keep these proceedings... as pleasant as possible. I don't think a lawyer will be necessary. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction... occurred in full public view where it was accessible to... and in plain sight of minor children?
Magic isn't just spells and potions. Your badge? It's just a star. Just another symbol. Your talisman. It can't stop criminals in their tracks can it?
Copy it. Copy it and send it for me. Carpy, you're gonna send it yourself. Put it down! - It's got blood! - I see it. Carpy, I see it.
And what was the basis for that determination? Carbon-based elements in the fossils... exist only in the Magellanic galaxy. That's 100 million light years away. Well, how did they get to Mars? By my reckoning... Mars was visited by an alien species... approximately one billion years ago. The species was like a plague, a cancer.
That would be too much to wish for. You're so confident. Only in bed. (rumbling) (car alarm) (Frank) It's a Broadway theatre.
You are A bottle. You and your record label. " Why would he then signed a contract with to make someone to whom he has not believed? He has heard your music and it is good.

Hey, Andrea. Hi. I need to talk with you. - I know. That night was Todd Sparrow his soul air. He spat.
- I know a cheat when I see one. - The man was a cheat. - If anything occurs to you, call me, will you? ' DO YOU gamble? The world breaks everyone. And afterwards, many are strong at the broken places.
He said wormhole-- a layman's term that... that covers any number of phenomena. I am familiar with a certain anomaly that could be categorized as an "interspatial flexure." Where is it? Actually, a better question would be: Where is it now? It's really quite interesting. The aperture of the phenomenon-- which I prefer to call an intermittent cyclical vortex-- is unfixed.
- Ally? - What? We're late. And please stop snapping at me! A pig liver transplant is experimental. Was the doctor appropriate in performing it?
I want you to get ahold of Stephen and G'Kar. Meet me in my quarters in one hour. I have something I wanna show you. And after that we're going to need you like we've never needed you before. Now, this catalog of various biologies will not be used for warfare, I assume. Now, why does everyone ask that?
I'll have my people there in plainclothes, but that's the best we can do. We still don't know who he is or how to stop him or... - Doc. - Yeah? Any of your people do anything to this link? No, not that I know of. Why?
It remained there by the river, long after I had gone to dust. If there was a straight answer buried in there somewhere, I sure didn't see it. It was a parable. The willow is deceptively strong. It bends, but it does not break. Its roots are deep and can withstand the worst storm.
- They bought us corsages? - I took the orchid. OK. I don't see what the big deal is. I'm not making a big deal. You wanted the orchid, you got the orchid. It goes with my complexion better.
- What did you guys do now? - Me? I didn't do anything. The pointer on the spirit board. It moved on its own. I'm serious.
I love destruction. Before you take out any wall, you want to make sure that it's non-load bearing. Simplest way to do that is check out your blueprints. This wall is non-load bearing, so we can rip it out. And the safest, quickest way, is using a claw hammer. And to handle our debris, we'll be using this trash chute.
Hurry back. Lew? Oh, God. Oh, God. Manson, Bundy, Dahmer. Their cases are all well known. But the case I'm about to describe is so horrific, it should never be discussed outside this room. It challenged every preconception. It followed no rules.
You do if they're Ferengi. Great! Another closet. We've chosen this spot for a reason. For one thing, it's a confined area with only two ways in or out: this one, and that one over there.
- This battle, is it to be fought here? Bajor will be reborn. Shabren's Fifth Prophecy. The rebirth. If the Evil One is destroyed, it will bring a thousand years of peace. The golden age of Bajor.
Captain's Log, supplemental. So far, the crew hasn't found any evidence to support my doubts about Arturis. Nevertheless, I've told them to keep looking and to keep their optimism in check. But that's one order I don't expect them to follow to the letter... Daily Log, Seven of Nine, Stardate 51981. 6. I've analyzed the quantum slipstream technology of the Dauntless.
What's amazing to me is that someone 100, 000 years ago was harvesting microsingularities. If nobody shows up to protest, I'd like to stay here for a while-- try to find the answers to some of these questions. This is the kind of archeological puzzle that's always fascinated me. Want a cup? No, thanks. You haven't mentioned your letter. Who was it from?
If it does, we're all in trouble. How many ships have you seen? Only one. Damaged. We tracked it across 50 light- years. We thought that we had killed the creature, but this prey is unlike any other.
When I was 16, I followed an ancient human custom. I took my father's shuttle out for a joyride and proceeded to fry all the relays. I'm guessing he wasn't happy about getting it back. Actually, he didn't. As far as I know, it's still at the bottom of Lake Tahoe. Here it is. The coaxial induction drive.
Hey, Sam. How's it going tonight? She's still the same. Janet said that the Goa'uld left after it died. That's right. Um...
We have the computer enhancement. There was an energy burst, coming from the bridge of one of the ships,... ..recorded at 1750 hours. Just before they stopped. That's it? For all we know, that flash could be part of their ship's normal function. Except that the burst came from within the ship.
Umm, this notion of living a 11,000 years entered my mind for a moment... and I couldn't... it's a lot to take in. Apparently, we've got time to adjust. We really do have all the same sensations and perceptions that we did in our human form. Well, if you think about it, the human body is just a machine. It's a vessel for our consciousness, I mean. It's just an organic one.
(Mulder) Come on. Get in the car, Scully. No more screwing' around. We need a name. Your real name. Invisigoth. You want my address?
I don't see that there's a damn thing you can do for me. You can break their backs with proof about this virus. - Proof that what you say it does is true. - I don't have that proof yet. Maybe I can give it to you. There's a file folder.
It's the question that drives us, Neo. It's the question that brought you here. You know the question just as I did. What is the Matrix? The answer is out there, Neo. It's looking for you.

- Thank you. I may have won a cruise! Oh, yes. Mikey! - Hi. Find the chopper? - Abandoned in Queens.
I hope your answer's no. I said "buy" too many times, right? Let's eat. You got no lunchroom here? Here's what we got. We got a gun that was used in a homicide. Killed someone.
You must be accompanied by a parent or guardian. - Why? - This movie has naughty language! Next, please. - This can't be happening. - We have to see it.
Louhela, take the girls with the wounded to Lieksa. You're to be gone by afternoon. Is that clear? -Quite clear. May I leave this letter with you? -Better send it from Lieksa.
There are no secrets at the countryside. There are no secrets [sounds like "hemmeligheder" in Danish] out here. Secrets [Hemmeligheder]? But there's a place here called "Hemmeligheder". - No! - Yes!
How much do you want? I don't know. lt's been a while. How much is an ounce? This is totally decent, and it's 300. This shit is top-of-the-line. It's called G-1 3. it's genetically engineered by the US government.
It's for the best. When I saw you two at the party the other night, you seemed perfectly happy. Call me crazy but it is my philosophy that in order to be successful, one must project an image of success at all times. What are you doing? I was filming this dead bird. Why?
-Hanne... -What is it? -Can't you come back? -Arvid... Remember when we had a cat? Why do you suppose it ran off?
Believe it or not, the secret to all this is actually imperfection. Imperfection? Things like wrinkles, less-than-perfect teeth. Details like fading scars, little pockmarks. Look at my nose. See my nose?

Just a few more laps to go. Casey is doing well. He's using all his best anecdotes, and Herbie now seems quite engaged in the conversation. - Felix is trying to get acknowledged. - Yeah, man. Fuckin' homegrown. Yeah, man, that homegrown shit's good, man.
No, I know them all. I want to apologise about this morning. Do you remember the first day when you asked if the car wasn't working? I answered, "lt's given up the ghost." Do you remember? That day, we were driving uphill. The car gave up the ghost. Yes.
My rose of Sharon, lily-of-the-valley... I haven't felt this good for a long time. Place me on your heart like a seal, like a signet ring on your hand. Wake up, lamet vav Pinches! Hear the Word of the Lord, Lord of the worlds whose anger was soothed by your prayers: The village of Polana will not be crushed by an iron rod, nor scattered like the desert sand.
Is it all there? Thank God! It's here! Be sure about yourself be fore you blame others. How can a purse drop off from a closed handbag? Even if it did, how did it get so far?
There was Borg stuff everywhere. Elaborate. I went on the mission-- the one my mom told me about, the Borg sphere-- but it didn't work. Everybody got assimilated. Nightmares are caused by irrational fear. They're not real. They can't damage you.
I think this is a summoning spell for something called... Gachnar? Well, yes. Somehow the beginning of the spell must've been triggered. Gachnar's trying to manifest itself to come into being. - How?
No, no, no, no, no, you can't bargain, Eric. We're in control here. Let's check again. Who's got the upper hand? Haven't you been paying attention? That gun won't do anything to us.

- How many times did you go? - Three or four. It started to work, you know. She said I had as much chance of being struck by lightning as I had of being bitten by a dog. So... what's the problem? Well, I was leaving the practice one day, feeling really well-adjusted and happy, and this fucking great Alsatlan came harlng down the road towards me, jaws slung with bloody slaver, eyes lit by the fires of Hades' eternal damned kingdom.
I'm talking about what we're gonna do now! Wanna go into your party? They were playing the Timewarp, I hate the Timewarp! - Daisy likes it. - So what? ! I hate it!
We linked. - I see. - There's nothing to worry about. He's not trying to lure me to the Dominion. The Link is part of what we are. It comes as naturally to us as talking does to humanoids.
Eminence, Anjohl is here. He claims you called for him. - Show him in. - As you wish. I remember when I first saw the gate of the Celestial Temple. I was on the Promenade.
You are obviously delusional. Allow me to repair your program. Now, why would I want you to do that? You of all people should understand. Being unfettered by ethical subroutines has made me far more efficient. Status? I'm going to extract her cortical array.
Bring me aboard. I can assist you. You've deactivated your com system? And reinforced the shielding in this section. We won't be overheard. I'd have more faith in your security precautions, if you weren't already at the mercy of this weapon. We didn't know what it was when we brought it aboard. This particular series has a class-1 1 intelligence factor.
And reinforced the shielding in this section. We won't be overheard. I'd have more faith in your security precautions, if you weren't already at the mercy of this weapon. We didn't know what it was when we brought it aboard. This particular series has a class-1 1 intelligence factor. It's warp-capable, fully armored, self-guiding. It has a maximum range of 80 light-years.
So we'll fly it to a closer planet with a Stargate. - Good thinking. - It happens. Well, this is the place. Yeah. How do you open that door?
- What is that? - It's an implant. I've seen this before. Yes. The drill... I remember the drill. I couldn't see it at first. That was the worst part.
Me, I'm starving. I could eat a whore. Yeah, much better. The last one tasted like bat's piss. You can just pour it. You can just pour it. - How are you doing on that appetizer? I'm eating it.
- What wouldn't make him suspicious? - That I needed him urgently. Destitute. In serious trouble, the kind I couldn't sort out myself. Serious trouble, Nyah... is something I can always arrange. This transponder chip is completely untraceable.
-What's going on? -Hagen wants Spec to hold the flag. I'm gonna miss playing waiter. Don't hold nothing back. The ball moved. No.
-Clear! Clear! Great work,Angels,but our job's only half-finished. There's still the matter of Mr.Knox's stolen technology. What's so special about your software? It's.... It's really quite amazing. We developed a program.You see,everyone's voice is unique.
- So? - So,... .. I guess there's this urban myth goin' around here at the moment. It's about a beach. - Yeah? - Uh-huh. And this beach is... perfect, man.
It's why we came here, isn't it? To make a new life. Move them along! Move them along! When I'm through in Mombasa, I'll pick up her cradle. It should be ready by now.
Not a single word of protest. Even the insolent Senator Gracchus was silent as a mouse. Why? I have been told of a certain sea snake... which has a very unusual method of attracting its prey. It will lie at the bottom of the ocean as if wounded. Then its enemies will approach... and yet it will lie quite still.
Don't worry. I'll sing, so you'll know where I am. After the bath, you'll be calmer. No more hitting on the head! All this trouble for a comb? It's mine.
I woke up. I woke up on a sidewalk. I had no idea where I was. I couldn't have told you the city I was in. My head was pounding... and I looked down and my shirt is covered in blood. And as I'm lying there, wondering what happens next I heard a voice.
What are your duties as chairman of the board? The board meets once or twice a week, and we take up important issues. - Yeah. Facts, problems. Things like that. Normal stuff. What kind of problems does an overnight success like Sunset Farms face? What kind of problems? Last week the toilet on the fourth floor wouldn't flush.
You know, you're such a know-everything. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to spot a clinker like this. Who ever made it for you, you overpaid. What can I do if you're wrong? What can I do? Can I take your nose and twist it till you turn blue? Sure. Gee, you broke it.
Of course I have. I don't want that dog dribbling on my seats. Your seats? Tyrone, this is a stolen car, mate. While I'm at the wheel, it's my car so stop that dog dribbling on my seats. I can't believe you found it.
We've got sandy beaches. So who the fuck wants to see them? I hope you can appreciate the concern I have for my friend Franky. I'll find him, and you'll help me find him. And we'll start at that fight. How am I gonna get it out?
Pepa, my little girl... Your death burns me. what's the matter? Listen. This tree's got duende. Sounds like a lament. This tree's got duende.
No. I had it changed in America. Was there a problem? It was going black. How odd. So the 4x4 is yours?
And one doesn't understand it... Because one thinks that beyond the wall... the road still goes on. What's the time? - Seven o'clock. What's the matter Galindo? The clock in our house is always ten minutes slow. So?
Five. The answers to which will reveal to me the truth. Five questions, Mr Poirot? Fire away. We know that Lord Edgware changed his mind on the subject of divorce and that he wrote to his wife to acquaint her of that. He sent it to the theatre.
No, you finally have to understand, girl. I am not your hero, your great guy. I am your first and most important man, but nothing more. Understand? Yes, I understand, but you still have to get into bed. The pain is very deep.
But I know what I did! Chamberlain's appeasement tragedy up to the agreement in Munich. And there were two people in the classroom! Terribly hard work, reading 4 pages and answering 2 questions. But when it's movie-time, suddenly everybody shows up! Maybe you can say something about the film.
"I go to the girl's place as usual." "I don't ask any questions." She doesn't mention the night before. Have some foie-gras, Lover. Or would you prefer caviar? Anyway, you must taste this wine.
It's a missing bullet. There were 5 left in your gun. If you add these up, 5 and 10 make 15. Since you aren't in the habit of loading an extra bullet, 15 matches the number you had to begin with. Then, what's this one bullet? It was neither shot by you nor recovered later.
Oh, no. Much worse. Now we're soul mates. Someone close the shutters. Seems wrong that I should die while the sun is still so bright. You'll not see it again.
- Say it! - Yet they live. - Get the movers. - Yes, sir. Get it out of here. Nice. Lindsey, give me the scroll.
This has been very interesting. Back away from the door! Riley, are you OK? Secure the room. We got a demon in here. It escaped through that vent.
Back away from the door! Riley, are you OK? Secure the room. We got a demon in here. It escaped through that vent. It's not the Polgara.
- Well, it's always important. Neither Xander is a demon. - ls one of them a robot? - What? No. The rod device, it's called a ferula-gemina.
I can't levitate when I want to, I can't premonition... - Guys! - What? I think the spell is working. Do you see it? What's it doing?
If you lived on a planet that wouldn't stop shaking, you might be doing the same thing. If they've reached this stage of industrial development, they must be observing us. The probe's impulse thrusters are starting to fail. At its present altitude, it's been operating for over 200 years. Its orbit is becoming decayed. lnitiate self-destruct.
Come back with me to Voyager. 38 minutes. You're wasting time. Another maturation chamber is malfunctioning. Its autonomic nervous system is failing. It's Borg.
38 minutes. You're wasting time. Another maturation chamber is malfunctioning. Its autonomic nervous system is failing. It's Borg. It will adapt.
then we'll talk. We've talked enough. Your requests are irrelevant. Comply, or we'll assimilate the others. It'll take us at least an hour to dismantle the deflector and transfer the components... Now. I can't give it to you now.
Perhaps not. I've thought of a better use for you. Come along, Samwise. Be careful, both of you. The enemy has many spies in his service: Birds, beasts.
As we know, the aliens display a distinct energy pattern. It is a fact that two opposing bio-etheric waves placed one over the other cancel each other out. It is theoretically possible to make a wave pattern in opposition to the Phantom energy. We are assembling such a wave and are near completion. Members of the council gathering plants and animals to fight the Phantoms is utter nonsense. The Zeus cannon is a proven, effective weapon.
It's just the ...migrant workers. Maybe we don't need so many. I sometimes wonder if we need them at all. They cost so much money! I want you to tell me what will happen to that stick. It will drown!
Maybe we don't need so many. I sometimes wonder if we need them at all. They cost so much money! I want you to tell me what will happen to that stick. It will drown! Suppose it doesn't.
I sometimes wonder if we need them at all. They cost so much money! I want you to tell me what will happen to that stick. It will drown! Suppose it doesn't. It will get stuck in the rocks!
Dad's code name must be Hombre. So, this must be Machete. We're getting help from Dad's best man? What are you working on? World's smallest camera. I don't see it.
It will accept no other. Wait a minute. Choose? So this thing is alive? In a way. The crystal thrives on the collective emotions of all who came before us. In return, it provides power, longevity, protection.
Yo, Wyatt. My limited-edition Coke can has me with a goatee. Everybody knows I shaved for the "Don't Tell Your Papa" video. This is wiggedy-wack, Wyatt. What's wiggedy-wack is your damn monkey. - Oh, here we go with the monkey again. - Yes, here we go again.
The knight Gregoire de Fronsac and his companion Mani... were neither hunters, nor were they soldiers. Naturalist and taxidermist to the king and royal gardens... Sir de Fronsac had quite a reputation in Paris... for being a libertine and a sharp wit. As for the man that followed him like a shadow... he was a foreigner, and you knew nothing about him. As night fell... the two voyagers arrived at the castle of the Marquis d'Apcher... who had offered them refuge in the Gevaudan region... for as long as their mission endured. Our people would not be afraid of a simple wolf. The beast is different.
And no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest and most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, Harry, who have never known your family you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it. Even gone mad.
I don't know, change things. Donnie Darko - what the hell kind of name is that? It's like a superhero or something. What makes you think I'm not? I should go. For physics, Montinoff is having me write this essay - the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.
Is Mom dead? Yes. If Martha doesn't find a replacement soon, I'll have my baby right here. My friend has been in bed for 6 weeks... In the tank, a lobster eats itself slowly from the inside. You have to weigh it when you buy it.
I'm still fuzzy on why you were here at night. With Betty Lou here. I was practicing for my fireman's exam, which started seven minutes ago. So I'd appreciate it if you'd let me go. So you and the blonde found the meteor? Yeah, I found it.
Man. ls that a graboid? JACK: Yeah, looks like it. Get back, son, you're going to lose a limb now. [Screams] Oh, God! JACK: It's flooded! BOY: Calm down, lady!
is that, you know, that, kind of "deserty," "underground monstery"? JODI: Exactly. All righty. Sure hope nothing stops you from becoming a viable entity because I hate when that happens. I'm billing you for that complimentary ice. You know, I really like this clay.
He's Ml6's man in Hong Kong. Anything else, Harker? Yes, sir. Yesterday, imagery Analysis delivered a file requested by Muir's secretary to your office. Did you receive that file, sir? I don't remember seeing it.
Yes, of course. It's been lovely weather again today, hasn't it... out of the sun, of course. Ah, the fish! The fish from one of those very rivers of yours, eh, Captain Hastings? Oh, isn't that a sturgeon? They call it a hybiarria out here.
An archeologist would murder us for not taking precautions before coming in here and distorting everything with our fingerprints. -What do you mean? -The ground is covered in dust. -How long will our footprints last? -A thousand years, maybe. This tunnel goes down.
Stop their war. You mustn't be off guard. Red. Here's a bug. It jumped! What bug?
In fact, I remember going to, uh job interviews, I, at various times, considered just going out getting a job. And I'd gone to a job interview. And I was talking to one of the people, and I started asking them about what tools they used, and they said, "Gee, we used bison++!" and I said, "Oh, I am the author of bison++!" Free Software generally does have a copyright. It does have an owner.

Director: Naoyuki Tomomatsu At the beginning of the 21st century all over the world 15 to 17 year old girls were dying by and by. Strangely enough the dead girls were reborn as zombies. Nobody knew why but those girls were called "Stacies". That name had become an international term.
"Blues Campbell's Right Hand 2"! Recently a girl suddenly turned into a Stacy. That's our task in the Rekill Research Laboratory, the former college of art for women. Any questions? How do you like this chainsaw? I used it for the first time today.
No one volume is complete without the other two. It's one book broken up into three pieces. - Like a trilogy. - No. Much more complex than that. See this passage?
- Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": - Your sister took my Key, Dawnie, and she won't give it back.
- Energy barrier. A most powerful one. - Can it be breached? The witch's magic pales to the might of our god. The infidel's wall shall tumble before us. Will?
He's a warlock now, what a familiar becomes when he betrays his witch. That must be why we can't kill him, the whole nine lives thing. So if we kill him five more times he should be gonzo, right? No, that's exactly what you can't do. You see, once a familiar becomes a warlock, it has until the next new moon to purge itself of its old life. If it succeeds, it becomes immortal.
I'll be on the bridge. - Report. - We're losing main power. Trip, what's happening? That last bolt struck the warp manifold. We've got an antimatter cascade, sir.
Ross, thank God you're here. You have to help me. Were you talking to yourself? That's less embarrassing. Yes. Yes, I was. "When she came in", I totally forgot about the camera.
- See you at 10:00. - But wait. You need keys. - No, I don't. I so don't want to know why. The op-ed page is sad. It's worse than sad.
- How do you like that mouth? - It's not very mouth-like. - I think it works.
Is he now? Yeah, and the key might go into him instead of you. Precisely, and that's why he is a very important part of this experiment. Because if the key does go into him, I shall press a second button and drop the pathetic little science student to his death. The key still won't go into you. We'll see.
And don't answer. Look, if you have a medical question, I'm forced by hospital policy to answer you. However, if you ask me about a personal problem, I'm going to start doing this. You seem unhappy. I like that. I cannot get that stupid song out of my head.
- Enough about your relationship. There are places a dick just can't go! Some dicks manage just fine. - Maria has ten dicks. - For the record, you started this. I am sorry, but a finger is not a dick.
I'm so excited. -Can we change the name? -Whatever you want, baby. This is Rocco. He works for you. The ring looks beautiful on you.
We, the people of Earth greet you in a spirit of peace and humility. As we venture out of our solar system, we hope to earn the trust and friendship of other worlds. Friendship I. I had to memorize that recording in third grade. Me, too. I even built a model of the probe. Then this should look familiar.
And what happened to her facial implants? I thought you removed all her cybernetic systems. Computer, end program. Commander? If you're looking for your other holographic friend, he's off-line at the moment. Your cortical node began to shut down. Fortunately, I managed to stabilize it before there was any permanent damage.
Oh, I know who you are. You're the drone with the Kirk fixation. You would be wise to follow lcheb's example. By applying himself, he's become a valued member of this crew. Can I see you naked again? Computer, run Diplomacy Scenario 12-Alpha. The planetoid is in Nausicaan space.
- With all due respect, Major, - your time is spent in the field. - She spent two years working on the gate prior to her five years of service at the SGC. She's the one who made this programme viable. Actually, the interface she designed is full of flaws. I admit it's not perfect, but it's...
And what are you going to do? Well... I was thinkin' about shootin' ya. Jack... what are you doing? Gettin' a little dirty for you, Maybourne? Bringing the gate room on line. The iris is holding, but it's starting to heat up.
It is not safe here. The forests are heavily patrolled. - We're not done, pal. - I so own you. There is a device in the chest that sensors indicate may be a power unit. Current status: deactivated.
- And knowledge of our systems. You're saying something was inside our computers? We're just guessing at this point, but... Whatever it was, we interrupted it before it completed its scan of our computer. Did you determine any more from the MALP transmissions? Nothing on or off world resembles the architecture.
- and I will not shut up about this until... - (vehicles approach) Never mind. This image was generated from satellite observations made in the last few hours. The asteroid has an irregular shape, but we've calculated its length from end to end to be approximately 137 kilometres. I've seen this movie.
- (vehicles approach) Never mind. This image was generated from satellite observations made in the last few hours. The asteroid has an irregular shape, but we've calculated its length from end to end to be approximately 137 kilometres. I've seen this movie. It hits Paris.
It's a tunnel from the old system. Been shut down for years. You see this, Agent Scully? You have this on your graphic? Yeah. lt's a fork in the line. That line is obsolete.
-Open the door. How are you doing? He is super fine. because the boy was employed in the funeral parlor. Go back to the funeral parlor! This autopsy is rustic. Nothing was done.
To remind me of what I owe God when I die. My father was killed in battle too. In Ireland, in the streets fighting those who would take as their privilege what could only be got and held by the decimation of a race. That war is 1 000 years old or more. We never expected it to follow us here. It didn't.
AN ASSASSIN. AND NOW THE HARD-LINERS HAVE THEIR PROOF. WE CANNOT TRUST THE WEST. YOU... YOU TOOK AWAY MY SON. YOUR FIRING SQUAD SHOULD HAVE DONE THE JOB FOR ME. I HOPED A WESTERN EDUCATION WOULD HELP HIM BECOME A BRIDGE... BETWEEN OUR WORLDS.
Yeah, I got to stay here. I got to figure this out. So figure it out. You take care of this car? What do you mean? The tires felt a little splashy on the way over here.
THE N2K'S AN EXTREMELY EFFICIENT MACHINE. FOR EXAMPLE, WHILE THE STUDENT BODY IS AWAY, E COMPUTER WILL SHUT DOWN ALL NON-ESSENTIAL SYSTEMS. NOW, THE PREFECTS ARE HERE. THE COMPUTER WILL BECOME AWARE OF THEIR PRESENCE, AND TAKE CARE OF ALL THEIR NEEDS. AWARE OF THEIR PRESENCE? THAT IS THE GENIUS OF THE N2K, MR. WALSH.
That's all there is, two bedrooms. You remember Dad's friend? Jack Barnes. From the club. He came by looking for your father. I was giving him a tour of the apartment.
Hey, Susie-Q. What you up to? I don't wanna bother you. Just thought I'd call and get some more info. I think you say some pretty smart things, John. Yeah, smartest guy I know, huh? So whatever happened to your nursery?
You are a bloody amateur. You're a faggot. Tell me, Mr. Barris. Are you in possession of my microfilm? - I got it. - Let's have it, then.
You won't help me? That's what I'm telling you. It's too late. There isn't anybody who can help you. In good conscience, I should say the custody hearing is probably a trick. It's not about itself.
BOWOh, my God! Hello? Jack, it's Lloyd Bowman. I solved the code. You need to know what it says right now. Okay, Lloyd.
Would you like to listen? By calling me here, you people have committed a grave mistake. Really? Now apologize for your mistake and tell me... When do I get to go? When we find the truck. - And when will you find it?
Not with me. Anyway, I brought a few items from home that might prove, ahem, embarrassing were the Ministry to call. Just poisons and the like. Look at that. That particular item is not for sale. I understand.
I'm part of the whole thing? Well, without the dinner theatre, we'd see each other less. I want to restart my career. You're kidding, right? - Well, what about my equipment? - Good news.
I'll hold his hand firm and turn you from the path of death! I'll stop you on the road to the land of the dead. Hear the dog howl and come back! I'll hold you firm and stop you from leaving your body. Hear the dog howl! It protects your hearth.
- That's a good sign. Perhaps. The thought of a grave with no name... Shall we sit on the couch and listen to some music? The spring of God is never dry You can drink and slake your thirst
Yes sir. Yes sir. Let's go. All team members get ready for the orders. The storm is coming. Typhoon 13 is heading north and rapidly gaining strength.
I could start a school somewhere. But... I'm a fallen woman. That's no fault of yours. You're not fallen. You're just unfortunate. But a body once soiled can never be made pure.
So? There's a return ticket from Italy in her pocket. - Probably from another trip. - It's dated last week. Why wouldn't she tell us about a trip to Italy? You are looking at a schematic of a Westbury 23 supercomputer.
We should prepare in case Khasinau's men show up. The floorboards over there lift up. This safehouse has saved me before. You know what would be great right now? A fire in that fireplace. I heard a chopper.
-... youcan'tthinkofyour--? -Ally! Even on vacation in Bermuda, you're not what I would call voracious. I'm a nibbler, right? I'm sorry. The sex was polite.
I still am. I had this enormous crush on Madelyn Pruitt. -I was in love with her. -Senior year in high school? Yes. And one day I found this note in my desk.
It's a national obsession, crazy cats. But somewhere, people all forget what a mess youth is. It's a time of magic, all right. And there's nothing more unreliable or annoying than magic. Let me tell you a little story. It starts with a kid.
So what do you want to talk about? It's Spike. He can hurt me... without his head exploding. Oh, my God. His chip stopped working? No.
Well, actually, he does. But he'll never say he loves you until he trusts you. And he'll never trust you until you tell him what you really are. You see why I always win these bargains. As an immortal being, I'm afraid only you can give up your life. Place this auger shell over your heart.
Okay, somebody's been watching way too much Discovery Channel. You're probably right, but she's an interesting evil specimen. Reminds me of this water demon I read about in the Book. She kills in the most fascinating way. - Paige. - What?
Reminds me of this water demon I read about in the Book. She kills in the most fascinating way. - Paige. - What? We know how it kills. What'd I say?
- A little rip there. My God, I'm sorry. Well, just take it back. I'm sure they'll fix it for you. Uh... couldn't you take it back? I don't even know where this store is.
- Beagles. - Yes. Let me ask you a question, Doc, just out of curiosity. Are there any dogs on your home world? The Denobulan Lemur is highly sought after. It's not exactly a dog, but you could say it's doglike.
You shouldn't have. They brought the weapons online right when we needed them. If you have no objection, I'd like to make it standard procedure. No objection, sir. You still need to work on that alarm. I'll get right on it.
Or where the wormhole network is. Yeah, and if we weren't trapped with only two weapons, about to die. Well, good new is, who better to save a Leviathan than us, huh? Hmm! So, we stay away from doggie, we find the Grudeks and we bring them down. So.
Moya's pain is... increasing. What is happening? ! It's in the frelling ship, the plant is in the frelling ship. Pilot, how far has it spread? I can't tell.
Come on. Pilot... what the yotz is wrong with the lights? I don't know! Well that's hardly good enough, is it? Find the problem, and fix it. Chiana, put it away.
- I think we should end the meeting here. - Wait a second. You, there, when Lady Godiva here wanted to be town troubadour over you... I stood by your side. Why aren't you backing me now? 'Cause you left me twisting for a long time before you did, and it didn't feel good. I wrote a song about the experience. I heard it.
- Come on in. Hey there, Mr Mouth. What have you got to say that is so important? I'm sorry. lt's been non-stop. This chair is a little controversial. But I don't give a shit.
You sure you're in the right place? Clark called, said he needed my help. I figured out how Lana got her visions. The explosion. You think the blast caused them? More than that.
- Even if they could find where you are... - And Jonas, he's at least as smart as you. - There isn't always a way out. - If that was true, I'd be dead by now. How many more times can you go into that sarcophagus before it changes you? How many times has it been already?
It takes guts wearing a pink shirt on the BPD Homicide unit. Yes, it does. Guts, or a familiarity with alternative lifestyles. -What are you chasing? -Toyota Camry. Whose?
She's smart and she's fierce. She moves any way she wants, as far as she wants. And she is the go-get-shit-done piece. Remind me of Stringer. And this, over here, is the castle. It's like the stash.
Maybe to booty call. Your mind is always in the gutter. There was no call. Tom Wilkins, 11:48. In my experience, there's usually not a three-hour lag... between the call... and the delivery. When she first came in that night, she didn't have the pack.
What did you see? I looked into your future, and I saw death. But there is also life. You saw there was a child. You saw my son. That future is almost gone.
Then I think it's time for me to know a few more things. So do I. Tell me how I separated my mind from my body without jacking in. Tell me how I stopped four sentinels by thinking it. Tell me just what the hell is happening to me. The power of the One extends beyond this world.
Shouldn't you ask the government that? I am the government and I'm asking you. Let me. You're brave. They say that sea urchin's the ultimate acquired taste. Hmm. It's a personal favourite of mine.
Just reload and shoot. Pour it into them, boys! Fill that line in! Fill this hole now! Dress to the right! Fire!
Powerful, dangerous. Marquez, he really had it in for this Mariachi, see. They called him "Mariachi" because he used to carry this guitar. A guitar? Believe me, he really knew how to play it too. Look, this story is well-traveled.
I look tired anyway. Yeah, but you look great. What's the matter? It's these dreams, Doctor. I keep having them, and they're terrible. Tell me about your dream.
- Why? - Why? Does somebody have a can of air freshener? Quick and dirty. The thin skin, that's the Earth's crust. That's what we live on.
Get out! Theo! Theo! Theo! Theo! A revolution isn't a gala dinner.
They're the same species of curculio. If you had to choose. If you were forced to make a choice. If there was no other... Well then, if you're going to push me, I would choose the right-hand weevil.
- We're flying down the hall. Orderly after orderly is chasing us. Mom and Josephine are at the end. No time to explain! Stall them! We come flying out over the kerb... and your old red Charger is there.
-Here he comes. -Not likely. -Do you have a wrench, Green? -No. Is it the fan belt? Yes.
Goal! Goal! 3-2 for Germany over Hungary, a team that hasn't lost a game for 4 1/ 2 years. The second hand is moving so slowly. I stare over at it. Speed up! Faster!
What are these pictures of? Michael, look at the rest of the pictures. Look at the last one. Oh, my God. It's the future. The machine predicts a war, and we go to war to avert it.
- Emergency override. Cancel activation. - You are not authorised. - How do we stop this thing? - You can't. The Rook is a fully autonomous operative. Its body armour is five times more effective than the armour you wear now.
Agneta? - Lasse, come on! - What? Well... I have an idea. It may sound stupid, but I've been thinking it over.
More hocus-pocus. I bid you welcome... to the Hall of Odin. Uh, listen, Mr Hellstrom, you've caught some bad breaks... but there's no reason to take it out on the world. - I know you. - It's the spear. Its power is one of destruction.
We are going to watch a meal. The wine looks splendid in the glass. And onto the plate lovely fish, with rice, onions, lemon, and a green sauce. With it, a bottle of chablis. How does the perfect human eat? The fish is a beautiful sight on a table.
You start with a group of people who wanna invest their money in a company. Then these people apply for a charter as a corporation. This government issues a charter to that corporation. Now that corporation operates legally as an individual person it is not a group of people it is under the law a legal person. Imperial Steel Incorporated has many of the legal rights of a person. It can buy and sell property...

Thank you, monsieur, I have. And for 35 years, I used them honestly. After that, nobody wanted them. So I was forced to go into business for myself. As for being a mass killer, does not the world encourage it? Is it not building weapons of destruction for the sole purpose of mass killing?
No, my wife would like cause no other life. Has she given you that? Who else? Look at this. Is not that great? Jill can you get the idea.
- I'm in a plane. A plane? Why? There's something I've gotta tell you. It'll be hard to hear, so I need you to stick with me. We found the bomb. It was wired in a way that made it impossible to diffuse it.
- This is President Palmer. - This is Ryan Chappelle. - Hello. - Jack Bauer is on the line as well. He'll give you an update. Mr President, I found the chip. Unfortunately, it's been badly damaged.
What happens if they went in winter, when the sun is cold? The sun is not cold in the winter. Me know you's been axed this a zillion times, it must really get on your tits being axed it, but let's just sort it out. What do you say to all those conspiracy theorists who come up to you and say: 'Does the moon really exist? ' I don't think there are very many people who question whether the moon exists.
And, uh, take a look at what I found. This is the last thing Gendler saw. It's Sloane. I've chartered a C-123 out of Shipman to transport the artifacts. I will be in touch. "Shipman" could refer to the airfield in the Mojave desert. We've surveilled it before.
Angel's soul. It's gone. WO-PANG: Must acquire better guards. Angel's soul has been stolen. I have no need for the vampire's soul. Then where is it? That I cannot discern.
Silly old Lorne, thinking it was about saving the world from ending. Welcome to the big leagues, Angel. You're a champion. You don't get personal days. There's nothing on this Beast, Lorne. I fought it once. It nearly decapitated me with my own stake.
Welcome to the big leagues, Angel. You're a champion. You don't get personal days. There's nothing on this Beast, Lorne. I fought it once. It nearly decapitated me with my own stake. It's killed hundreds that I couldn't save.
How else could you have heard my call? Thank you. I just don't understand how all this could have happened. How what could've happened? This. Piper's club.
- Why not? - Well, for starters, I have a job. Well, I'm your boss, I'll transfer you. Okay, and how about my family? My sisters and my new little nephew? You can use the jet whenever you want.
- I didn't. I poured me a cup. - Where's your sugar? - Sugar's in the sugar bowl. That's my cup. I'm the only one drinks out of that cup. Rinse it out and put it back where you found it.
I suppose that's very quaint, too. Not at all. We charge our weapons the same way. Well, maybe you'd like to see the phase-cannon assembly. Please. After you.
You might want to look out the window, sir. Thermal shear. Some of those eruptions are getting close to Enterprise. - Take us up another 5,000 kilometres. - Aye, sir. Captain... I'm reading bio-signs on the planet. To quote Dr Frankenstein, "It's alive."
You're not getting enough sleep and you're watching too much of this. They hate you guys. Well, I liked it there. You see the show? - No. - You should.
Get us to the surface. I'll signal Lo'Lah and then we go! - We must destroy them. - Why? The mother plant is the key. It fertilizes the others.
- You're late. - I'm sorry. I told you to get it back three hours before... I actually needed it back, and it worked out. - You rat. - So, it's in park?
So what's agent Mcgee like? Uh, like most newbies. Quiet, green, gullible. Bi. I don't think so. / No, Tony, the canister.
- Don't listen. Just do what you came here to do. Forgive us, Sovereign. It is the only way to protect our people. I will not surrender this body, not at any cost. It is mine.
I go with you, or no deal. Harry, you're under arrest. I've got the stone and I'm walkin' out that door. You're not in a strong bargaining position. The mission will only be successful if I'm on it. That stone is useless without the combination. How's that?
Harry, you're under arrest. I've got the stone and I'm walkin' out that door. You're not in a strong bargaining position. The mission will only be successful if I'm on it. That stone is useless without the combination. How's that? It was originally found over 80 years ago in a pharaoh's tomb in Egypt.
And by that time, your people's gonna be in the Towers... and if the money's right, then that is what it is. Ain't no nigger from New York gonna change the facts from the ground. All right? 12-08 to 11-37, you there? 11-37, what you got? That last truck is on the move.
In fact, don't pretend. There is a story, Riddick, of young male Furyans... strangled at birth. Strangled with their own cords. When Aereon told this story to the Helion leaders... I told her of you. What do you know of your early years? Do you remember your homeworld?
I got a blue Beemer on Morningside. Good. I'll take it. Ten-four. Units, stand by... unless you have an emergency. License and registration. I'm gonna need you to pop the trunk for me. I gotta open it myself.
A miracle. Just undiscovered science from an American... named Thomas Edison. - It turns on with a whistle. please, don't do that. I see your eye is drawn to what I hope will oneday... be my crowningachievement. It's a flying machine.
For all I know you could have been kidnapped by rebels ! It's not them you should worry about. - What did you say ? You're right, I'm sorry. I should have called. Where's your book bag ? I left it at school.
Seriously? Isn't he a wizard or something, is he? He was very gentle. And he saved me. So you had your heart stolen, haven't you? If that wizar had been Howl, your heart would have been eaten.
It seems I still have long way to go. Thank goodness. Fortunately, my teeth are as well as before. That is best suitable as a cane, isn't it? Well, then... Ouch!
Connect the ball. Right away! When the right adjustment valve starts to vent put in the ball. Hurry! Stop wasting time! It is with the greatest pleasure that we declare this Exhibition of Science open.
The chair must remind members that under Section 18 of Title 3 United States Code, no debate is allowed in the joint session. Thank you, Mr. President. To answer your question the objection is in writing, signed by a number of members of the House of Representatives, but not by a member of the Senate. Mr. President, it is in writing and signed by several House colleagues on behalf, and myself, of the 27,000 voters of Duval County in which 16,000 of them are African-Americans that was disenfranchised in this last election. Is the objection signed by a member of the Senate? Not signed by a member of the Senate. The Senate is missing.
There is a secret test hidden within the SAT. This test does not measure a student's aptitude at reading, writing and arithmetic.
Not shouldn't be done. It can't be done. Let me prove it to you. OK, Ben, pay attention. I've brought you to the Library of Congress. Why?
- What? It's not here. It's there. Come on. - What bell is this? - It's the Centennial Bell.
Just tell me. Color in red wines comes from the skins. This juice, on the other hand, is free-run. So that there's no skin content.... Did you read the latest draft? -Oh, yeah. Yeah. -And?
Like, if I opened a bottle today it would taste different than if I'd opened it on any other day. Because a bottle of wine is actually alive. And it's constantly evolving and gaining complexity. That is, until it peaks. Like your '61 . And then it begins its steady, inevitable decline.
Here's what happens if you lose. The device you're wearing is hooked into your upper and lower jaws. When the timer on the back goes off, your mouth will be permanently ripped open. Think of it like a reverse bear trap. Here, I'll show you. There's only one key to open the device.
That's you, right? Let me, I know how. Me too... You can see La Jument. In line with the reefs. Looks small from here.
No one can say. He won't get well if you don't take care of him. Tell me. - What do you mean? If I'm going to save your ass tell me where the container is and who you're dealing with. Where is it?
What's that? Looks like leather work, sir. - Oh, right. - Sir, we got the weapon. Come on, pick it up. Been in the pool, destroyed any fingerprints that might have been on it.
Yes. Coming! Got a beer? What happened? A clarification with Geneviève. I'm selling the apartment. We had an extremely sharp discussion.
Educated at Harvard, Chicago, Oxford or Buenos Aires, their portraits hang in the official galleries. There you can see 19th century lobbyists, like Manual García and Beláustegui, or the latest heads of the public banking system, Pedro Pou, Macarrone and Colombo, administrators of a debt that was born in the 197 0s under the military dictatorship. We have turned the page of government interventionism... The present debt was the illegitimate offspring of the military dictatorship. Even though the Courts demonstrated its fraudulent origins, the pressure of the Establishment won the day.
Would you like to see her photograph? No, I'd rather not. Come, I'll show you something else. These are her musical scores. The ones they found on the bridge. Music on its own is silent.
Not so fast. Calm down. Sit down, older brother. Collé, have you gone mad? How dare you expel my elder from my house? Young brother, have you given up your authority as a husband? Purification dates way back.
Breech sight and 4: Elevation change. You learned these yesterday. Questions? Yes? This book says the English 'Armstrong' cannon has a vent piece, so you don't have to stick your finger in it.
If anyone suspects that I was here, there will be an investigation, and both of us will go to prison. I was never here. You understand me? Julia, you tell me right now that you understand what I'm saying. I understand. Stop that process.
Not this girl. Not this day. ANGEL: Tell me what was in that box. A name, a history, anything. - We can't get it open. WESLEY: Where did it come from?
He's gotta be hiding in the underworld. I agree. It's the only place he can go to avoid being sensed. Which means he must have both of our Wyatts there too. Still, it's too vast. We have to narrow it down.
- I suppose I am. Okay, everyone, settle down, please. We have something very special to share with you today, a very special report on the Komodo dragon by Francis Bischetti. "The komodo dragon, or varanus komodoensis," by Francis Bischetti. The komodo is found exclusively on the indonesian islands of Komodo, Rintja, Padar, Gili, and Mota.
You'd kill us all, rather than let the embryos be born. It wasn't my idea. The orders came from Starfleet, but after seeing this... I can't say I disagree. We were defending our right to exist. You've already killed over 25 people. Your existence has a pretty high price.
Previously on Enterprise. How do you plan to get inside it? We're pretty sure we found a way in. I'm sending a crew in a shuttlepod. The spheres are controlled by a network of artificial intelligence. This section houses a redundant memory core.
He has a bad temper. What my husband did to you today -- it was a misunderstanding. No, I got it. Loud and clear. It was the watch. Your husband tried to murder me for a watch? I found this watch two days ago.
Believe me, she's good at it. Send her my love. Well, I was hoping that wouldn't be necessary. That's why I'm here. I was hoping you might come back with me to Los angeles. I'm producing a new game show.
All right, we might have had a glitch or two, but nothing that wouldn't have been corrected before production. See, you i did figure for the party line type. What's that supposed to mean? Why was there only one prototype made? I funded all the RD personally. I don't have pockets that deep. This loss is just devastating.
On top is the partial we cast at the scene. - You matched them. - I did. But here's the bad news. This particular brand is like the prom queen of tyres. It's very popular.
- May I? - I don't give a fuck. You can sit in there till fucking San Gennaro. It'll still need to be dealt with. This car went through a major collision. It seems OK.
You have that power too? I told you, Bulrog has lots and lots of powers. Behold. This way, I can move about the crowd of people undetected. - Here, hold this stuff for me. - Good luck, Bulrog. Now, this lamp comes from the estate of Edna and James Hollinger, who lived in upstate Wyoming.
The chair will only end the game under two conditions: Once you complete the scenario or if you engage the internal fail-safe, - which you're free to do at any time. - That will be unnecessary. Don't be so cocky. The chair is intuitive.
We need that... What is it? I found the cipher. I'm downloading it now from the subspace link. - I have it. - We need to load it into the mainframe.
He's responding to treatment. His white cell count is coming down. - What about Colonel Vaselov? - He's not so good. We're treating him with antibiotics, but he is deteriorating. Until we know more about the source of the infection, there's not much we can do.
- She says Keffler made her. - What does that mean? - Some sort of genetic research? - No, she's over 20 years old. The Asgard can rapidly grow a human clone, but... Area 51 has a sample of Goa'uld nanite technology from the planet Argos.
Do you have any more with one of those on it? Maybe on an ark? I got it. It's one of Anna's sketches. I think it's a combination to open the ark. - Did we just do that? - I do not believe so.
Eight. Oh! So what's Ishta think of all this? Ishta believes traditions should persist at all costs, especially in the face of oppression. I see. Rya'c is too young to know what love is, O'Neill.
We're underwater. I'd say we're under several hundred feet of ocean. This could be a problem. Oh, no! Dr Weir, I need to see you in the control room immediately. The city has a shield, a force field holding the water back.
Oh, they're charming. Perfectly charming. Long ago this city was a testament to our imagination, our creative spirit, to endless possibility. How long ago was that? We have been forced to rebuild many times, never to our potential. That is why perfecting the drug is so important.
Perfectly charming. Long ago this city was a testament to our imagination, our creative spirit, to endless possibility. How long ago was that? We have been forced to rebuild many times, never to our potential. That is why perfecting the drug is so important. It is more than a defence against the Wraith.
I even tried to shoot it off. Nine mil, point-blank. Not much worse I can do without killing the major. I believe the creature is related to the Wraith. - Really? - How so?
You wanna go the other way. Assholes. We'll start the interior construction within the week. Which means we need to readdress the budget. Readdress how? Well, for one, the price of steel has doubled.
None of this should come down on Theresa. I made her do everything. Well, that's gonna be up to the prosecution, Mr. Kraus. Now, would you mind telling us how this whole thing went down? When I got out in '91, the first thing I did was go looking for Lauren and Serene. I went over to her apartment.
Love can be cruel. - And beautiful. - But cruel. I mean, I'm not saying it's her fault. She can't help what she is. But look at that beak.
What did you say? I said I'm a real person, asswipe! ...Oh my God. What's happening? The robot... It thinks it's alive.
Take back this cow before it does more damage. Don't you want your animal? Come. I claim this cow for the damage it did. Take it back to them. If you don't the soldiers will come.
Does he need shoulder building-up? Does the cape flow? I mean, it was nearly impossible. Some of the things have legs, and some of them have less legs. The cape has less legs, let's face it. It was constantly being changed for various reasons.
The drawings. The spells. The blood moon comes tonight. It has to do with the eclipse. It has to do with the eclipse. Listen to me. We know why your forest is enchanted.
Are you in love? Are you feeling better, Ishtar? I'm well again, Grandfather. Bab'Aziz, I heard a cat. So did I. Let me down! It must be lost.
But he didn't do anything to you. So you admit that you did something. I admit, according to you, I did something, sure. - You dimed me out. - I did not dime you out. When the sheriffs asked where you got the car, I said I didn't know.
What do you mean? Do you think everything's has something it's supposed to do or be? Kind of a nice thought. I sat here a lot of times. I looked at this tree and i wondered if that branch had a purpose. Maybe it's here... to provide shade.
- Maybe I should drive. - Not a chance. Nobody but me can keep this heap running. Besides, from the sound of things, you might have to shoot somebody. - I don't have a gun. - Under the seat.
What is it? Is it terrorists? No, this came from someplace else. - What do you mean, like, Europe? - No, Robbie, not like Europe! That machine, it was already buried.
Hi. It's me. It's strange to hear your voice. I wanted to tell you I got your letter. And? I suppose you found it ridiculous. I was touched by it.
You know... Hmm? I've thought a lot about the soul. It's found in the body and so... Uh-huh. I think it moves around.
- Don't think about her. - ... reading a book. Why? I can't compete with her. you don't have to compete with her. Liar. You don't have to do this. As if the act in itself mattered.
It's technicality. Don't you know what we've already done? Your skin is different from I remember. The texture is different. How? Rougher? No, not rougher.
That's Vinagra for you. It's a miracle. Hey! Hey! Who's going to take advantage of this now? This surveillance is terrible. Yes, it is.
Look! Dawa, where is my ball? Here, try. I don't want to play. Where is my ball? I traded it.
Are you happy now? You've made an old man piss in his pants. Why are you following me? Why? I saw a dog once. Two kicks - And its back was broken.
There are so many films, science-fiction films that I saw as a kid and as a teenager that have left indelible images. I can just go to that file and flip through it and see those pictures. As if I had just seen it yesterday. The atomic age ushered in the first great age of movie science-fiction. When you come through the Second World War you've got a very specific enemy. You know what that enemy is.
Because we really have all of the tools of tolerance and kind of like global understanding and that's why we, the children, need to be empowered to tell the parents what they need to know to protect all of us, you know, as a whole. And that's what that movie kind of was saying at the end. Four, three, two, one, fire. I don't understand. Why did it destroy the thunder? Why? Why?
The mirror fell to earth and broke into a million billion pieces. Then it caused far greater unhappiness, which pleased the magician even more. Some of those fragments were made into spectacles. And those who looked through them saw only bad things. But how does the story end? It has never ended.
Who are you going to be? Me? An old maid... An old maid? You are joking. I have a surprise for you.
- The table is just right for the new play. We want to give it the best chance we can. We don't want it closing as soon as it opens, like Murder In Mayfair. Close, did it? That's a surprise! The malachite table is especially nice.
At one point they almost killed off the Oc culture. You know why? They were tolerant. I don't like the word "tolerant". If you have to tolerate someone, it means you there's no equality. I believe... that all violence stems from sexual repression.
- The engine's out. Put me in a position to bail. There he is. I got you covered. Clear. Tell me where the missile is. Tell me where it is.
Well, not necessarily. Marwan's their suspect. They'll assume he was behind it. And what about the damage it'll do to threst of the infrastructure? A lot better than destroying the entire company. It'll take some time, but we can rebuild. yeah? The EMP has been activated, sir. And the shield door is open. Okay, good.
- Well, no. Of course not. I need to set a relay closer to the building so I can boost your signal. - Copy that. - Got it. I can do it.
Equipment failures. Sir, I think I've found what's causing it. What is that? (Baltar) A Cylon logic bomb. A heuristic computer virus. It's capable of learning, evolving.
Are you interested? Yeah. Good. Then you won't mind going on a little trip with me. I know the power-switching spell is in here. We've used it before.
Margaret Blaine, she's with MI5. There's no more information, sir. I personally escorted the Prime Minister from the cabinet room to his car. This is Oliver Charles, transport liaison. The car's disappeared. There's no record of it, sir.
I've got to do this. I've got to end it. The Daleks destroyed my home, my people. I've got nothing left. Look at it. What's it doing? It's the sunlight.
It was the tea. Fixed his head. That's all I needed. Cup of tea. - I said so. - And look at him. Is it him, though?
Live long and prosper. Board that ship! Take everything you can! Captain's Starlog, January 13,2155. We've left Gorlan Station and have set a course... to rendezvous with our assault fleet. Major Reed and the Doctor have asked for a few minutes... to show me their latest project. The Booth will be far more effective than our previous disciplinary methods.
- This one especially. It's going from weird to weirder. - The usual beverage for everybody? - So he's not your dog? It just showed up in our yard yesterday morning. We have no idea how it got here, where it came from.
Now... how did you conceive it, this, uh... "Theory of Everything"? Are you familiar with quantum physics? Mm. Oh, then it is the Unified Field Theory. The unified what theory? Simply, Einstein's... attempt to... explain the mind of God. Well, that's a marvelous way of looking at it.
They make boxes. Lucrative business. Everybody needs boxes. Which reminds me -- your sneaker factory in Canada -- I have a sneaker factory in Canada? Well, not anymore.
Lucrative business. Everybody needs boxes. Which reminds me -- your sneaker factory in Canada -- I have a sneaker factory in Canada? Well, not anymore. It was destroyed in a fire last month.
Go, ask her if they're insane. Just ask her. I'm not gonna ask her that, Mr. Monk. And of course we can't press all of our wine like this. It would take too long. But we do make one label using this method. The allacco cabernet.
No, he gets laid all the time, you know, thomas' father? Yeah. My husband, he's -- he's an english lit professor. Very, very popular with the undergraduate girls. All my efforts over all these years, and the only thing that works for me is history. I judge it.
You are suggesting we attempt to trigger a subspace connection between the remains of the arm and the rest of the replicators so that we may search for the cipher among their communications data. - Too wild and crazy? - To do that, we must reactivate the cells. I know. What makes this place so special? The temple at Dakara is sacred to all Jaffa.
Really? And you're telling me this... why? Because you must destroy it before my fleet arrives to claim it. All right, you got me. I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about. The weapon on Dakara was built by the Ancients.
Right away. I want a status report as soon as his radio's working. Caldwell out. Nice stalling! Have you been unable to disconnect yourself from the system? No. I'm still trying to get the information on that communiqué. Oh good. We thought maybe it was preventing your from exiting the program.
- Ballpark. Months? Weeks? - Days. We have days. OK, what's the plan? I've injected him with a viral inhibitor.
If they get their hands on the Daedalus, they'll not only have access to the intergalactic hyperdrive technology... but they'll have all the navigation data that'll lead them straight to Earth. That's what they wanted all along. A new feeding ground. That still doesn't explain who killed Dr. Monroe and Dr. Lindstrom. That's what I'm trying to tell you. It was the virus. Look, it's an A.I., an artificial intelligence.
What is it? We're veering off course. Navigational controls are not responding. Damn it! Engine room, what's happening? The virus, it's back!
Where's she buried? She wasn't. She was cremated. What about that mirror? It's not in some evidence lockup, is it? No.
Tell me what happened. Everything. I heard.... I thought I heard.... There was this voice. -What did it say? -lt said....
If you eat enough of it, over years you become this less-than-human thing. You're always hungry. So if that's true, how can Tommy still be alive? -You're not gonna like it. -Tell me. More than anything, a Wendigo knows how to last long winters without food.
You're always hungry. So if that's true, how can Tommy still be alive? -You're not gonna like it. -Tell me. More than anything, a Wendigo knows how to last long winters without food. It hibernates for years at a time.
So if that's true, how can Tommy still be alive? -You're not gonna like it. -Tell me. More than anything, a Wendigo knows how to last long winters without food. It hibernates for years at a time. When it's awake, it keeps its victims alive.
- So salmonella is on the rise, so no. Listen, there's something I wanna talk to you about. Am I in trouble? The mountain lion you shot did it have a collar around its neck? No. Did it make kind of a meowing sound?
B and E and sexual assault. - Unfortunately, his alibi checked out. - What about the lawyer? Security guard clocked him leaving his office after midnight. - Did you find the ad? - Yeah.
What questions? Jack! Stop it, now. What the hell's going on? The case is closed. What you mean it's closed?
AII right. I will help you find Barbara Stritzke. But afterwards.. . The Legion gets the comb. AII right. deal. What does the comb do?
Onthesecondevening of our visit, theMaharajah gave a banquet in our honour. Ihaveneverwitnessed such splendour, butitpaledbycomparison with the magnificent Ruby of Agrapur. I see the Ruby intrigues you, Major Marchbanks. It was discovered in Burma six centuries ago. and given in tribute to the princely house of Agrapur. It is beautiful. A fatal beauty alas, the cause of many deaths.
We should go. Where is the keystone? Do not test me! - Let her go! - Don't hurt her. Give me the keystone! Give it to me! Here!
But give me a moment. What are you doing? I'm sorry. Oh, the map. It's ruined. The Grail.
How would we find it? With this. My compass is unique. "Unique" here having the meaning of "broken". True enough, this compass does not point north. Where does it point?
Let's get to the circle. I'll be right back. You feel that? It's happening. Someone's helping us. Send the energy back.
Listen to this here. Sure, in 1967 there were many suicides. But why in 1977? You must explain. You must describe the social conditions more clearly. It should remain literature, not political agitation. The text is great. I just want to be sure people understand it in the West.
Who wouldn't, in her situation? - Talked to her before she died. - You did? She called. We were still talking when we reached the location. We didn't make it in time... Tell me about it.
I knew I'd never be like them. Beautiful creatures. I'd never make the grade. At the end of my vacation I crept into Jane's room. I jerked off on my mother. And this fucking cat was watching me the whole time.
Good, I'll see you on Friday. Friday. - Excuse me! - Excuse me! Your wallet. It was in your jacket. Oh, thank you.
- Yes, boss. - Come on. Tell me about the stone. Is it clear or is it milky? Clear. And the color, is it strong?
I've managed to become thin without having any real muscle on me whatsoever. Very tough thing to accomplish, by the way. I'm proud of myself. Well, you look terrific. Thanks. I heard your trip went really well.
It's a massacre. No, it's France. And this is war! Chartreux, look. Look at this bible. Look at it! It saved my life. It stopped a bullet hitting me in the heart.
No, it's France. And this is war! Chartreux, look. Look at this bible. Look at it! It saved my life. It stopped a bullet hitting me in the heart. It speaks of courage and the honour of sacrifice.
If she hadn't, I'd not be here now. Astrid became the mother and sister I'd lost. And an inspiration for survival. Come on! Excuse me. Where does this road lead?
-Get in. OK. This had better be good, Mr Santilli. (Muffled cries) ls there someone in the boot? Just concentrate on telling me about this film. Well, it's the most unbelievable thing you've ever seen. Unbelievable.
Madame Rosaleen Cloade. - What about her? - l think she is not well. Be kind enough to call upon her, and send to me the bill? Of course. The murder weapon is not what killed him.
- Are you ok? Do you need to go to the hospital? - No. That lousy medicine makes me powerless. What the hell is happening? I think you should go, Klara. There is nothing for you to do here. Don't talk like that to Klara.
You should be a nurse, girl. What? And leave my good-paying job as a stripper? My mother was a nurse in Puerto Rico. Minimum wage. - Do I believe this story? - Why not?
Let me know if the kids need anything. Sheriff, you there? Stay awake. Stay awake till... Does this bus have a gas can? If the bus...
China's playing a bigger role, so is Europe. But we are still by all odds the largest contributor. And so it is up to us to look at how we think about it, because our way of thinking is the third and final factor that transforms our relationship to the Earth. If a frog jumps into a pot of boiling water, it jumps right out again because it senses the danger. But the very same frog, if it jumps into a pot of lukewarm water that is slowly brought to a boil, will just sit there and it won't move. It'll just sit there, even as the temperature continues to go up and up.

This is a place where you should not be. But why are you here? You think I'm the same as you? Do you remember what you've done? all the strange things started to happen after writing the Recycle It's because of this? This place is created by you.
You're not going to shoot those little creatures. In the first place, they haven't done you any harm. In the second place, they may be radioactive. If they fall in the reservoir, they may contaminate the water supply. Save your time and ammunition, Benson. Shot on a dusty backlot in Culver City, California, in just 12 days the movie was a box-office success.
Look what we found on the hostile. Hold on, Bill. It's a remote timing display. Can we defuse the detonator? Not in 60 seconds. We'll have to get it out of here.
I know a place where you can stay where you will be safe. How much time do I have? Weeks. A month at the outside. Unless the cancer goes to your brain. I'm afraid the tests are positive. The mass is malignant.
Not a chance. Mission rules say we head back. Frak me! It was the first jump! Hey, look, you gave me these coordinates. Back to the barn. Hey, I'm picking up a large planetary body.
No. I really don't want the rainforest to die. Well, that's what will happen if you open the red door. Hello, IT. Have you tried turning it off and on again? OK.
Yes, yes. Well, we're happy to have you. Oh. Oh! My milky lens has popped out! Don't step on it. You've got to help me find it.
Darrel Cain, captain Leland Stottlemeyer. Natalie Teeger. Adrian Monk. Hi. Mr. Cain says he was home last week. But he didn't see anything. / Excuse me. That box is addressed to Joanne Raphelson. Yeah.
You just said it was all about the garage door. It's about the doll and the garage door. It's about both. Mr. Cain, where did you get that doll? I... / Come on. You stole it, didn't you?
- Welcome aboard. - Whoa, whoa, wait. This inspection sticker expired yesterday. - Yeah, I'm taking care of that tomorrow. - Expired. It's expired. Mr. Monk, it's a million dollars. Please get in the cab for me.
- Well, it stands to reason. Rand knows that Caledonia has nothing even close to capable of reaching orbit. Although, there do appear to be sensors built into the targeting system, so our approach may be detected. The Prometheus is protected by Asgard shield technology. Exactly. Now, as I said, even if they do see us coming, the weapon will take a few minutes to charge up.
Give me the steino-magnetic... the thing in your left hand. Sounds like you're on its side. I sympathize, that's all. The Isolus has caused a lot of pain for these people. It's a child. That's why it went to Chloe. Hmm. Feels to me like a temper tantrum cos it can't get its own way.
I didn't know him. Your mom said some pretty horrible stuff about him when we were growing up. I think I saw him. When I was in the chair. Lincoln... It was him.
-Just for a second. I'm sorry. I told you not to leave this room. I told you not to let him out of your sight. Dad just grabbed us and booked. Dropped us off at Pastor Jim's about three hours away. By the time he got back to Fort Douglas, the Shtriga disappeared.
The vaccine was in here! Where is it? Where is it? The vaccine was in here! Where is it? You were bringing me back here! Where is it?
How's it going? They're about to remove Hannah's liver. All right, I'm good to go. You can start removing Max's liver. You wanna let me in on what the big secret is between these two? You read Foreman's article?
No. Wait a minute. - This doesn't make any sense. It's headed straight for the planet where we left Beckett and the prisoners. There's no reason for the Wraith to be interested in that planet. No stargate, and no indication it ever supported a human population.
It's so good. Not even dying could be so good. Let me smell your neck, your breath, your hair... After that long wait, when I thought I'd lost you. Last night I saw a shooting star. But I'm so silly, I couldn't think of a wish to make.
- You did, didn't you? So I'm asking you now: Have you ever had an orgasm? This cheese is good... Like some? You must be out of your mind! You don't have to make it breakfast. It won't fall asleep.
And it can do something very few men can do. It has a rotating tip. And it has a little helper too. Here you are. Pick it up! Don't worry. It's not a substitute.
Forgive me. I should have listened to you. You were right. - I did not mean to do it-- - Shh, shh, shh. The work being done in this place is important, Eko.
- Four years, maybe. - Four years? Not that I didn't check to see if she's published. You realize what this proof means, right? - Yes, if the math checks out. - I've been over it.
Absurd we can do. We have a zero-point module... which does what we're attempting on a smaller scale: Extract energy from subspace-time. - So subspace is real? - You're flying in it. Aren't you worried about the exotic particles crossing back over my bridge? That's the beauty of your theory.
Hi. We're looking for something called the Parchment of Virtues. Another band of stalwart heroes come to tempt fate in the hopes of claiming the legendary prize. - What do you know of the Sangraal? - Only what I have heard from legend. That it is located in a cave beyond the outlying forest, but that the journey there is fraught with peril. Ages ago, Morgan Le Fay enchanted the area with a terrible curse.
Think about this for a second... They brought a bunch of deaf people to see a ventriloquist! WHAT? ! What's do you do next? Go take on the blind folks to see David Copperfield. "The elephant disappeared"
I don't know what else I could've done. What the hell is this? It's all perfectly legal. You'll find a signed executive order on file authorizing a secret jury of six men and women to try, sentence and execute people guilty of extraordinary crimes while collaborating with the enemy at a time of war. There's also a death warrant with my signature for every conviction. Your presidency is a farce.
Shut up! No way! Can I see that one, please? Yeah, that's the Diamond Blossom. Yeah, the right hand diamond is very popular these days. All the stars are wearing it.
Sounds like we're conspiring against him. - I'm gonna tell him. - No, you're not. Then come up with a cunning plan and fast. She's not nearly as delightful as she thinks she is. What's this machine do?
- I'm gonna tell him. - No, you're not. Then come up with a cunning plan and fast. She's not nearly as delightful as she thinks she is. What's this machine do? It makes a lot of noise.
Mr. Bellick. Don't talk to me. Fine, but it's going to make collaboration kind of hard. Collaboration? I got men out here in harm's way, and you're giving press conferences. The press is a tool.
It's the head writer of The Girlie Show, Liz Lemon! The Girlie Show. Hold on, I'll connect you. - Hey. - What's up? Hey, have you looked at that Cat Lady sketch?
- Yeah. No, I know. - I was just upset. Well, you had every right to be. That article was awful. It wasn't awful.
It brings people back to life. Just for two minutes, we could question the murder victims. That's exactly what she said. She was one of us, we trusted her, and now she's dead 'cause of that thing. The glove stays in the safe, where it belongs. These murders are happening because of Torchwood, so Torchwood has got to do something.
This is the Temple of Five. If my parents could see this. And I'm gonna blow it up. I noticed some anomalies in the solar radiation belt. I made an analysis of the star's vibration modes. Sure enough, it appears to be highly unstable.
Whatever. I played a woman before. "Honky Grandma Be Trippin"' made $96 million. All I'm saying is, is drag is a way for Caucasians to emasculate you and make you seem nonthreatening. We never would have stopped so low on "Black Frasier." Niles, this Beaujolais is impeccable.
All right. --Now, what about Mitchell Cafferty? --Why don't you let me handle that? Look, um... Johnston, I love this town. I just want to keep it safe.
What's going on in here? Well, Mr. Mayor, let me just tell you what I found your wife doing. Jimmy, don't. Whoo... Well, suffice to say, her thong was in his mouth. Shut up!
I kinda hope we're wrong, though. Why? Because that would mean somebody's not only kidnapping Weevils, they're causing them pain. What can you feel? What do you know? I've tracked the van's route.
I didn't mean to frighten you. You can't help me either. It's okay. No, actually, my father did find a cure. It's called an Antibody. Unfortunately, we don't know where or what it is.
Now I'm gonna have to kill you. No! Hiro! You did it. You found the cure. Where was it?
It appears you have been doing most of the work for my son, King Richard. And who is this? This is Djaq from the Holy Land, Your Majesty. Interesting. You're a long way from home, Djaq. Why did you choose this particular battle here?
Your men had better get to him before Robin does. He wants reinforcements. He wants more men. He still has got no idea. He has no idea what's happening in England. The message you sent with Carter.
No one. I think it's better to have someone. Even if it hurts. Even if it's the most painful thing you have to do. Even if it's the most painful thing you've ever had to do. I think it's better to have someone. See this skin, O'Malley? It looks a little jagged.
You won't remember a thing. Ivory-billed woodpecker. I'm sorry? Ivory-billed woodpecker-- that's what's getting me through this. I'm a,uh,lifelong birdwatcher. And when I get through this,I am finally going to scout the ivory-billed woodpecker.
- I won't if you won't. Don't wait up. - The last of the ailing souls... - I told you to shut up! You know when you get a tune stuck in your head? This song just started coming to me.
- What's gonna go here? - Nothing. T.J. put those up. Yeah, didn't want to tempt fate, huh? Well, you know, he means well. He also built this coat rack lamp.
Biggest Sl... Four-letter word rhymes with... "chut. " I suppose it could be worse. I could have an entire category named after me. That hairnet... has the Biggest Geekman award written all over it. Okay, Deichman's got a lock on that.
Okay. Have a good day, guys. Stephen, what is it? That was the office. The company was sold this morning. Sold?
The questions raised in this film are urgent. Are the lives and dreams of the ordinary people of Chile, like the people of Venezuela, like the people of Bolivia, like the people of Nicaragua, like the people of Vietnam, and Iraq, and Iran, and Palestine, expendable - worth only a few seconds on the news if they're lucky? The answer is no, and those who see the world through the eyes of the powerful, should be warned. People are rising from the tyranny and oblivion to which we in the West have consigned them. Indeed, their resistance is well under way as this film has shown.
My son save me. You must come to the fortress. I need you. Kal-El, save me. JOR-EL : Kal-El, the crystal you carry was made by Zor-El .
I'm sending him home. What? No, no! No, Mom. I like Raja now. This conversation is over.
Uh. You... Really? Candy-apple red. There's that radar detector he tried to hide under the dash. You remember it? He still owns it, what, 20 years from now?
When were you gonna go pick it up? The next time Leland left town? How did you know? The night we talked, you put the pen down on the table. I remember. It rolled a little. Yesterday in your bedroom, in your real bedroom, it didn't roll.
Well, you just keep thinking about it because this is not a business call, this is personal. I need a lift to Cannes. I heard you got the last plane out of marquis and I've got to get Vinnie Chase and the Medellin crew there by tomorrow. Medellin... You know, I hear a lot of hype about that film. It's phenomenal.
And the woman I love is slipping away. I don't know if I can do this. Maybe you don't have to. - What... what is that? - It's a modified version of the memory neutralizer that I designed years ago. The original was like a shotgun, erasing short-term memory. This one erases long-term memory, but is much more precise.
He's had eight hours of normal monitoring. That's not enough. Keep him overnight. Don't tell me how to practice medicine. I am not admitting a speed freak. Can you hold it down?
- You? Why, you are nothing but an old man in a tent, sitting in rags, playing hoop-a-lou with the wind. - You wish for proof? - Aye. Pick... pick a card. Don't show me!
I'll solve this myself. Waste away in here for all I care. Aang, it's time you learned my history with Fire Lord Sozin. You need to understand how the war began if you want to know how to end it. Meet me on my home island on the day of the summer solstice. Ok, Roku. You need to know the story of your great-grandfather's demise.
Huh? Sensei? Why? He figured it would be impossible for him to ignore you once he hears your piano playing. He'll never accept that offer. I just got a message from your father saying he'd refused. I knew it.
Yes...the thing is, I wonder whether I could talk to them? Can't I take a message for you? Couldn't you put me through to them directly? No, we never put anyone through directly to the vehicles. What was the nature of the inquiry? Er... they were taking a letter up to Breidholt for me.
Do you like my mask? When did you make this? Just yesterday. I like the mask because it hides my face. I don't like you to hide your face. Take it off.
Before time began, there was the Cube.
Cody Mavencourt. And the one that rides the biggest wave wins. Are you nervous about going against Tank Evans? Ah, Tank. Nervous? What do I have to be nervous about?
You wrote to someone? I see a letter in your hands. To whom would I write, my dear? To Viscount de Prony, like you, to admonish him! This letter you see is neither from me, nor to me. It's for M. De Marigny, and was just handed to me.
Transcoder is? If you really don't know, then you're better off. Safer. If I were you, I wouldn't be worrying about my safety. Huh. Well? The Transcoder... it's a unidirectional biological encoder. A what?
No, I just need to see one file. You need to come back tomorrow morning, 8 a.m., when we're open. Sergeant! Sergeant Mulanax! Sergeant, I just need to see one file! Just give me five minutes.
No, this is where I keep all my old comics... And I wanna show you one. - You're one of those guys? - Come here. Is this a pregnant superhero? I found it in Japan when I was there with my band.
Tristan. What happened to you? I found the star. I can't believe you did it. Where's my star? Can I see it?
There's probably hairline cracks up towards the helos there. The human impacts what's happening with global warming, climate changes it is happening first and fastest in the Arctic. We're starting to see that things are happening even faster than what scientists indicated. By the end of the century, perhaps even in a few decades the Arctic will be quite ice-free. Well, climate change is going to have a strong, fundamental impact on the global water cycle. It's going to change rainfall patterns.
Scientists? We wouldn't want that, would we? Let's just hope for the best, shall we? That should be enough. Take this. It's a standard torsion seismograph.
May I give you some advice, Miss Quinn? Well, you are the one holding the gun. Life is for living. It's there for the taking. Grant yourself no regrets. Go on, put it down. You don't have it in you.
Whoops. Mum. We didn't hear you come home. This is Vlad. Plumber. Just popped in to fix the toilet.
Are you scared? I've been scared by a lot of things for a long time. She sacrificed me to protect her children. And sacrificed them to protect herself. Will the defendent please rise. We the jury find Gertrude Baniszewski guilty of first degree murder. Sentencing her to life in prison. The case got a lot of attention.
A million dead for nothing. The last days were terrible. One month before the armistice, Iraq bombed Tehran every day as if to wipe it off the map. Towards the end, the regime got scared because an opposition army had entered from Iraq. The government feared the threat posed by political prisoners. The state adopted a radical solution to the problem.
Do I detect a little note of paranoia? You don't know the corporate world very well, do you, Doctor? - No, suppose I don't. - It's not going to work. I built I.S.T. I have a game plan.
I need to talk to you all. Miss Crawford, this concerns you too. My dear, I have to ask you to be brave. I'm very sorry for it. Julia? Julia is safe with our cousins at Richmond. Last week, I received a letter from an old friend in London.
Uh, question... How do you know you're looking for a person? See, smart people remove themselves by a few degrees from inside trades... Sell through a company or a foundation, maybe. The Hadley foundation sold shares that day, Tyler. What's the Hadley foundation?
Wait... May I speak freely? You're about to implement another new strategy regardless of the human cost or the financial cost because you predict... We thought deeply about the human cost when we planned this strategy. What were your estimates? What I can say is that this strategy has patience and determination at its core.
Just get it out! Now! It's gonna be okay, Stevie. Just inject the dye. Dye's going into his liver, but it's not coming out. The clot's gonna be constricting the flow in the hepatic vein. It's not constricting it.
It's already below the stomach. It should pass on its own. Strong magnet. It's messin'with the imaging. We have no way to— You got X-ray vision, House? Oh, you gonna cut him open? Right here?
YEAH, WELL, WELCOME TO MY WORLD. YOU KNOW WHAT THE WEIRDEST PART IS? I'M REALLY, REALLY... LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. YOU GOT MY MESSAGE. I DID,
You're gonna move on that, or what? Got a present for you too. SID found your finger prints on the Garza murder weapon, - just like you said. - Who else has seen this report? No one.
He picked you two as patsies. You were perfect-- two guys who had every reason to hate the government for what happened to your fathers. And you set us up. You don't know it,but I saved your lives at the drexler. did you get out? The bomb had a fail-safe.
Coordinate with first-responders in all target zones. - Put General Walsh through. - You're on with Bill Buchanan, sir. This is Walsh. General, we've made visual contact with a single drone. We're tracking it on satellite.
- The gate ? Get us away from it. Sir, the satellite is turning again. It's hitting the planet. It's a sustained beam. That is bad for a dozen different reasons.
Well, I love it. I used to come up here every summer, helping Uncle Harvey run the place. It's all mine. It's my farm. I own a farm. I'm the farmer in the dell. - Get that tractor running.
So we're on the same page, right? - You were just being nice to Billy. - What do you mean? You didn't really like the movie, did you? I thought it was amazing. You didn't?

A sickness spreading everywhere. Infecting thousands. Of what do you speak, Papa? The disease of Lutheranism. It spreads among the poor. Those who see the church as rich and corrupt and decadent.

- Overruled. The man is an expert witness. We're entitled to hear his professional opinion. Thank you. Well, if it was human, it was nothing I'd ever seen before. Was it self-sustaining?
Won't the Germans execute workers at Aker? That is why we are wearing English uniforms. - What if we are not seen? - We'll leave English effects. - It's going to go well. - This is a limpet.
Which means... um, I, uh, I can't dream. I had this bike accident when I was a kid, And I banged my head pretty good, And I haven't had a dream since. Till the study... uh, sort of. What'd the doc give you? It's this yellow tea. It smelled awful -- Tasted worse.
- Order, Detective. Dr. Prosky suggested that I free-associate. So here I go. You know what I think about when I pull a trigger? I think about the Infield Fly Rule. I love that fucking rule.
No, really, I'm a doctor. Ah. What's your specialty? Legs. I'm a leg doctor. Well, Doc, I love this truck. I do.
Aw. That's so nice for both of you. I know it may seem strange that I have feelings for an octopus monster from another universe. And yes, perhaps it's not the storybook romance that's been crammed down our throats by Hollywood. But the Monsterpus has loved us from afar since we were amoebas. Only when the space anomaly opened could it finally express a billion years of longing. Really?

I'm working with the home secretary, and we're doing a background check on Hannah Cleary. Understand she taught there. Yes, but I'm not at liberty to say-- of course. Silly of me. How is the old school? God, I miss it.
Alex wouldn't say much about it. But it was eating him up. It's such a waste. Alex would have been a wonderful teacher. What part of "confidential source" don't you understand? What do you care where the tip came from?
No, their names weren't in the safe house. Andy's was. - What computational error? you put the bishop on e6 to begin with! - You asked me to teach it chess- - I taught it chess.
He was a hero. "Listen," Kyle said. "Listen and understand. The machine is out there. It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with.
"Listen," Kyle said. "Listen and understand. The machine is out there. It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear.
Someone staying in the loft? Yeah... good old Sam, back at the loft. You don't say. Yeah. I'm gonna go, mom. That store there...
Are you serious? You can't be serious. I wanted other things. I don't understand. Well, one day you're there... and then, all of a sudden... there's less of you, and you wonder where that part went, if it's living somewhere outside of you. And you keep thinking... maybe you'll get it back.
I say let them have it. Thanks. How are you, Don? Henry. Sit down. Can I get you anything? You know, I'm glad you picked this place.
Women have feelings about these women because men do. Because we want both, they want to be both. It's about how they want to be seen by us... their husbands, their boyfriends, their friends' husbands. Here's the idea, very simply. The bra is called the Harlequin. In fit and form, it should be your very best.
- No, after my tongue has swollen to the size of a brisket! All right, just let me get my keys. Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God! The laundry is out of the hamper. Okay, Sheldon, what was it supposed to be? Fine.
- Because I was busy. I was turning over rocks, trying to get a bead on that son of a bitch. He just bought a second house in Catalina. And a new BMW, and look at this. He's got two offshore bank accounts on a Sheriff's salary. Randy, this guy is dirty. I can smell him. What is it? This one's been repainted. Recently.
You want to know what I found. Trippy. I like it. I was able to extract an undiluted sample from inside the needle shaft. And voilà, I give you the blue-ringed octopus. A what?
His ghost appeared every night in the lab. The teacher told me to clean the aquarium. That night I remembered that I hadn't turned on the pump. But I was too scared to sneak into the school at night. So I asked Donkey to turn the pump on for me. Donkey, please!

Which plant? That plant? - Yeah, that's the one. - Lovely. That's the printer there? - By the plant, yeah. - Brilliant.
That's the printer there? - By the plant, yeah. - Brilliant. Does it need a code? Last place I worked, the printer needed a code. No, I can do it from here.
Partners in crime. And evidently off-worlders, judging by your sonic technology. Oh, yes. I've still got your sonic pen. Nice. I like it.
The island was about to have a visitor. Sorry. Desmond. Her name was naomi, and she claimed To be working for penny on a mission to find desmond. Oh, my god. I understand your helicopter crashed onto the island.
No? - No. But if I might beg the wisdom of the gods before we perish. Once this new race of creatures is complete, then what? My masters will follow the example of Rome itself, an almighty empire, bestriding the whole of civilisation! But if you've crashed, and you've got all this technology, why don't you just go home? The heaven of Pyrovillia is gone. What do you mean, gone?
- No. But if I might beg the wisdom of the gods before we perish. Once this new race of creatures is complete, then what? My masters will follow the example of Rome itself, an almighty empire, bestriding the whole of civilisation! But if you've crashed, and you've got all this technology, why don't you just go home? The heaven of Pyrovillia is gone. What do you mean, gone? Where's it gone?

I understand this is hard for you. Just do me a favor and go to the hologram room. Why? Just do it,please. All right,I'm here. Well,activate the hologram projector. There's no power.
Press hard. You have nephroptosis. Also known as "floating kidney. " The kidney is like a chandelier. It's attached to a ceiling of intestines and blood vessels. But your contractor, I think you know who he is, he hung it with a cheap chain.
Stop or I'll shoot. No, you won't. You're a security guard. Come on. That gun's just for show, innit? Do you know what a bullet does to a living person? It's not like a knife through butter, no, no, no, no.
- I'm not an alien! You're good, I'll give you that. But I'm not! Yeah, and the Lone Ranger didn't have a thing with Tonto. Does the shape-shifter copy smells too? No.
A different piece of the puzzle. Something you didn't want connected to the map at all. That is downright scary! Maybe you really do have a gift, kid. My bad for doubting it. Now, this key is also from Bouchard's stuff I found in Argentina.
Okay, bye. Look behind you! Is there a cigarette? Yes. Get back there. Throw it out the window.
It's 4:00 o'clock on a Saturday. I, uh,... have to count the atoms at the nuclear plant. Conservation of mass. It's the law. The load is on the road. This episode's gonna be great.
Is he going to be okay? Well, he's lost a lot of blood. Well, for what it's worth, the knitting group at St. Alma's added him to the prayer chain. Your mom knits? We all knit eventually. Listen, I just took a message for you.
Stop it, she's my friend. Now, open the door and let her out. - This is Time Lord treachery. - Hey, the doorjust closed on its own! Nevertheless, the Tardis is a weapon. And it will be destroyed! What are you doing?

I'm working on it, Gibbs. Did you call Ziva? Not answering, boss. Okay. So this one... No-brainer, easy to match. I've always really liked this color.
I know you have the device. And all of the pieces are in place. Now it's up to you. If you really believe I have this thing why don't you just take it and do it yourself ? Apparently , the orb was built to protect the human race. So only a human can use it.
Now you sound like white people. - I misinterpreted the rules. - I misinterpreted the rules. What the hell do you mean you just put my penis outside? Why didn't you call me? Look, Garrison, my wife didn't want a penis in the house. I had to get it out. Well, now how am I supposed to find it?
Can I see your badges? Of course, sure. Fine, so you're cops and morons. - Excuse me? No, no, we're very smart. The liver was not ripped out.
What the hell are you doing in here? Forensics? On which case? The new bean counter is questioning this lab request. What is this key that you're testing? It's, uh...
You want me to call for an evidence truck to come down here? I may have a car with clean paper. Today's your lucky day. See that Lexus? I need to unload that. Straight up trade, no questions asked.
-No. But it's a mind. Talk to John Henry. The Al communicates through images. Symbolistic responses. We thought about using a natural-language interface but decided against it. Too creepy.
The truth? In the near future, a computer system called Skynet takes over the world. It sends humanoid machines back in time to eliminate anyone who's a threat. I have a target list. Your name is on it. A machine is coming to kill you.
-Here it comes now. MORRIS: The van? EILEEN: It approaches from the left. We climb inside the van.
Assassin, this is Godfather. How copy? Solid copy, Godfather. Outstanding fire mission. Stand by. Listen, this town is just up the road.
- All we saw was camels going down. - Camel killer. Look, I didn't mean to shoot innocent camels, all right? I'm sure I shot people. Shouldn't you two be doing the after-action report on Alpha's failedrecon mission? What's this about you losing your kevlar?
Perhaps you can drive me to the airport? That's some kind of code for you,isn't it? Maybe I should take him. No,I'll take him. What's this? Look,it's been... very interesting working here,but... I'm a man of science, and this place is just...
Have you never taken anything that didn't belong to you because you knew it was the right thing to do? This isn't about me. Maybe it is, Peter. You took the cylinder. Do you remember that? Yes, of course.
That's enough spark to ignite a gasoline vapor. We're looking at our murder weapon. I'm gonna print this. Calleigh, I just got a hit off of the rigged cell phone from the Escalade. It's Sam Laughlin, the valet parker. We found this custom trailer at your place.
Who says they weren't haunted this whole time? Maybe they just dealt with it better. No. It was new for grace. She was scared. She kept asking what a ghost could do.
You seem a little distracted, Mr. Adams. I had thought that you were with us. As I am, as I am. But not enough to come out and say so. Politics is the art of the possible. What did you get by opposing the motion?
No. For what you did at school. I wanted to help you. Where's this bra from? It's new. Where did you get the money for it?
Apparently high-society formals don't go with the whole Brooklyn artist thing. Well, it's an acquired taste, to be sure. - Um... You still going? - Absolutely. Something I love about the Snowflake Ball.
Are you--are you punishing me? Jordan wasn't the only person in that bank. As for nate, I'm sure someone has told you that subarachnoid aneurysms are hereditary. It's nate or me, isn't it? You recused yourself from the position. You wanted to have a normal life again.Wish graed, but-- no--n-not nate.
You're an inspiration. That's great, but I'd like to do the scene As it was originally intended, as it's supposed to be. Actors and their words. I understand. You'll have your words. You'll do the scene as written?
That's just the first offer. It's not 100, it's 100 against 300. ##against? What does that mean, against? It means if the movie gets made you get another 200. If it gets made?
That was unkind to my dick. I had to get you back for ruining my bush. Well, I've known the guy for like six weeks now, the only genuine moment I've had with him is when he told me about a woman he never got over and a Mustang. That's why I was snooping around your house. I think you'd have better luck finding the Mustang. Why is that?
HE SAYS THAT THE CASTLEMAN CONTRACTORS SPOOKED AND STARTED FIRING. 5.56 NATO ROUNDS... MIXED IN WITH SOME 9 MILLS FROM THE SUBMACHINE GUNS. INSURGENTS WOULD HAVE USED AK-47 WITH 7.62 AMMO -- HAS MORE OF A "CRACK." CONTRACTORS SHOT THEM UP, ALL RIGHT. YOU I.D.'d THE WEAPON FROM THE GUNSHOT SOUND.
ONE MORE. MAYBE TWO. * OF YOUR NOVEMBER DOWNTOWN * I BOUGHT A PLANT. NICE. TEAM SPIRIT.
What brings you to this dark corner? I had another dream. I see. I saw Arthur lying under water, drowning, and there was a woman standing over him, watching him die. And she's here. In Camelot. The mind plays tricks.
Exactly! There is so much joy in this machine. Joy is not acceptable. Don't you see? My mind is stronger than you ever thought! It dominates, sir!
Why would Dooku want to set a trap for his best General? It doesn't make sense. Are we the bait, or is Grievous the bait? We must consider who this trap is for. General, your droid is tracking an incoming ship. It matches a description of General Grievous' fighter.
Not long after the war broke out, he was accused of treason. His entire estate, Swiss bank accounts, holdings, were nationalized. A clever SS accountant- well, I thought I was clever at the time- was put in charge. He was meticulous, which is how he rose so fast through the ranks. But this one file, he put aside. In fact, he stole it.
U.S.Marshals. So why'd you call the marshals, detective? Well, we got two dead kids. We have a girl named sienna burke over there. And a boy with this in his wallet. And this.
- Really? Yeah. It was nice to meet you, Shmuel. And you, Bruno. Bye. Mum, I can't find my football.
Stop being such a stepmom. Where'd you get this? It was Dad's. Yeah, I know. Where was it? I found it in the downstairs bathroom.
You're surrounded by hundreds of soldiers. There's no leaving here. I have done nothing wrong. You invaded our airspace. That automaton that emerged from the sphere, it attacked our troops. It acted to defend me.
Guys! Guys! Guys! Guys! The blood trail ends here. What do you mean?
Hands together. Shut up! Go. Asshole! You said you threw the gun out. -A good thing I didn't.
The 3,000 manatees left in Florida are one of the last surviving sirenian tribes in the world. But for how long? Every day, human development takes a little more of their habitat. Soon, they may have nowhere left to live. The orca, or killer whale, is the king of the ocean. It is the largest of the dolphin family.
- Okay. Okay. In a hostage situation, any idiot can steal a gun and start shooting. It's a great way to get a bunch of innocent people killed. Keeping people alive means fighting like a spy. Where is your data server?
I'll talk to her myself. Sorry for interrupting, senator. We have a subpoena for jack bauer. He's being questioned by the united states senate. We need mr. Bauer immediately. The cip firewall protects every major infrastructure system in this country.
There's been another attack? Not yet,but they believe the CIP device is being utilized. We have to assume Dubaku is initiating another attack. - Madam President. - What is it,Tim? I've just been forwarded a scrambled call.
The lab found Godshaw's DNA on it. That is fantastic! Yes! Oh, look at that. I found the spoon. It's not silver.
Did your dad take you here, too? So I can't ask you anything after all. Okay, anything except about the old man. Look... The peacock has the most beautiful feathers, the envy of all other birds. And it knows.
She only shit the pantry once,god damn it. I-I'm pretty sure it was more than once. Ok? I'm holding this dead dog... and I look up. I see this liquor store across the street. I mean,it's glowing.
Miss Beldon, Sofi wanted you to have this. In case anything happened. Thank you. Dear Casey, it has fallen upon you to finish what began in Auschwitz. Be careful. The dybbuk feeds on fear. It has a taste for our family's blood now.
And what else are we spending 5 bob on? What else are we spending sixpence on? Oh, nothing! No! Nothing. All of this is free. This vase is free. It was, actually.
Jenny. Jenny! It's an old map. A Speed. The poor dear didn't even know what it was. What a waste! It shouldn't spend its life on a wall in wherever the hell we were.
-David, what are you looking for? -Um, just... What are you doing? Will you marry me? What were you looking for? I thought I had a ring.
At least he didn't mention it. Yeah, well, you have to be careful. Sometimes they put you in the trunk of a car and you can't breathe. I'm not... I'm serious. I told him your theory about capital punishment. What did you say?
Peach Melba. Oh. Who makes up these names? Mr. Massey names all his paints himself. Well, it's a beautiful color just the same. Oh, and doesn't it bring out the pearl in her skin? Right.
- Hi. - Hey. - I fixed the garage door. - Great. Yeah. One track was bent.
Or rather, one cell of a battery. Here. Cut up the last two sponges. Remember the electrolytes? Well, think about it. A battery is a galvanic cell.
Are you crazy? I'm being rehabilitated. Aren't we rehabilitating? Just outside Paris, they spot the radar, slow down. All of a sudden, the car breaks down. It glides along a little.
When he watched me do my training he looked at me so affectionately. I always had that impression. Don't talk anymore. You're wounded. The bullet went straight through. It doesn't count as a wound.
Now just fix the hem. And this time, try not to leave the edges frayed. Hey, Edie! Wait up! Now don't forget, the clasp is broken. I'll replace it.
- Excuse me? - No, excuse me. It's just that sometimes my thoughts come so fast that I get confused. Sorry. From now on, I'll say a line, and all you do is repeat it exactly. The film is impotent.
If they weren't, there'd be no inconvenience. Do not try and force me to choose between my child-- I'm forcing you to do your job! If you can't also-- Fine, you want to separate a patient's central nervous system from the rest of his body. If the pain stays, it's in his brain.
Maybe that's just the social contract. You tell me I look great. I tell you you're a people person. How can you know the truth? You could ask for the truth. What do you think of my nose? Please tell me the truth.
I'm guessing you also cured his ear problem. Did you give him the money yet? I was right. And more satisfyingly, you were wrong. It was a coincidence. The cat was not predicting deaths.
Why'd I think that? S he never ever apologized. S he was like me. Alright. There's something we have to settle. While discussing important objects, I put Anne's marble on my desk.
All assassinated the same time they tried to kill Jack. Andrew Staines, Ellen Hunt, Michael Sanders, mean anything to you? No, nothing. We need to get inside Whitehall. Have you got the I5 software, Ianto? Yeah, it's still on the site, why?
They are servants of Sauron, and he seeks the Ring of Barahir. Father, they are hunting for you. It is as I feared then. I beg you to hide the ring. Do not wear it! No.
She's the second colleague I've worked with that was murdered. The other one was Jenny May. We were trying to stop the traffic in Russian dolphins, and it involved a hunger strike. About the tenth day, I passed out, and I went to a hospital there, so Jenny became a target, and they followed her down the beach and strangled her with her own belt. These dolphins are symbolic of a new day for the environment. It's all about respect now, not exploitation. I feel somewhat responsible because it was the Flipper TV series that created this multi-billion-dollar industry.
It's-- It's unbelievable, really. Even though there's obviously no words spoken, you really feel like you're on some level communicating with them, like there's an understanding between the two of you. I don't normally touch anything in the water, but I just thought, you know, it had been swimming with me for so long, I put my hand out in front of me, and it rolled right into my hand, and it just stayed there in front of me, letting me rub its belly. Here you have this dolphin, wild and on its own terms, come up and really seek out affection and touch.
and now, he has left his cave, his mind bent on recovering it. Gollum knows, doesn't he Gandalf? He knows the location of the Ring? Yes. Unfortunately our secret is no longer safe, the foolish Hobbit revealed his name. It should have been destroyed.
-God's. We were made in God's image. This body was made to resemble a particular human. This body appeared in Red Valley, New Mexico, in 1999. It had a different appearance then. In 2007 it kidnapped Dr. Alistair Fleming and forced him to regrow its organic covering.
It's not that kind of voice. It's not like a voice in my head. Someone came on the radio, said that the people that killed my sister were coming to kill me. I'm not crazy. Did you recognize the voice? No, I didn't.
I know that's what his wife thinks. Sir, please, can't we just bring him in here and ask him where he was the night his sister-in-law died? What do you mean, no one asked him that? No one has asked him anything. No one thought it mattered. In the past 24 hours, a theory of evidence has emerged.
Look, let's just blend into the crowd. No, we can't go that way. The door is locked, Michael. Stand back. This whole thing is falling apart. Is it?
There's kind of an elemental quality to it. Ultimately, anybody could crash on an island like this, And the idea of being surrounded by strangers Is sort of readily identifiable. I don't know your name. I'm kate. Jack. Did anybody see that? Yeah. E island is a mysterious place.
-A squidman named Cuch. He killed Abin Sur? With a smile. [ARGUING IN ALIEN LANGUAGE] I don't have this place in my files. It's called Labella's.
Let me have a look now. - Breathe deep, your majesty. Good. - Lady mary. - Yes, madam. The box.
Since I'm an admirer of Ingmar Bergman I've recently seen one of his classic movies: There's a very disturbing sequence where one of the actresses mutilates her sex with fragments of glass and then she shows it to her husband saying "no" to him. That's undoubtedly violent, but it belongs to art just like the paintings of Goya or some of Baudelaire's poems describing cooked fetuses eaten during some banquets. Art has no limits towards death. Even when in cinema an already dead animal is used to underline human cruelty. The movie received lukewarm reactions.
I didn't say, "What was her name?" I said, "What is her name?" Is, is. See, I said, "Is. " You heard me. Game over. I win. Have you even seen this show? Yeah, it was good.
You want love. You want-- - I want a quick word with you privately. - I'm in the middle of something. - It's very important. It's about your boat. - My boat? I don't have a boat.
Heinrich such beautiful words you have just said of the soul and such I think I already like you very much Heinrich The philosophy of the people, my dear child does not serve to console the weak.
His name's jonathan Carver, a man with the right clearance at the right company... and the only employee who doesn't have a family, a dog or an A.D.T. Account. Thanks for making it easy on me. Actually, I understand he's a bit of a gun nut... which means he's less likely to call the cops and more likely... to just... shoot you. So good luck with that. You have a car repair kit? A tire iron is great if you need a new tire.
And he's planning something... bigger. Any guesses what his plan might be? No. I don't know. I don't want to wait to find out. You know what the Talmud says? "If someone's coming to kill you, get up early, kill them first."
I'm the one who should be doing it. And besides that... it's not good for you. What is this ointment made from? Growth proteins. Antihistamines as well.
And he keeps wanting me to take photos of us on my phone. Look. -Oh, bless him. He's doing that... -Yeah. MKOMBE: Guess who? Um...is it Mkombe?
Okay, enlighten me. After James Dean died, his mechanic bought the wreckage and he fixed it up. And it repaid him by falling on him. Then Tony McHenry was killed when it locked up on the racetrack. I mean, death follows this car around like exhaust. Nobody touches it and comes away in one piece.
Ooh. Oh! Aah! Sorry. I think my arm is broken. Relax.
How did you do that? I-I-I didn't do anything. I have--I have to go to work. This is all your fault! You did this, the three of you! I can see the cone of power.
It's a bio-chip. Technically a brain-computer interface, or BCI. This particular chip has a transmitter, which makes it wireless. So it can commit the brain to a remote computer? That's right. From what we can ascertain, we think it works a lot like a pacemaker.
Jack! Peter, he's plugged in. Let me try to shut down the program. November 822 to ATC, I've got a problem! I'm gonna have to try to disable the server. Can you shut it down?
The woman... What does she look like? Man, I'd like to see her face, too. Hey, wait! God damn it! I don't care!
Bye. Imagine that each letter had a number in this alphabet. A is one, b is two and so on. We can apply plus one. A becomes B, B becomes C. Then comes the hard part - and I've transferred it to this machine.
What if his last living act was to donate a part of his liver? Not the whole thing, just one small piece. Then I'm not defiling a dead body. House. The last generous act of a living person. House, it's too late. The liver started to degrade.
What have you been up to, mate? I've been working on my new song. That's good! What's it called? It's called "What's The Point?" Sounds interesting.
I'll take it back to the lab,run some tests. You don't have a lab.You have a storage unit. Semantics. Thanks,moz. white collar Season01 Episode03 The bible belonged to the church of saint camillus de lellis in naples. It was brought here in 1903.
Kind of gross. You're making me wonder if this pizza is worth the 22-hour drive. Just like old times! I feel so young again except for the chest pains. But the crust is so good. What is the secret to this crust? It's no big secret.
Why should I? Because you don't have a choice. What is it that you wish to know? What is the Crystal of Neahtid? To those who know how to use it, the crystal holds great knowledge. What kind of knowledge? The knowledge of what is, what has been and what is yet to come.
They can't understand what you're saying. You, you, you - don't move, I'll kick the shit out of you. Shut up! Where's the laptop? On the chair. Easy, calm down.
You must be tired. Oh no, the journey was very pleasant. I would like to introduce ambassador Snaut to you. Good day. This creature here is covered by a coral. It uses it as a protective cover and as a weapon.
It's pointless. I'll do something. I can't stand it any more. I'm afraid. I don't know what to do... I often have this dream.
I was standing right next to my son. Suddenly, I felt something hot come down on my head. I felt tingly all over like someone was poking me with needles. Then my boy said: "It feels hot right here, Mom." Then the cancer vanished.
It's what gives all matter mass. The thing without which we could not exist. You're talking about the moment of creation. Yes. In a way, I am. The antimatter is suspended there in an airtight nanocomposite shell with electromagnets in each end. If it were to fall out of suspension and come in contact with matter say, the bottom of the canister, the two opposing forces would annihilate one another violently.
Habakkuk and the Angel. He's the prophet that predicted the annihilation of the earth. "Let angels guide thee on thy lofty quest." This is the first marker. The path is alive. Southwest.
Yeah, I will do all of that in the morning. No, now. Now, as in- - As in- - As in now? As in not now, as in right now. Shaw, the storage yard is halfway across town.
We're getting out of here. Frak me. - What? - You're not gonna believe this. Based on the co-ordinates we got from Sam... we've determined that the Cylon colony is located here. It's within ourjump range, but there's a sizable catch.
Of the treasures are meant to be Kept within the clans. (Mai) Oh. But I can tell you a little. Okay. The Yasakani no Magatama was created By my ancestors. Almost 2,000 years ago. At that time, the necklace possessed... The energy to unlock the door.

The battle of censorship will not be finally settled by Your Honor's decision, but you will either add to liberal, educated thinking, or by your decision, you will add fuel to the fire of ignorance.

Maximo. We're fine, Max.. We don't need anything. I brought a hot cucumber. What? I boiled it for two minutes.
A rest rises up to meet their chest so they're comfortably carried. They'll be very calm. Nature is cruel, but we don't have to be. We owe them some respect. I touched the first cow as it was being stunned. In a few seconds, it was gonna be just another piece of beef, but in that moment, it was still an individual.
You gotta embrace the cliches, Jess They are the bread and butter of all valedictorians. And that is why you are not valedictorian. Jess doesn't need clichés. The speech is gonna be epic. Epic?
Yes. Oh, yeah, they're both gone now. Funnily enough, I was thinking about him on the way down. I looked out the windows when we were in Lincolnshire, I saw this fucking tree. It rem...

And those inputs would be different every time. I mean, each robot would be unique and uncopyable. That's not really my point. See, my point is that a robot could benefit from being in the real world. You know, let it out, explore, get it out of the lab. Uncopyable.
Lacy, stay. Come over here. I got something I want to show you. This big enough to hold whatever you're hoping to ship to Gemenon? Yeah. That'll work. Look at the tag.
Okay, so you just put a bomb in a hotel just like that, Like washing your car? I was gonna turn the job down. But this guy's nuts. He's grade-"A" psycho. You would like him. This device - How's it set up? It's airtight.
What are you doing here? You're needed downstairs, Agent Romeo. Wow, she seems really into you. Agent Miller has been working undercover for the CIA, playing the girlfriend of suspected arms smuggler, Karl Stromberg. We've learned ten million dollars was recently wired into Stromberg's account. We don't know what this weapon is, but someone's willing to pay a lot of money for it.
He manipulates. He's humping her? Oh, Daddy! I'd rather not know. In my opinion, it's a not new situation I found this. The bitch!
But Dad, the earth turns. So those stars there go to France and become French. No. Stars travel abroad but they don't like it there. So they turn around the earth all day and return to Belgium at night, to sleep. What? I'm putting the moon inside.

Let's go find the other people. Nobody's supposed to make way. It's hard to believe he was ever this little. Three years is a long time. You don't like the vacuum sweeper? It just makes such a racket.
The board of directors are going to try to vote me out this week but i've got an insurance policy that's gonna keep that from happening. This is a receipt from the airport bar for 7 scotches. Drinking keeps me warm and approchable. Oh here. It's a map. My mentor who ran this place before me left it to me in his will.
There's nothing I can do, Mr. Crisp. I don't like that memo anymore either. Way too many people are having fun with my name. I'm surprised it took this memo to get that train out of the station. Look, I've had several complaints, but the company is not going to admit it made a mistake. What if it didn't have to admit it made a mistake?
-Shut up. -Don 't fucking piss me offi. -Stupid idiot. We're almost there. Shit, fucking road. I'll fuck up my car. I hope it's worth it.
- I'll get some wine. - OK. Yes... these are God's children. But they have lost their way. And we cannot simply award this deviant path by allowing them the sacred sacrament of marriage. And they think if they can twist enough arms in the political arena that they can win this... prize. But marriage isn't a prize, is it?
- I hope she left trail of breadcrumbs because if she didn't, we might never find our way out. Oh, I'll be leaving these woods... Ah! ...but you won't. [GRUNTS] Look, the legend of Siobhan McDougal is just a ghost story.
I've showered. Now I'm hungry. You smell like lemongrass. - My shoes? - No, your body odor. The soap is old-style. Good.
We just need to find out who they're protecting. Is that MacManus? M-a-c? Yeah, just try all the variations. They always mess it up. Oh. They're calling this operation olive branch. H-hour is midnight.
I can't even sense where the portal is. Whatever magic allowed you to pass through this rock is beyond my powers. If you can't get in, what about the spell of taking? It doesn't work on living things. I can't use it to get you out of the valley. No, but you once used it to take the Sword and compass from me.
Did you? Larry, did you call the cops? Oh, shit! I'll call an ambulance! I told you three times today that the screen pass was a bad idea. It wasn't working!
Chelsea, you're really freaking me out here. I've got to go. Come on. Wait. Oh, I found your mustache. Where was it?
You know, "Scrabble, just knock it off:" She got like that toward the... end. Got obsessive about stuff. Just got mad about stuff. We didn't know what was up. It wasn't like her to be that way. But it turned out that the cancer had spread to her brain and that was why.
- Roger! Get him out of here. The rest of us are trying to build something. He's right. Where would you hide a coin? You'd spend it, wouldn't you?

It made sense. Three weeks ago I was on this rooftop and I opened a portal using the Book of Rao. If the darkness came through a gateway, maybe it can leave through one. I've used my bracelet before to open a portal. This dark force is like a disease. How did it become so powerful?
If the darkness came through a gateway, maybe it can leave through one. I've used my bracelet before to open a portal. This dark force is like a disease. How did it become so powerful? It can see your thoughts and feelings. It can find the one morsel of doubt that even the purest person doesn't realize they have inside them.
Euro-guards! Take him away in Euro-cuffs. Wait! Not so fast! We found something to save Krusty! And it's on this DVD.
Row 16. I think it's just up ahead. Should be back to the boat in about 10. Be careful. We found the container. And what was in it? Nothing.
It does make things more interesting. I want you two to cover the other end of the case. Agent Williams was investigating a rebel group in Chechnya. He suspected they were buying small arms from a corrupt source inside the Navy. And how far are we away from fixing that file that Williams sent from his PDA? Uh, we're moving slowly but surely.
Identity was a concern, so they handled all communication electronically. It's a risk we're going to have to take. Works for me. Not you. Just like old times. The service road from the south is the likeliest entry point.
Thanks, Roy. Break it down. Window, screen wall. Bedroom, bathroom. Even if we get eyes in... The front door opens the wrong way.
Okay? - Good night, Stefan. - Good night. MRS. LOCKWOOD: It's good for Tyler to have you in the house. - I appreciate that, Carol. - Hmm. Oh, and I can see if I can dig up that stone you're looking for.
- Come. - No, what about the moonstone? What do you know about the moonstone? I know that you need it. And I know where it is. - Yes? - I can help you get it.
I got a chubby man with a gray beard making a call, Michael. You don't have much time. There's a lump of plastic that used to be a laptop. Somebody definitely set up shop here. I got a resin mold here. Looks like the guy tried to destroy it before he took off.
The result was the global recession... which costs the world tens of trillions of dollars... rendered 30 millions people unemployed... and doubled the national debt of the US. If you looked at the costs of it: the structure of equity welth, of housing wealth... then the structure of income, of jobs, 15 million people globally... could end up below the poverty line again. This is just a hugely, hugely expensive crisis. This crisis was not an accident.
Grandmother said, "Child, you will see the man you love under water." I had a big brother too. They shot him. The murderer is still a free man.
If you had listened to me from the beginning, We wouldn't be in this position. Take his weapon. There can only be one commander, And Kiva's dead. Any objections? What do we know about the planet? Not much.
Look. There they go. Honey was considered so sacred as a gift from the bees. The honey was not sold until the end of the 19th or into the 20th century. Most of the honey was given away as a gift. It is one of the most beneficial and healing substances that we can imagine.
I didn't just move in. First we had to iron out a few details. "Roommates agree that Friday nights shall be reserved "for watching Joss Whedon's brilliant new series Firefly." Does that really need to be in the agreement? We might as well settle it now;
She seems to like him. She seemed to like the last one, too. So you played baseball as a boy. Do you still have your mitt? What? No.
Majesty, I fear to say that I am already scraping the bottom, and a good companion of Your Majesty, a fellow of trust, seems certain to have betrayed Your Majesty... committing adultery with the Queen, your wife. Who is he? Your groom, Thomas Culpepper. So far, both of them have denied the charges, though neither of them denies the many illicit meetings they had on the backstairs and in the Queen's stool closet during Your Majesty's last progress. Lady Rochford and other maids of Her Majesty have come forward with corroborating evidence of their frequent intimacies. Finally, this letter was discovered in Mr. Culpepper's chambers.
All right. Really, it's gonna be fine. I'm all over it. Chance is all over it. We're both professionals. Yo! You want to, uh, grab my battery?
Yeah, a guy like you needs his space. So, we heading to the Bureau? I got the FBI on board with Caffrey, but you? I don't even know your real name. And I've looked. Thanks for the pen, by the way. What pen? I got...
What? He found a trace of semen inside the victim's vagina and a finger print which he missed out in his initial autopsy. What does that mean? He said there was no evidence of rape... Even if there was semen, doesn't it belong to Lee? The blood-type of the semen's donor is the rare RH-A type.
I like you, too. And I want to be close to you. Grubbs is on tour, right? So you need a bartender. Alex, your movie just blew up. At the festival.
- Me either. I thought he'd pick you. - Yeah, me too. Although I kind of panicked and thought it might be you. That pie smells really good. It is really good.
- These are numbers. - Yes, I know. Here, the line across the man's eyes, it's the Chinese number one. And this one is 15. But what's the code? All the smugglers know it.
G.D., barbecue, then the bridge, then my jeep. Where's Cafe Diem? Shut up. And then Henry's garage. G.D. Was the last place hit. We've been thinking about this all wrong. The weapon isn't the source of the events.
Now, all I have to do is find that thing. I'll try not to disappoint you. Diana, I can't thank you enough. You will always have a home here. Alura. You once asked if I could remember my mother's name.
There's plenty more where that came from, at the precinct. And I see you didn't get a chance to clean your shoes either, huh? - That's not why I went there. - Really? ! So you didn't go back to the memorial to finish up Toby's handiwork? Or were you just there covering up his tracks? I found it like that.
But, uh, below perfect. Say hello to the brand-new Italian reading lamp that you've always wanted. What's wrong with my old lamp? I just... I bought that three weeks ago. You discovered it at a flea market. Do you like it?
Seems to be a great deal of interest from international arms dealers who haven't attended in past years. Royce made his billions in shipping and mining, not arms. Maybe we should notify NSA. I'll brief them. We have to act quickly. Surveilling this conference is gonna be difficult.
Of course it's his. That dick is a magic marker. Hooman has a crayon. I took him to the baths. That rude asshole never even took off his Bluetooth. No, no, you're not accounting for edema.
Well, not the now you. The messy-haired mug shot you. Well, I don't know. I thought it was such a great idea For you to go live with your grandfather. Yeah, don't buy back the sale here, burke. But I completely understand your decision.
- No? They just want to kill you for no reason? They think they have a reason, but they're wrong. Five minutes with you and the pope would find a reason. I told you, okay? I didn't steal anything. I was hired to deliver a box... as specified, unopened.
Right. Put all this shit in that skip. Would it kill you to dress it up a bit? Put all this shit in that skip, please. Sometimes I wonder if you take this job entirelyseriously. I'm 1 00% committed to your ongoing rehabilitation.
Come with us, quickly. Hell no. I'm just getting started. Sweet. What the hell was that? Why was she wearing the suit?
I'm just getting started. Sweet. What the hell was that? Why was she wearing the suit? It must have slipped onto her at some point. Probably looking for safe harbor.
I was running, trying to clear my head, get everything out of my system... Something made me turn back, and there was a car coming straight at me. Did you see the driver? The headlights were in my eyes. How about the car? Could you make out the model or make?
Do you have enemies? Not any more. How can I avoid having enemies? Tomorrow you'll hold court for the first time. What should you do? Tu'an Gu. Yes. What is this virtue they call benevolence?
Not any more. How can I avoid having enemies? Tomorrow you'll hold court for the first time. What should you do? Tu'an Gu. Yes. What is this virtue they call benevolence? It's one of the highest moral virtues.
- We got it. Phone the neighbours. Wake the kids. Kick the dog. Remember that muddy female boot print outside Tilden's house? Yeah, we found it.
- Should we take it? - No. He'll know someone was here. This is just a fact-finding mission. I think we know what the facts are. There's a way to do this. It protects you.
My name is Thomas K. Rhumor, and I have proof that Truxton Spangler is manipulating intelligence at the American Policy Institute. Happy? Katie, none of that is important. I hope you never have to worry about any of it. I'm sorry for what I may have to do, and for what you may one day discover about me. Commit this address to memory.
Besides, this girl wasn't even raped. So, what do you think, copycat? Yeah, maybe one of his crazy fans. When Reed got off the prison bus, you notice him carrying a duffel bag or a box or anything? No. I mean, if he got fan mail in the joint, left it behind, where do you think it would be?
I was afraid I'd ruin your surprise. Might as well tell you now. I wrote down the whole story of the day you were born. That's the gift I had to wrap. Really? Yeah. You can read it if you want now.
Um... 11 of these men paroled in the early nineties have the exact same last known address. A cluster of pervs? That rules out areas that are near schools and parks. Housing options are limited, to say the least. Guess that makes sense. The cluster would be the one place they feel safe. Garcia, what's the address?
Yeah, that's the ending to a whole other story. We'll get there. So you really thought I was gonna kill you? Well... ish. Oh, Ted, that's ridiculous. If I wanted to kill you, I'd invite you to my hunting lodge.
Gesundheit. Here's the deal. I was in a situation, gallivanting through the forest. I came across your tower and... Where is my satchel? I've hidden it. Somewhere you'll never find it.
This is why you brought me here, Dastan? Mystical devices? Do you remember, after the battle, you stopped Tus from taking the dagger I'd won? That dagger is the reason he invaded Alamut. This dagger, you have it with you? Yes.
Here's who you drew into this, Perseus. An honor guard. Young men who look good on a reviewing stand and old soldiers, heading towards retirement. Do you know what the Kraken is? The Kraken is the end of us. A colossal, elemental beast.
And about that kiss, that's... You know, I don't do that. I completely sensed that, yeah. So... I just wanted to clear the air. The air is cleared.
No way. The second emperor of the Han dynasty locked his least-favorite wife in this urn for 10 years to the day. They say you open it up, the same thing will happen to you. I'm sorry. I'm looking for this note. Have you seen it?
They say you open it up, the same thing will happen to you. I'm sorry. I'm looking for this note. Have you seen it? It kind of just blew into your store. A note?
Sorry, I forgot your education's somewhat lacking. Yeah, I prefer to go more by instinct. You know, what feels right. Very good. Well, the Parasite Spell is a rather nasty piece of business. It originated in Haiti, if memory serves.
That's for you young man! I passionately believe it's the growth of small businesses into larger ones... that is critical for Britain's future. It has to be something icy on a stick for Denis. That's the only way... we will produce jobs, real jobs, jobs that sustain. The Trade Union Movement was founded to protect workers. Now it persecutes them.
We are tracking it with our submarine HMS Conqueror. Is this ship a threat? Both of these ships are carrying Exocet missiles, Prime Minister. Just yesterday... they launched, then aborted an attack inside the exclusion zone. There is a risk they could try it again. The Belgrano is sailing directly away from the islands.
The garden? Why? I'm sick of screwing in the open air. This tiger wants a bed. Don't you like it? You're hurting me.
- Is that a chair? - Yes, it's a Chintoko. - Really? - There's only five in the entire world. Sit, sit, sit. - Yeah, okay. - I love it.
I am not a sin. Sire? Sire? Your engineer, sire. The mine is ready. Will it work?
- A crusade? - Yes, Father. Using the cross to incite hatred and anger- that's Christian? Well, maybe not. But, Father, the government is openly attacking the church. No, it isn't.
That was incredible. - Let's saw something else in half. - How about your finger? My finger? It's okay, the saw has a safety device. It detects moisture.
ARTHUR: No! Unh. Ow! [NAOMI CHUCKLES] So this must be a fun job.
Henry's her only hope for a better life. If you love her you'll let her go. We've all seen the bones on the trail to Mount Grimmoor. That's where the wolf makes its lair. BARKEEP: We know the weaknesses of the werewolf.
John? - Hello... - Hello? Yeah. Are you sure it's not unplugged again? you don't wanna cancel your policy.
- Yeah. - I didn't realise it was German. do you think I'm stupid? Look at me. Look at me. Why would I have bothered to take this thing? What am I supposed to do with it?
What the hell is going on, Nathan? My parents' murder, everything we have been through, it's all about a damn list. - What list? - A list of names my father stole. This guy Kozlow came after me, thinking he'd force my father to give it back. The crazy part is I have had it all along and didn't even realize it.
This is real, the cold. That's real. The air in my lungs. Those bastards out there in the dark stalking us. It's this world that I'm worried about, Talget, not the next. What about your faith? What about it?
-No. - And you? Only by rewards. We can go to a site, where can think a little. Who wants to fight? I hope that the row with Paul was not something serious.
Okay? How's this? "Dear Claire, I can't work the bake sale because you're a bossy control freak who look down..." Very funny, Jay. Ay... ay... why the whoosh? Where is... where is the e-mail?
It sended! Ay. Make it come back. I don't know how to make it come back. Now she's gonna read it, and she's gonna think it's from me! Well, technically, it was from you. But come on, let's hit the road.
There's no sign of a driver. You know, maybe there's a number we can call. - Whoa. CLARK: Chloe, look. I got a text message from last night. And it's from Lois.
Afghanistan. And here are the targets. And here is a tracking history. How long does the residue last? A few months, a few days. We give the residue the half-life we want.
Minimal activity in the stable neocortex. Anger isn't the answer. Loneliness isn't the answer either. Perhaps fear... Show you a movie. It's one of my favorites.
Anger isn't the answer. Loneliness isn't the answer either. Perhaps fear... Show you a movie. It's one of my favorites. It's called Jaws.
Oh, it'll just be a minute, I promise. I mean, he's right there. Don't even try to tell me you're on an emergency ibuprofen run. I'm not sick. The slap was a nice touch... Oscar-worthy.
Look, I just have a common cold! It'll be gone as fast as I can sneeze, hurl, and squirt it out. No, it won't. The common cold died out 500 years ago, and subsequently, humanity lost all resistance to its ravages, but the virus survived in you, frozen for a thousand years. Huh, so it was hiding deep down inside of me, like my skeleton bones? Give it to us straight, Professor.
No, it won't. The common cold died out 500 years ago, and subsequently, humanity lost all resistance to its ravages, but the virus survived in you, frozen for a thousand years. Huh, so it was hiding deep down inside of me, like my skeleton bones? Give it to us straight, Professor. How incredibly deadly is it? We don't know.
-Well... -How could you? Isn't a carnival a good idea? Bakhtin... You think I could have done such a thing to you? Right, but it was thanks to Bakhtin that I cooked it up. He demonstrated how the carnival is liberating.
Go on, make it up. Make it up. More. What does that mean? It means my tongue comes towards you. Slowly. It slithers across the floor.
Make it up. More. What does that mean? It means my tongue comes towards you. Slowly. It slithers across the floor. It slips under the bed. It rises up the side of it.
More. What does that mean? It means my tongue comes towards you. Slowly. It slithers across the floor. It slips under the bed. It rises up the side of it. It reaches your feet. It licks them.
Poor thing. I mean, she wasn't young, but still... Thank you for telling me, Denise. I know, baby. That smell never went away. It came with the car.
I mean, hello! My, my own mother took a shot at you. Hoyt, we need to talk. I found this fuckin' doll on the bed again. I thought you said you got rid of it. I did. I threw it in the lake.
May we be of assistance? Please bring Miss Lane's car inside and repair any damage from the flight. That key can't be safe. Why don't you give it a try? [LOIS GROANS] I carved it out of a piece of dwarf star material.
Yes... Paul had no choice but to punish his wife... I love you. Because some lies... are unforgiveable. We are reminded every spring... with every rose that blooms, with every sunflower that blossoms, with every lily that buds. The world is a beautiful place.
Oh, yeah. I hope it cheers him up. I'm sure it's just what the doctor ordered. Well, I wish I could do more. Oh, Susan, you're doing more for Paul than you can possibly know. The Grand Canyon.
What happened? I don't really wanna talk about her. So, what happened to you? What's your story? It's complicated. It's complicated or you just don't wanna talk about it?
Come on, a cop? You know, I'd appreciate it if you'd replenish my supply when you diminish it. I'm wallowing. Word on the street is you went to Randy Morosco for information. Well, a unique black-market pigeon blood recently made its way to New York, and none of the local shops have anything like it. No one would try to sell a stone like that without cutting it first.
What's happening? Must have been some kind of power surge. Is it still transferring? I don't know. The mainframe is inaccessible. Anything?
MAN 2: Move! As you requested, Mother. [SOFT PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] I first heard this music on Earth. No, I didn't hear it. I felt it. I carried it around in my head.
How can I find comfort if I don't have a soul? Ryan, you do have a soul. - How do you know that? - You wouldn't feel this way if you didn't. The soul is what lies beneath. It is the core of all humans.
Just like if he were my own. Hanshiro. Please forgive me. Do not say such things. Please open the door. I'd like to see the fortress.
He had a gun. Well, maybe he was afraid people heard them fighting, so he took off. Plus he was shot, just wanted to get out, treat his wound. You own a green BMW? Yeah. Why?
- When did you graduate? Have you ever heard of a boy named Nick Baldwin? Congratulations. A colleague of mine just told me something that I never knew before. There is no such thing as a bonsai tree seed. Instead, you take the seed of a healthy tree and infect it with a fungus that genetically alters it's root system.
Tell me. How many sons sprang from your father's cock? Five, Domina. And from his father before him? The same. Your subligaria.
Especially in the presence of a man loyal to the House of Batiatus. And what would brave Solonius do in my fucking position? ! Turn blind eye towards the murder of his father? ! He would be certain to strike appropriate target. What if Tullius had no hand in this? His gift of wine was tainted with death.
And he enjoys it. He just didn't know it at first. Elian is an angry child, but he would not do this. Please, let me find him before it gets worse. Thank you for your help. Your head is spinning because it's full of ghosts. You think you can do this work day in, day out and you don't carry it with you?
Some senior citizen and a lifeless kid? They fit the bill. No one will care if they go missing, plus they're neck-deep in debt. Show me the cargo. It's already loaded. Hey, hey, hey.
Sometimes... things have to fall apart to make way for better things. We're done here. Okay, you don't have to hold back anymore. You may now say what you really think of Zoey. I don't know, she may have been right about that lion's head. It gave The Arcadian a regal elegance.
[SHOVEL digging] Tell me where you buried the blanket!
One should approach it with extreme circumspection. As one should approach you, perhaps? He is learning to mean what he says! But as to war, see here. My new invention. If it works, it will be... truly grisly.
- Della Rovere. -... Gloria Patri... You will fight like dogs over this corpse I leave for this throne of St. Peter's. But it was pure once. We have all sullied it with our greed and lechery. Which of you... will wash it clean?
Ready! Come on, damn you! Yes! To the victor, the spoils. Did you plant that tree? Steady on.
You don't sound very enthusiastic. Are you? - Can we stop for a minute? - Don't tell me you're tired. I'm not tired. I'm hot . This tweed is too thick.
To sabotage the reactor at the Concordia site. Make it look unsafe so the humans turn against Concordia. You must stop them. Why? Blue Energy has two forms. In its stable form it powers reactors.
However, I checked the operational expenses for London. There's an ongoing charge, not assigned to an active op or agent. It's a shipping container. Protocol for a cleaner in a foreign theater is to establish a storage space. Shipping container is a default option. Container A-541.
What's all this? This, is the backbreaking work we've been doing, while you were getting takeout from your stupid Chinese bank! Every single one of these has to be wiped, reformatted, the whole shmeel. What? But it's just a little cartoon pirate! Was.
I swear... The more I know people, the more I like animals. And my Vombrator. "Vombrator", what's that? My Vombrator... is this! A 100% French tractor! Those English pieces of junk don't even have a patch on it. Sadly, it's given up the ghost.
There's a rugby match in Sauvadieu. And they don't have a fly half... And sir here could do it. Oh no... Oh yes. A rugby team... is like the Foreign Legion.
- Sure. - The woman was Kira Solari, right? - I think so, yeah. - Was it on TV? - No, no, no... Not here.
So full of dreams. And all the time in the world to make them come true. The night Brother Sam carried Nick from his apartment... Nick fired a shot at him. From the couch, I'm guessing, since he was stoned. So the bullet should be here. 9 millimeter.
Tell me why it matters if a person is good or bad. Does it make you feel better to kill bad people? It's part of the ritual. You don't need a justification to kill. The code is more than that. It's kept me from getting caught.
Where's your mom? Not here. Things would've been good if we hadn't had you. If you weren't around... I spent so much money on you! I could've sold this shack...
Not here. Things would've been good if we hadn't had you. If you weren't around... I spent so much money on you! I could've sold this shack... It's Mom's.
Come on. Come on. Work, damn it work! Have we a problem? Come on! The worm!
Here you go. State of the art. And semi-portable. Gateway computer. I haven't seen one of these in a while. Still works great.
At those prices... Not a chance. You don't want to miss your plane. Right. If you're still sitting in the box, then you will be serving on this jury. Now, I can see this trial going one of two ways.
Looks like we're gonna need some more garage. - Or a full-time valet. - What the hell is this? Melody said you weren't in school and now I know why. - John: It's a gift, Regina. - Oh, this is going back.
But after it runs, you and I both know it won't much matter. We're done here. I don't take to extortion. I'm not going to be bullied by an ambulance chaser, no matter how nice the suit. It is nice, isn't it? Italian.
And the guy would like the option to literally get down on his knees and beg her to give him a second chance. If you would have stopped talking and just gotten on your knees, I probably would have said yes, but.. Stop, please. I forgive you. You do? So that means you're willing to give me another shot?
-Well, not as good as you obviously. -What's this about? -l'm getting married. -Shut up. -Really. This ring is pretty amazing.
Previously on "the Vampire Diaries"... The only thing stronger than your craving for blood is your love for this one girl. Your humanity is killing you. Turn it off. No!
I think it's more than fair. Yes! Yes, yes. It is, if what you're saying is true. It is, and all you have to do is sign on the dotted line. What a lovely quill! Wherever did you get it?
It's a lot like Avatar. Like what? Avatar. It's a movie? Okay, okay, so there's this guy in a wheelchair, and he goes to this alien planet to join a program... So you pick a dragon and get to keep it forever?
Come on, come on! Hey, honey. Dad, there's some freaky dude at the door screaming about money. I think he might be one of your patients. I don't know, should I call the cops? No. Just... just keep the door closed.
you have to call off the hit. You'd risk Michael's life for that? Michael will be fine until I get up there and I break him out. Maybe I wasn't clear before. When I said I had Michael, I meant it. Right now, a predator drone is circling the compound.
Stop fighting it, just give in to it. I don't know why I'm quoting a rapist. Can't we just stay a little bit longer? We don't have any A.C. at home. I have an A.C. you girls can use. You have an air conditioner that works?
Hey I'm Chuck. Here are a few things that might need to know or maybe you just forgot. - Why'd you bring us here? - I need you to do a job for me. We've been tracking a computer super virus named the "Omen." Bring it back to me, Mr. Casey goes free. The virus is too dangerous to be released into the world!
I went to her Facebook page. It says she was tear-gassed and possibly beaten. I haven't been tear-gassed in so long. Well, you're on a new path now. Oh, goody, a new path. Is it lined with credit cards and flat screen TVs?
Hurry up... Aya... I'm so sorry. I couldn't save you. You were the one, who saved me. My body...
Damn it. Okay. The internal iliac's retracted. I need to stop the bleeding. We're gonna have to clamp the vascular supply proximally. There's too much blood. I need you to clear the field. Damn it.
You're not taking it out? It's too risky. If we go outside of the track, we could hit healthy brain tissue. Come on. Take the probe. Hold it still.
Like the way a battery stores energy. You'll see it all the time in places like prisons or asylums. Negative energy feeds on trauma and pain. It draws those things to it. The force here in this house is larger than the many individual traumas. And it has a need.
You'll see it all the time in places like prisons or asylums. Negative energy feeds on trauma and pain. It draws those things to it. The force here in this house is larger than the many individual traumas. And it has a need. It wants to break through.
Negative energy feeds on trauma and pain. It draws those things to it. The force here in this house is larger than the many individual traumas. And it has a need. It wants to break through. It wants to move in our world.
The Pope's box? What the hell are you talking about? When a new Pope has been chosen... and the bells of St. Peter's chime he is shown into a small chamber next to the Sistine Chapel. They call it the Room of Tears, named for the sublime mixture of joy and sorrow that he must contemplate at this moment. He is brought a key to this box. It has been said that this box contains the ultimate secret.
What'd we do? Before we divulge any information, we have to know who we're talking to. How'd he die? Gun, knife, beaten to death? We're still trying to determine that. Well, you can't tell by looking at hi we wanna see the body.
Your eyes overcompensate for what your ears are missing. That said, I do know a 3-year-old boy that once met a friendly apparition named Leverett Saltonstall. - He was nice? - Very nice. You'd think the laundry room would be closer to the dorms. It's not in the basement?
The students here mean well, they really do. But what Greendale has always needed is a miracle. This is it. This is how I get to put Greendale on the map. You know, I thought this commercial was going to be okay. Well, guess what?
Believe me, this world will crumble. It can't go on like this. What would you have instead? You shouldn't laugh. It's no laughing matter. But there's no need for you to take it all as a tragedy. This place is unbelievable.
Where you going,anyway? Find owen. He's on the trail of another black box. Anti-inflammatories. We needed the data on that box. You shouldn't have destroyed it.
Look, I... I came into some money. I want you to have this. Half a million dollars? I have a favor to ask you. The past is a tricky thing. Sometimes it's etched in stone.
And you believed him? Daniel? Charlotte. Daddy,I can't live with her anymore. It's okay. this seat taken?
- That is not the right approach. - Then what is? To enter into their game. I have the advantage over my adversaries in that I know what cards they hold whereas they are oblivious to my hand. Do you see this spider's web? Big, isn't it?
At Chasseloup-Laubat College yesterday, Gen. de Lattre, France's High Commissioner to Indochina, spoke confidently to Vietnamese students. Be a man! If you're a communist, join the Viet Minh. There are men there who fight hard for a bad cause. But if you're a patriot, fight for your country. This war is your war.
I baked this cake for you. Thanks very much. You're my best friend. You're my only friend, Margeir. Won't you put a candle on it? Of course.
Find someone else, Matrakçı. Come on. Is there no one who will play matrak with me? I won't take too much of your money. Neither the light of the sun nor the shining night stars ease my bleeding heart. How many times has the crescent moon become the full moon. But you are still not here. The marble balcony is cold.

Is there any return? Is it possible? Returning is not a skill it is a necessity, İbrahim. You are beautiful, my Sultan. You dazzle my eyes. Is the table ready?
We'll see about that! Ta-da! Benny. What do you think, Lady B? This baby is fully equipped. Equipped for what?
Plane? No, no, I'm a naval man myself. I never fly if I can help it. He's got me confused with someone else. What is this peculiar liquid? There's no bouquet.
Look around you. Who do you fear? Can you see a face? A uniform? A flag? No. Our world is not more transparent now. It's more opaque.
Well, you should be. These men are ruthless and vicious. Give me my sword and I'll leave this place. And go where? Anywhere my hands won't be used to make tools that kill anyone. This place is not so bad.
This is just like your initial logo, only now it's awesome. This has nothing to do with my original logo. My logo was an eye that was watching over the neighborhood. I don't know what this is. A tiger with wings? Exactly. This is a tiger, who's fierce and sleek. But it's got wings, so it flies above the neighborhood.
It's bullshit! You tried to hang me with your belt! You told me to! No! You told me to! Look at my neck!
Is that what they say about me? It's just that no one ever sees you. That's a beautiful necklace. Reminds me of one that belonged to my mother. It can't be the same one because her pearls are in this safe the manufacturer clearly explained is uncrackable. Oops.
I know. I want to be sure we're still working towards - I think I may just have found the painting your wife craves. The rarest Winslow Homer the world has yet to see. I have it at home in storage. I came across it under the most unusual circumstances.
We're still settling in but I got new curtains for the bedroom and I ordered a... Oh, son of a bitch! You know what, I gotta go. Give Dad a kiss? Okay. My cactus. It's dead. So we'll return it.
Darkness. That's the first thing I remember. It was dark, and it was cold. And I was scared. But then, then I saw the moon. It was so big and it was so bright.
That's the first thing I remember. It was dark, and it was cold. And I was scared. But then, then I saw the moon. It was so big and it was so bright. It seemed to chase the darkness away.
Look at this. It's a swimsuit! Mud tracked all over your floor by uninvited guests? Well, the Thneed sure comes in handy for that! But wait, there's more! Thanks to its all-natural microfibers, the Thneed is super-absorbent!
- Are you O.K.? - Yeah. Yeah? I'm sorry, love. I'm Camilla. Noel. So what sort of a business did your mum have then, Noel?
You're an accountant. Do the math. If every infected person fed on or infected the rest of the people, the entire population would've eaten itself off the planet long before Christ was even born. Only a stem can turn someone. Is that the sweater Tepish knit you? Mm-hmm. It would be impolite not to wear it.
Guess what I did. A cat used to come to our garden. One day, I took the quail from its cage. I gave it to the cat. It carried it off to a corner to eat it in peace. I followed it. But the cat turned on me.
Name it. You reinstate me as Head of Nuclear Research, so I can finish building my bomb. Deal. One last thing. You will let me build a round nuclear weapon. Never.
I have to be back at the palace in an hour. Zoey thinks I'm at yoga. I have great news. We are just days away from testing the new missiles. I have re-engineered the oxidizing ducts and the payload delivery systems. But you'll be happy to know, the missile is now pointy!
No, this one. You are powerful! Is there anybody better? No! Thank you, Scott. Your donation was more than generous.
My menstrual cycle started back up again. Stop. What? And I don't even have a uterus. I mean, I have it. It's in a jar.
Everyone who took the Soy Sauce is either dead or comatose except for me. Probably able to adjust. But you should have figured out by now, you don't choose the Soy Sauce. The Soy Sauce chooses you. The Soy Sauce chooses you. If it can't use you, it kills you.
Mrs. White? Are you confirming? That little bitch. Do you have my ring? Well, may I have it? Pretty.
What does that mean? It was a couple of hours after the sun went down. It's time. Oh, my God. There was a bone. A forearm, I think. Maybe it was a shin.
Why are you talking to my college roommate? We're Facebook friends. Oh, my God! How do I eject? Why do you have flames on your laptop? It's a gaming laptop.
No, nobody has to do anything by themselves. You don't have to do anything by yourself either. Dr. Ling was right. I didn't wanna listen to him at first, but I see what he means now. You're turning evil. There is nothing evil about wanting more. There's nothing evil about that teapot.
Congratulations Morland. Tomorrow a raid at the gypsies. Case solved. According to witnesses, I can find Barberis... Not bad for an office guy, huh? Sorry, not just the head works...
And there's nothing you can do that will make me change my mind. This isn't about me. Do you realize how many people will get hurt if this gets out? You need to go. You've already complicated things enough by being here. This whole thing was supposed to go off without a hitch.
Twelve hours of cannon fire. Could I perhaps sleep through it? If Your Highness puts wax his ears. The fever returns? It never leaves us, Catherina Sforza. But the smell of battle will be its own medicine.
Oh, you surprised me too. You were so brave with that whole Belle initiation. You helped me with my fertility situation even though you didn't have to. And this is seriously the best night I've had in ages. The movie, the wine, no coasters. And this pizza is incredible. It's frozen from the Dixie Stop.
Uh, I mean, uh -- Listen, I got something that smells like you boys. A body turned up in Canton, Ohio. Local P.D.'s trying to bury the story and the body. Okay, um, so, uh, what's up with the body? Well, when it went missing, it was a perfectly normal grad student named Charles Durbin.
You invented the free will unit, then you selfishly hid it beyond the reach of my stealers. Thanks to you, I went on a soul-searching journey. I hate those! Now, give up the free will. I should have destroyed it, but I was too damn proud of myself. So I kept it around, never letting it out of my sight.
A-plus. And that idea is called the anthropic principle, That everything happened just so that we could know it happened, But there's a problem with the anthropic principle. Ashley... What could be wrong with this idea? It assumes we're the end. Yes.
Doesn't seem to be connecting with the Smart Dust there. Oh, there's some sort of crosstalk interference. Only one other thing uses the same Gaussian wave packets. Oh. Let me guess. The missing control unit. I had this happen! I had this happen once with a garage door opener.
Lay off Angel, we were doing just fine. What the fuck was that? They're here... The aliens. Has anyone ever seen the sky like that? No.
Now hurry up! Ji Ben, are you bothered that I'm doing your job? Chancellor, I'm shocked that you'd ask. Your hands are much more sensitive than mine thanks to your condition, so I'm more than willing to leave this to you. To see an old affliction become a cure, and your tender care for her, how can I not be moved? Ji Ben, let me see your tongue.
Or that I had any friend who would be a man for my sake! But manhood is melted into curtsies, valor into compliment, and men are only turned into tongues, and trim ones too. For he is now as valiant as Hercules who only tells a lie and swears it! I cannot be a man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving. By this hand, I love thee.
These are both for the same woman? Well, they're both so "us." I see. Well, you're fortunate you have someone that loves you. I really am. Love, it's like a delicate flame.
We mine the diamonds that get crushed into dust that give light to the world. You and your seven brethren will bring joy to yourselves and to everyone. Come on. This is your team. These are your brothers. Everyone, grab an ax.
Because you don't have it in you. If you did, you would have done it 28 years ago, when I brought you here. Because you know if I'm dead, you'll never get back to your daughter. And I have a way for us to both get what we want. My hat. I want you to use it again.
Mom! -Wyatt? -You're ready to go. Voilá. What, honey? I can't find my tiger! Where'd you put it?
From a Shell station just outside Towson, Maryland. Kurzweil stopped there every third Thursday of every even month, even if he'd filled up the day before. On three of his 18 visits, this SUV was present two hours before. - A dead-drop. - The SUV was registered to the wife of a Turkish oil executive that paid for plane tickets used by an Iranian suspect in the bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires in 1994. The thinnest thread connects Kurzweil and his contact and the machine could see it.

Where's the donkey? It ran off. You moron! You can't even handle a donkey! I wanted it to run faster, so I smacked its butt. But it was startled.
Just a few more feet. Because if it's a 3-way, I gotta warn you, that's how I met my ex-husband. Uh, no, it's not that. Your fish. You're getting rid of it? Well, I know how much you hate it.
I'll lose my job, my career... and probably even Harrison. So what, then? Travis is dead. - Nothing's gonna change that. Maybe we should just get rid of the body. - What?
Did your daughter tell you why I'm here? Yeah. So I guess me question to you is... at the party, did you... did you have sex with me mum? Yeah. About the sex... was it normal? Hmm, it was on a washing machine.
I shouldn't have brought Sam into this. [Chuckles] Last time I checked, you don't give work assignments and Sam is pretty kickass. I'm sure she can handle herself. [Scanner beeps an alert] Oh, my God, the anomaly, it opened. Toby! Dammit! Closed again.
- Mrs. - Florrick, one more time. While working at his firm, at any time, have you and Will Gardner engaged in a sexual relationship? Yes. Is this sexual relationship still active? No. When did this relationship begin? In the spring.
Please. Go away! That move you put on the DB? Come on, you were zigging and zagging like a rastafarian. A move like that needs a name, dawg. Like hell!
Now I know you know this, Shawn, but I have to ask. You didn't drink anything or eat anything? You said not to, so I didn't. Okay. We're gonna go through consent one more time. This is your arm. Your tumor is right here, near the shoulder.
You didn't drink anything or eat anything? You said not to, so I didn't. Okay. We're gonna go through consent one more time. This is your arm. Your tumor is right here, near the shoulder. It's stage III. It's pretty big.
You recognize these? - The gamekeeper's antlers. - Why'd you take aim at these? - He shot my dog. - It was running loose in the woods. Why don't you give me the gun? How'd you get it anyway?
- How do I know you will let me go? - I give you my word. You're not of any value to me. I could shoot you right now. All I want is the code. Give it to me and you're free to go. Oops. Pick it up.
And in this, lies the only copy of the code. Your soul. I want you to take care of it. - Yes... - Thank you. But I have deleted the last sequence, and without it, it's useless. And that's yours, Leo.
I heard gunshots and I went to the water, and Tyler was lying there. I thought it was you, and then I heard Charlotte and Declan, and I... panicked. Well, so much for your stand-up image. You were just gonna let 'em fry me? I told you, I don't know who killed Tyler. But I do know one thing for certain-- the bloody hoodie they found in Lee Moran's car didn't belong to Lee Moran.
The man who awarded you $25 million? Isn't he one of the judges you introduced to bookies? Objection. And weren't you confronted about this at the grand jury? Excuse me, Ms. Nyholm, you have referenced proceedings that resulted in a sealed transcript. Yes, but Mr. Gardner can answer to his own testimony. This question requires your knowledge of the grand jury investigation.
The burglary gone bad, which every other paper in town seems so ready to print... I've got the lead detective ready to go on record, say the whole damn thing was a cover-up as long as I pay for it. Now I'm not exactly ready to bite that fucking bullet, but, goddamn, I mean, we've got him. - We've got Kane by the balls. - We? Yeah, you told me Rosebud was Stone. I did not.
Damn. And if they're here... They're gonna be everywhere. The temporalis muscle is atrophied. Any idea why, Dr. Grey? Uh, lack of use?
Let me go down there. You? You're their enemy. Division agents only respect what they've been made to fear. They've been made to fear me. My fight was never with you.
Huixiang... Let's steal a boat and go sailing. Honestly, you and Nan... Look! What a lovely sky! Look at it!
Like Japan. You know, I don't believe you. And, you, you're a part of this. See this -- all this? It's not just any zombie movie. This the original zombie movie.
- I think I rather be grounded. - No, it's important that you come. Important to whom? To me. All right, listen to me. When you were 4 years old, you came home one day with a cat.
Not as much as Matt. Oh, Christ! And plaid? What is he thinking? ! Let's just hope he doesn't see this. This hummus is wonderful.
Hope that saves his soul. Thanks for coming... bringing this. Anything you need, Mom. What's so urgent? I got a little disturbing news the other day I wanted to... bounce off my Mexican brethren. It turns out there was this RICO case, right?
I don't want there to be any confusion. My ability to keep you from harm will outweigh your comfort. Do we have an agreement? Sir? Sir? The abduction was unexpected.
Well, the paint from the other car is supposed to be... It's dark brown as per Ms. Thomas' description. But there's blue and white paint mixed in with the brown. Means it's brown now, but was originally painted white and blue-- a very distinctive white and blue as a matter of fact. Detective Bell. We are looking for a decommissioned NYPD van, presumably sold at auction, then painted brown.
But we don't know what it is. FOWKES: No, but we have a fair idea where it is. In that case that he gave Dave Ryder. That bloody case. Curse of my life. You need to find it.
Major in astrophysics. Says you were with her last night. So work must not be the only thing that's kept your mind off the separation. So what's your point? You asked me if the machine was capable of learning human nature. I'm saying it already is.
The Wallbanger, in the city. Noon tomorrow. We've got some catching up to do. Finch, looks like Wyler's past has come back to haunt him. You'll have access to all the camera feeds through your cell phone. And this alarm system, does it call the local police? No-no, no.
- Really? - You're his penis doctor? - Yes. Because that's what an urologist is. Oh. So my penis is fine, right?
So before that happens, I want you to tell me what you think you saw. Go and look. We did look. Now, Frank says you claimed to have seen... some sort of creature that was alive. Maybe it escaped on its own. I doubt that, Sister.
Cats don't, like, um, play possum, do they? Not with what I gave it. Okay. Ready. Bring me the cat. What's supposed to happen?
Akira Kimura. He was somehow connected to my case on Roth and Flynn. The guys who came for the coins. Yeah. God knows those coins aren't healthy to be around. And we did a little more digging, found out Kimura is tied to a secret organization called the dragon's tongue. It was founded in 1901, connected to the Japanese imperial army.
Trains are rented for prices which they could be bought for. The state buys trains from Siemens without the appropriate network to use them. It also pays contractors for works that are never delivered. There is a certain deliberateness. We degrade our national wealth to slander it after its degradation, and convince Greek public opinion that maybe a private company .is a far better solution for the Greek railways. In the name of rationalisation, the government further degrades the railways.
Unit five that is planned to be built in Ptolemaida has a budget of 1.5 billion. The whole company will be sold... for a price lower than the cost of one of its units. The Greek people paid for the electricity networks to reach even the smallest villages and these networks will now be exploited by private companies. Most of these private companies feed off the state and earn instead of offering. The public power company was not built by the private sector. It operated for 60 years thanks to the public's money.

- You okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. Just get her out of the barn, it might bring her back to life. James. James, it's gonna be all right. The barn saved you last time.
When is Serena gonna be back? Miss Serena? I haven't seen her all summer. I really appreciate you taking the time to meet with me. Yeah, well, it's nice to have someone else asking the questions for a change. Plus Professor Peiser taught my favorite journalism class at Columbia.
Full immunity from all charges, both past, present and future. - Hey. Dean, come on. - You feel that? - There's a stream. - Go on.
There was some on the stairs and in the living-room too. What happened? Why did you throw away the mattress for the sofa bed? If it was because of the blood, I'd have done it in the morning. I did it much later. That's what you say.
Water under the bridge. Which, coincidentally, is where I had to park my car. Well, I appreciate that. And, uh, just FYI, pigeons nest under there. My car already looks like it's covered in mashed potatoes. I'll get it washed for you.
She can dive right from the gene pool to the cesspool. My mother is my family. My mother... is always watching... like the "Mona Lisa." Like the "Mona Lisa" with a lot of expectations! You look pale... (Distorted voice) Like "Mona Lisa." (Voice echoing) This business is my namesake.
I'm sorry. He's just a little scared. You're damn right I am. - You don't screw this up. - We won't. Dr. Ross, you'll make sure that the liver gets here?
In both of these killings, and in last night's murders, the slugs had the same distinctive dent on the case head. It was caused by some sort of defect in the gun's barrel. The grooves and lands show a steep twist to the left. See for yourself. Now, you can wait for the computers to confirm it if you like, but Wade Crewes lied to you about that murder weapon. He didn't dump it.
You can lie all you want, Sean. It'll be easy enough to establish paternity. Okay. So what if he is my dad? How did you find out? My mom kept a diary.
You have your official face on. So what's my surprise? Four organized crime members of the Rulanti family were arrested today for the attempted murder of the head of the Spolarno family. And? And not one of the arresting officers was able to tell me where the tip came from. Maybe they didn't know.
Do you mind telling a true story? Better take care of your house than painting this old tub. It's your ship, mind you! Here's your ship certificate. The elders say, someone has cursed the sea. That's why it retreated.
- That thing! This thing? What? Did you see it? I don't think so. Oh, you'd know so.
That scene exploded in Japan. "T99" or "Quadrophonia", you know ... Hold on, I think we blew the fuses. Something others were afraid to do. A thicker sound was a better sound. It had to bite you, get to you.
I'll take you to the hotel, we'll go get him later. Just a moment Just a story Just a happy love Nice, huh? I like this song. Me, too.
And now, again. In my youth, I courted war. War hasn't started yet. You think you could make Loki tell us where the Tesseract is? I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield.
Fuck. That's not good. That's not good. Jay, you fool. I say unto thee, the power of Christ compels you! Does it?
I don't want a word of this out there until the adoption is complete. Not a word. As your lawyer, I'm legally bound not to discuss it. I know, but, you know, in casual conversation. No one... I mean, no one has ever been closer to me than this young man. I want to make sure he's taken care of forever... no matter what happens to me. The coat costs $300,000.
Harley, where is he really? Just look on the screen and tell me where it is. It does say Miami, Florida. Okay, first things first, I need the armour. Where are we at with it? It's not charging.
I can still see him, the last of those magnificent warriors, standing on a pile of his own. And he looked at me. And I will never forget those eyes. His eyes were just like yours. The planet was Furya. I know what it's called.
I lead a very quiet life. It gives me time to think about things. I have this clock at home that always helps me think. It's a piece of ormolu. Did you ever hear of it? It's golden, French, 1800s.
- Jean. - "Jean." Why don't you stop wasting your time? I'm just a lowly factory worker. That suits me fine. But you... You have a gift.
And maybe because God is on your side right now. So go before he changes his mind. How you say "crazy" where you come from? We say, "Gift from God." Kolyma, get up! The river is flooding.
You won't even know you're dead. And this isn't good, right? Because you want to be the one to kill me. Strange. After all this time, whenever I think about you, Xenya's ribbon. I found it in Aunt Katya's toolshed.
Mr. Wheatfield crossed it. On horseback. Two days ago. It's raised five foot since then. Mr. Wheatfield crossed it. If the bridge was just up.
It's been one hell of a morning. Yeah, we're going to sit down, okay? You want details? This thing's huge. This is the biggest spider that I've ever seen, maybe the biggest spider on record, and from the look of the bite that it gave that mortician, I'd say this thing is highly poisonous, aggressive, fast, smart. It's strong, really strong.
But Dad... How do you recognize it in winter? Told you 100 times. I can't remember. When the ash tree was created... it made all the other trees in the forest jealous, because it was...
I'm sure you will find your tree. You too! Dr. Clair this time, you can't stop me. And what is the reason behind this embargo? T.S., do you know where this smell of those marvellous sausages comes from? It's from a smell factory, on the New Jersey Turnpike.
But before that dawn the dark forces, the Dark Elves, reigned absolute and unchallenged. "Born of eternal night "the Dark Elves come to steal away the light." I know these stories. Mother told them to us as children. Their leader Malekith made a weapon out of that darkness and it was called the Aether. While the other relics often appear as stones the Aether is fluid and everchanging.

LoJack. Foreigners, they can't say J's. MARISOL: And they say it's at a hotel. The people at the hotel gave us a story about you and another man and her, all sexing together in a pile. It's disgusting. But to answer your question, the Lo-yack is an excellent product.
Seventh Brother, Sixth Brother, you keep guard here. Yes. Fifth Brother, tend our father's wounds. Let's go. Father. I'm going to pull out the arrow now. Don't touch it.
Can I still talk to you then? No, the opium does dull the senses. Then I respectfully decline your generous offer. I fall off the ladder. The ladder? The ladder my soul must ascend to heaven.
Madam Zuleika, or Romany Lee, Gypsy Queen? No one likes gypsies round here. Better make it Madam Zuleika. With a snake around her neck. Snake in the grass. I had a snake once.
Has he a good heart, a gentle hand? I'm to be his wife. I only want to know what that means. Bring me some cheese. The cheese will be served after the cakes, my lady. The cheese will be served when I want it served.
Okay. Good bye. Ms. Mochizuki. Where is the camera? Let me see ix. Later.
Five, ten grand a year, and I'll set you up with a nice diversified package, low risk, high yield. I think Claire and I have things pretty well under control. If I brought a senior U.S. Congressman into the fund, that would really up my stock in the company. What're you all gabbing about back there? We were talkin' about the old library. Yeah, what's happening to it?
Long as there's no teeth. They're not gonna let this end. Not now. Yeah. Well, I'm switching you to buckshot. Yeah. Doesn't have the stopping power of a 12-gauge, but you seem comfortable with it.
And somebody is making sure that no one believes me. If we're to prove you didn't commit these murders, perhaps we should consider how you could have. And then disprove that. If you are this killer, that identity runs through these events like a thread through pearls. Cassie Boyle would have been your first victim. You said her crime scene was practically gift-wrapped.
You know. I knew you'd find out. When did you find out? - 12 weeks ago. - 12 weeks ago? Lung cancer. You don't smoke.
Oh, God. Hello? I'm in here. Got your babysitting duty, huh? Yeah. You mind if I have a quick word with your prisoner?
Or a Picasso. The painting of my cock should hang at the Louvre. They should study my cock in art classes, spend whole courses studying the splendid contours of its exquisiteness, don't you think? They should also study my cock in science class cos it defies nature. My cock is hard. It's metal, it's steel, it's titanium.

They should also study my cock in science class cos it defies nature. My cock is hard. It's metal, it's steel, it's titanium. It does not break.
It's metal, it's steel, it's titanium. It does not break. It does not weaken. My cock can stand all day like a good soldier trying to impress his superiors. If my cock could win a medal, it would. If they could name a school after it, it should.
My Nobel Prize-winning cock's like a cheetah, all sleek and dangerous and deadly. Sonnets should be written about how dangerous my cheetah cock is. Poems, plays. Wars should be won over it, kingdoms fallen because of it. My cock is lightning. It is fire.
I just wanted you to know that I have always had a crush on you. I temped on your desk years back, and I thought about telling you, but then you got fired for the masturbation video, and I missed my chance. If you have a moment, I'd love to suck your dick. [Groaning] Why did you even do the movie? It was such an epic piece of shit. [Chuckles] Crazy Little Thing made close to $300 million worldwide.
You're covered in nuts. Let's give them a little something... Hold still. I love this place. Hey, to this... to this place. I don't feel it.
They got messed up Who gave you the whole script? I dunno My agent sent it How did he get hold of it? What's the problem?
It was a sign from God. The tulip was important. I took it from the other timeline, and kept it. When we devised the plan to stop the invasion, you didn't think we could succeed. You doubted yourself. I knew the tulip would give you strength, as it had before. It was your symbol of hope and absolution.
They serve to stabilize each end. And one will remain here in our present as an anchor. The other one will be sent to a specific point in the future-- 2167. How do we get them to 2167? That's what the magnet is for. It's used as a launch platform.
There was a fight. Barton got the bottle, and... Oh, he buried him in lava. The bottle? What bottle? This old copper jug.
We all good. I'm not your wife. I threw my pie for you. The head should pass through your body in three to five days. Unless you start vomiting or have severe cramping, it's best just to let the body eliminate this on its own. I'm gonna have to shit it out.

If it made it down your esophagus, it should travel the rest of the way.
Morning. Were you here the whole time? Well, I'm worried. Thank you, This clock is broken. Yes, it's broken.
- with the hours and then the risk. - Is it that, or is it Adam? No, everything is fine with Adam. Adam is great. I trust Adam. I just, I just don't know if I'm ready. I can't stop thinking about this SD card.
- Is it that, or is it Adam? No, everything is fine with Adam. Adam is great. I trust Adam. I just, I just don't know if I'm ready. I can't stop thinking about this SD card. Why did it disappear when Markussen died?
FIONA: No. Excuse me. You cant just barge in on the tour without purchasing a ticket. You're giving us a tour for free. Free. Of course. The Code noir a decree that dictated the conditions of slavery, did not exist on these grounds.
What's that right there? Not much for subtlety. Jesus. Can you trace the source of the email? - Alec? - On it.
- No, you didn't. - You're right. I cheated, like you. You jumped to the other side. You put me on the other side. I had a deal that put your name right next to mine.
So if you agree on a wholesome variety show and all of a sudden it's filled with satire-- the most threatening humor there is-- you're worried about people hating what you're selling. Megan, let's talk about you and how you found this man. I could cast you, you know that. Yes, I'm sure he is a man who plays many roles. Luckily you don't have to worry about censorship with the show because it's so tame. Of course it's for daytime entertainment.
One proceeds on one's knees, and always gracefully. Be graceful at all times... Your Highness! Beautiful, is it not? Unroll it like this, and the story flows out in the pictures. Yeah!
Huh? What? If it is truly the fur of the fire-rat it will not burn, but merely glisten all the brighter. Of course! This robe is the genuine article! Placed in the fire, it will not burn.
Accidents happen, shattering our sense of control, if not our lives. It's no accident that Zach Hamilton is here. He's drawn to blood, like me. Did he kill Norma Rivera? After a week of vetting him, I haven't been able to find definitive proof. But I'm sure, if I keep following him, the truth will become clear.
Just let me do the talking. Heading in. - What's that? You jack that ring, too? - Yeah. Lyric was telling me about this blue ring her grandmother used to have. She would always try to steal it, but...
I don't know. I guess they all left. You still want the cherries jubilee? Light 'er up. Hey, if it isn't Jay Plunkett. It isn't.
Don't you know where you're from? You're Indian. A mix of slave and assassin! Hurting the Indians won't make you white! I saw the zone. Pedro's work is disgusting.
She's not a part of this, so just let her go. No, you will try and stop us. I-I can't let either of you go. You didn't know that that was a part of the plan, did you? Listen to me, Briggs, okay? That jawbone, it messes with your head, okay?
Not yet. We have to get the tape Harris made of Sanja. It's evidence Petrovic killed her. You said you didn't have it. I lied. He gave me a disc to take home and watch. Thought it would persuade me to tell my story.
This is the most exhaustive investigation in Swedish history and the only suspect... - Is Christer Pettersson. - Convicted and acquit within a year. 25 years ago. It's like Monty Python's parrot sketch. Eriksson suggests that the investigation is dead.
But then he kind of got fed up when it was so much about me and my career. And when push came to shove, he felt like he had to pull away for his own well-being. Oh, my God, we are Rihanna and Chris Brown! But I'm Chris Brown. Speaking of Chris Brown, I'm gonna start to batter. How's that stove?
And when push came to shove, he felt like he had to pull away for his own well-being. Oh, my God, we are Rihanna and Chris Brown! But I'm Chris Brown. Speaking of Chris Brown, I'm gonna start to batter. How's that stove? Warm, but it's really wobbly.
And I know how to get her to do that. So, uh... - You like pizza? - Yeah. L-let me guess. You're gonna tell me the best pizza's in New York and I gotta try it, right? Actually, it's in the Kingdom of Damarian on the north shore of the Dragon Fields of Zorn.
And instead, ask yourself the more important question. My cancer was a death sentence, remember? Yet, here I am. The Dragon. The liquid in the bottle, it worked. It cured me, August.
It's a good beginning to reaffirm the splendor of the world. We don't have a photo. I developed them and there's nothing there. It's all black. You fought for a machine that doesn't work. It's possible.
This morning I had a dream. Can I tell it to you? I see your eyes, in the distance, in the fog. I approach, and I see that you're a wolf. You scare me so much... that I can neither move nor flee. The wolf starts to circle around me. It smells me. It hesitates...
Now, at the hottest part of the day, the very worst time, her chicks are hatching. Just when they need her most, she's reaching the limit of her endurance. After 10 days of intensive fishing, the chicks' father comes back to take his turn at the nest. But will he be too late? He greets his young for the very first time. The coolness of the Benguela Current brought the penguins here but that very coolness is a great disadvantage, because it generates little rain.
Even so, it can only survive outside in the middle of the day for a matter of minutes. Now, the desert belongs to the sun alone. The sun has scorched life from the Sahara. And yet the vast desert it created is a source of life half a world away. The advancing Sahara vaporised the world's largest lake, leaving behind the silvery remains of countless microscopic algae. In winter, the wind carries away 700,000 tonnes of this mineral-rich dust every day.
And so did a lot of other people. Who the hell were these guys? All their signals were blocked by a very powerful electromagnetic field. I was hoping you could give us some guidance. He was a smartass kid. His armor was weird.
Hey, hey. Save the rest for divorce court. Mandy, get your ass down here. You show me where that computer is now. Let's go. Let's go!
Wasn't Audun Boysen a runner? Whether we throw the discus, run, do triple jump or are circus clowns, our strength is from the same place. But I'm glad you're paying attention. - Where's the letter? - I don't know where it is. - Isn't it in the box?
I will simply stand here. Perfectly invisible. And so I dedicate this show to my grandmother's memory. Now... please join me in honoring her with 60 seconds of absolute silence. Okay, Neruda, this play is extremely complicated. Let me guess.
No, sister, there's at most an hour. Have a seat. I'll tell you when it arrives. (Kurdish) What happened to your face? A dog attacked me. How did you get away?
Have a seat. I'll tell you when it arrives. (Kurdish) What happened to your face? A dog attacked me. How did you get away? I attacked back, it got scared and ran away.
All right. Hey. National Guard's en route. Meanwhile, the State Police are manning the roadblocks. Coast Guard is monitoring the waterways. We've got two choppers in the air, DC's sending more. Okay. So what about the Sheriff's residence?
You are right. Women get old faster than men. That's life. Come on. Let's not keep them waiting. I know what I'm saying. National service, it has become worthless.
We just have a few more questions for you about Angie Gower. Why you got a rental, Mike? Excuse me? Busted up your ride, racing around town like you got a Mad Tyte JDM? I have no idea what you just said. Where's your car?
- Telemachus! - Be quiet! Why is Clea in prison? You were raised far from reality. You trust anyone. You recognize this ring?
How much longer until Tung comes back? In seven days, Tung's spirit will come back. It may be the perfect time then. May be? What if it doesn't work? If it doesn't work, there's another way. What is it?
No, you need a fake life. Okay, there were always two things standing in our way: your uncontrollable side-- which is no longer a problem-- and Muirfield. You would just... leave everything? I found a town like the one yesterday. It's about two hours outside of Denver.
I'll keep that in mind. Is this the same... Yeah. Yeah, I guess it is. Your mom really does hate change. Oh, I visited our fort today.
Well, whatever their personal enmities may be, this is treason, is it not? And I command the one piece of evidence. May it benefit you. I'm sure it will. The Spear of Longinus? It has touched the very blood of your Christ.
And I command the one piece of evidence. May it benefit you. I'm sure it will. The Spear of Longinus? It has touched the very blood of your Christ. You know where it is?
May it benefit you. I'm sure it will. The Spear of Longinus? It has touched the very blood of your Christ. You know where it is? It sat deep beneath Jerusalem, buried, for centuries.
What do you want? A word or two with your new friend. I always knew there was someone behind Ingram. Like a black hole. Invisible, but powerful. So tell me, where did you move the machine?
I always knew there was someone behind Ingram. Like a black hole. Invisible, but powerful. So tell me, where did you move the machine? It moved itself. But who controls it?
That's what Decima's after. They wanted to kill Thornhill. He was buying up all the pay phones in Manhattan, but they stopped him. I don't know about you, but I don't want to see what happens when an evil multinational becomes omniscient. But why you would leave it so vulnerable? You made the machine to protect everybody.
- I'm not that picky. I like a lot of tea. - Well... - You're a little picky. Maybe I'm a little picky. Can people really change? Is our personality genetically pre-programmed?
Ease up! - What're you doing? ! - What're you doing? It's the military chip they put in her head, it makes her loco, you better watch that. Maybe you need to wake up, start thinking for yourself? This kind of tactic gets us nowhere.
- What you said... - Can we not? Why are you snapping at me all day? - I'm not snapping. - Yeah, you are. I'm sorry I asked the question.
Do jellyfish breathe? Er, no. But it's alive. Yes, but it doesn't breathe. Like a fish. A fish doesn't breathe? Like an oyster.
But it's alive. Yes, but it doesn't breathe. Like a fish. A fish doesn't breathe? Like an oyster. So, when it's washed up, it's dead? Yes.
You brought homework? Well, should I let you get back to it? Hell no. What's that? I have two of them, from a surgery I had to correct misshapen cartilage I was born with. I had a bar put in when I was 14.
Malibu beach house gets you laid every time. Not every time. Oh, my God, this house is amazing! Well, it's... Yeah. And look at that view.
These objects do not belong to us. They belong to all of us. You're insane. Friends don't call friends names. I know what the mirror does Jordyn. Look into it and gain your deepest desire.
It's not just revenge. Losing a member of your pack isn't like losing family. It's like you lose a limb. They wouldn't even let him see the body. Somebody called for a... I want his body.
-Is it understood? -Okay. Good. I am looking for the owner of a hubot. It is a 400 TwinX. A female.
You'd better hurry! (Or) I'm gonna eat your sandwich! Hey Mom, I know what I want for my... Where are you going? Where are we going? We're leaving. I packed your suitcase.
And you're the one who has to live with it when it's done. I done a lot of killing, both during and after the war. Mr. Durant and Senator Metcalf here, they'll call me a murderer as it suits them. But no matter what they call it, it won't bring back those men, or my family. Damn sure won't change who I am. You're refusing to sign the statement?
Kleinfelter doesn't have any priors. I just double-checked with VICAP. He was fingerprinted for his security clearance, but he doesn't have a DNA sample on file. So, in the messages that she passed on to that reporter, Vanessa Hiskie, did... she never referred to Kleinfelter by name? Excuse me. Did you find that book in this box? Yeah.
It was an armed raid. These things happen. Clearly I have been set up by someone. That's what you get when you ruffle feathers. Mrs Blunt said the library door was locked when she came back to the house. Well, obviously someone locked it when they left.
The crates. Crane, your gun! What are you doing? You dropped your gun. It was empty. You only fired one shot.
She said its eyes glowed yellow, its teeth were sharp like razors, and its breath was foul like something who had eaten the dead. And it could hear the cries of those in sorrow. So you believe. I believe El Cucuy wanders from place to place. And waits until it is called by voices of women who have suffered from evil. If enough voices cry out, they become one voice that cannot be ignored.
Righto, I'm sure you'll all be relieved to know that the mystery of the school break-in has finally been solved. Divinity of the Elements, I summon Thee. Earth, Water, Air, Fire, I invoke Thee. Must be an electrical fault. You saw it. - I don't know what you're talking about.
Ooh, Chicago! There is this pizza place called Gazzola's. It's fantastic.
And it's such a pretty thing He slips it on her finger And the choir begins to sing Does the spearmint lose its flavor On the bedpost overnight? If you pull it out like rubber
Hundreds, maybe. How many pods are there? No idea. It's a big ocean. How many mermaids could they summon in an emergency? You might be in some trouble, mate. That trident's mine.
Which I got for them for my research, for my grant. Which is important research, but at this point, it's research, Meredith. And what I'm talking about could save a life. I can't stop it in the middle. It will completely destroy the model. Just because I printed a fork does not mean my research is a joke.
Well, we got it. Now let's destroy it. How rare to stare into the face of Death. Something I never intend to do again. There's a junkyard in Tarrytown with an industrial car compactor. I've seen it turn an SUV into an ice cube.
With all due respect, if the intel were worth having, then I would have it. There's a price on your head. There's a running price on my head, Agent Ressler. Anslo Garrick? Listen to me. If this intel was disseminated, it was done so directly to you.
I would count on something hellish. The curse was built to be unstoppable. There's nothing that can be done. Well, it is possible to stop it. - What? - By using the scroll itself.
what are you doing here, you nimrod? uh, there was a fire. big question is, what are you doing here? what, did somebody call in a missing doughnut? uh, actually someone reported they couldn't find your head. but we found it.
You shed hair. You shed bras. That is untrue and unkind. You stay over my place for the weekend, And there's hair all over every pillow, and a bra on every door knob. You got a bra in my silverware drawer. - Oh, which one?
I promise. Camille, what are we doing? - Come to see my bear. - Why? Last week, there was a young boy here with a crust of bread he'd spread with honey. He threw it, but his aim was bad.
The prophecy is made-up but it's also true. It's about all of us. Right now, it's about you. And you still can change everything. Oh, we got a hugger. Be careful.
The ambush waiting for us. They kill us before we find a working car. Okay. So, what' the current plan? Two cars we haven't tried yet. - The minivan and the green SUV. - Yeah. Okay. I'll head for the SUV, draw the mimics to me. You go for the minivan.
6 minutes left until detonation. We need to get on deck. The time is almost up. And the engine? Where is the engine? - It got wedged in.
Really? That's funny. Because we're having a little bit of a situation here! The phones are going crazy. What happened at that reading? Well, it was a really good crowd.
- Chris. - No. I can't do it. I can't do this, I'm so sorry. Ben's been through all this before. His grief isn't new.
- No. I can't do it. I can't do this, I'm so sorry. Ben's been through all this before. His grief isn't new. But it's new for me.
I can't do it. I can't do this, I'm so sorry. Ben's been through all this before. His grief isn't new. But it's new for me. And it'll be new tomorrow.
We grow our own food. We build our own shelter. Whatever we need, the Box provides. The rest is up to us. The Box? Yeah.
We'll be okay, Joshy. Don't you fret. Hey, well, maybe take a day or two, make sure you like it. Or I can take 10 years. I'm fucking with you, Joshy. Your thing is gonna be totally brilliant. I remember when this song was just considered bad.
- It won't take it. - You're just a little rusty. You don't understand. It's not a question of being rusty. I can flip the switches. I can turn the knobs. But my power comes from here. It comes from...
The wicked from the innocent. And that which sinks from that which rises. He destroys all, but only to start again. You sure? Yes. The storm cannot be stopped.
- Jake, you getting this? - Oh, yeah. MAN: There it is. This tornado just touched down. We can see it from here.
-I can't turn my mind off. - Guys. Guys. Guys. -Will you stop it? Come on. Let's not argue, okay? We came up with an awesome plan. It is smart.
Ha, no! 25 at most. Seriously, it's not a joke? You're really keeping this? Er, yeah. Sure?
Detached it where? You said there was nothing between those stations. Not on the maps, but once you eliminate the other factors, the remaining thing must be the truth. That carriage vanished, so it must be somewhere. But why, though? Why detach it in the first place?
They're building something big out there. What's it doing out there? This thing is like any intelligence. It needs to grow. To advance. Right now, it's settling somewhere it thinks it's safe from outside threats. Somewhere its massive appetite for power can be met.
This thing is like any intelligence. It needs to grow. To advance. Right now, it's settling somewhere it thinks it's safe from outside threats. Somewhere its massive appetite for power can be met. But it will want more than that. After a while survival won't be enough.
That was the last time I saw my father. It turns out Beth, Mickey and Theo were right. A few weeks after I left, my dad got shitfaced drunk in a bar, and confessed to killing my mother. He hung himself in his jail cell with a sheet. Before he died, he revealed that my mother's body was in the freezer, and that he'd taken it out during the night while I was sleeping. He buried her up in the mountains.
What? And maybe the end of us. Great news, Muppets. We're sold out. Fine. I mean, great, great. Well done, Dominic. Hey, I have an amazing idea for an act.
The terrible need. It is a fierce and jealous love, Bilbo. It sent his grandfather mad. Balin, if Thorin... had the Arkenstone... or if... it was found... would it help? That stone crowns all. It is the summit of this great wealth... bestowing power... upon he who bears it.
Balin, if Thorin... had the Arkenstone... or if... it was found... would it help? That stone crowns all. It is the summit of this great wealth... bestowing power... upon he who bears it. Would it stay his madness? No, laddie. I fear it would make him worse.
No! What have I done? If I cannot liveth with thee... then I shall not liveth at all. That frog is not poisonous. What? We're not dead?
Look at that! That's good. You're amazing. - What are you doing? This plant needs to be pruned... in order to grow right. So, I was...
He wouldn't have imagined any of this if you hadn't told him those goddamn stories. Don't blame me! What he's saying is different from the stories. What do you mean? The Death Wolf isn't a demon. It's meant to go after wicked folk.
- No. They left. They spent about 40 years in the desert trying to escape. Yeah. We have dinner once a year and talk about it. It's a big deal for us. Listen, could you take a look at that tablet? There's something wrong with it.
Shut up! Shut up in your face! Shut up right now! Do you want to be smashed? Yeah, you can run, but if you leave those gates... I swear to you, your hideous doppelganger... who looks a lot like the lead singer of the Counting Crows... will get it! Dada. That's right.
Told her I'd spend the night again. Ah, her sweet boy. How'd you get the simulit back? You know, our machine. The Shadow. When you sold it to Robbie, how'd you get it back? I didn't.
Forgive me, but wouldn't it be better if the club could be kept out of it? - I don't see how it could... - Oh, with the right lawyer, certainly. I know a man, ex-member himself, very useful at sorting out our scrapes over the years. I don't give a shit about the club. Smash it.
Isaac... Whitney? OK, you asked for it. Ohh! Right. Are you concentrating yet? You broke my arm! No, I sprained it.
If you press a keycard against your mobile phone for long enough, it corrupts the magnetic strip. The card stops working. It's a common problem. Never put your keycard with your phone. What happens if I use the card now? It still doesn't work. But it doesn't read as the wrong card now.
Look, it's really dark out there. He probably doesn't see you. - Oh, it fucking sees me. - It ha... it has night vision. - They have night vision? That tiger has night vision goggles?
He probably doesn't see you. - Oh, it fucking sees me. - It ha... it has night vision. - They have night vision? That tiger has night vision goggles? It doesn't have night vision goggles.
- Excellent. Should I put it down here? - What do you take out first? - This. Yes, exactly. So, the needle, you have to secure it. Good.
Stu has E*D too? No, not at all. He used to take them for fun. We used to fuck for hours. His cock was like a battering ram. It was like it was made of liquid metal.
It's Johnny Worricker. Nice. A warm welcome to this beautiful island. As we all know, this could hardly be a more threatening moment. We meet at a dangerous time when a setback in the financial markets has been misrepresented as a crisis in the engine room of capitalism itself. We all remember how quickly the Berlin Wall came down.
You really think I'm a murderer? I know four people are dead. Where's my flight key? MPs took it. Check the data on it. It'll have all my keystrokes logged, back up what I'm saying.
I'm fine. June, I have a... Hello? Are you there? Yeah. I have a bad connection. I'm listening. I have a... I have a message for you.
-Yeah, let's do it. Ladies and gentlemen, this will be Charles' and Tom's first. I am so happy that you have this to share together. Oh, and one last reminder. The weapons' rack is stocked with the latest and the greatest. And my personal favorite is the Mauser Elite SSX Double Barrel. It has a delicate trigger, and smoothest discharge.
No, thanks. Excuse! I'm sorry. Bye. The Burguesinha is well loose. More Than in Cheers.
- Yes. We were careful not to wake you. You should let me know if you're not coming home. I told you. You told me a lot yesterday. I like Marie-Colette's magazine.
Sit down. No one will hurt you. You just have us all tell me what you know. Are we clear? The exchange is tomorrow held in Luxembourg. I do not know where I should at Jacob Sturm wait with the expert.
How much fun he had painting the toy soldiers with you. This was given to me by the Director of the Smithsonian. It's the first Medal of Honor awarded to a Hispanic-American, Corporal Joseph De Castro. He fought for the Union. Linda, I don't know what to say. It's clear the President sees you as a friend. I've never been that to him. But his job is bigger than friendship.
Not even by me. You find a place to live yet? Turn to your left. We call this "proximity overlook." Yeah, well, the rest of the world calls it stalking. What you're seeing here is aerial surveillance footage of the Bawri Tana marine combat outpost -- or what's left of it.
Beijing, China Over in Asia, professional gamers are treated like rock stars. It's a viable career opportunity. They actually live in gamer houses. So it's set up to be a thing all year long. I think their approach to practice is that it's like a day job. The fan base is immense.
I just need to put a bunch of stuff on memo... Everything Moroccan that you have. These linens, I will purchase, obviously. Carved-wood stools... Anything, mosaic works, as well. This lamp is perfect! But that's not for sale.
The French word for "fox." And this. Important men get their pictures taken. His name really was Hank. Well, Henry. Henry Renard, the only son of Harrison Renard. So, tell me about this company, Delphi.
If you're angry, you're optimistic you can stop this from happening again. I know how to stop it. If you really want to kill your brother, Margot, wait until you can get away with it. Or find someone to do it for you. You said you were worried about the bird. Thought you might like to see it.
Now is not a good time. He's doing a healing. This shouldn't take too long. This way. My boy's wound won't heal. It never heals.
Adoption, surrogacy... those are all viable options... Thank you. But not everyone is a viable candidate. There will always be people with a need for companionship and... and connection. If your board had let me finish, I would have told them that filling that void is way more important than building a more empathetic service bar. I'm sure you understand that the future you're proposing raises great moral questions.
Let's leave the bad sexual puns to me. So, what happened with Myles? He went home with some guy last night. That's great. Your plan worked. Yeah.
We got out together. I was with her for a while. Is she dead? She's just gone. After that, that's when they found me. I mean, I knew they were bad, but they had a code.
- I'm her brother. - My brother Caleb was here. - What? She's lying! Can't you see that? Norman, stop it! He can't help it!
Hey, you can't just say he's gone. You owe us an ending. I owe you nothing. I am a dungeon master. I create a boundless world, and I bind it by rules. Too heavy for a bridge?
It's here, it's here! I think you're going to love it. I spent so many hours playing with this when I was your age. Yeah, me too. Hey, quick, turn off your car. Why?
I believe you have a link to the machine, anthropomorphic delusions aside. You say you're an interface? Your eyes and your ears are your ports, input and output? We can put a stop to that. There is a bone in the back of your ear. It's the stapes... or stirrup.
It is a real scam. plastic chairs, gadgets to tighten. Shit. Unfortunately we can not help it, Lunde. People want this. We have to...? That chair in front of you, we are very proud.
I'd rather forget it too. I didn't ask you to favour me. - Done this before? - No. Put this on and remove your chain. - It's a lucky charm. - Put it on later. I can't take it off.
The water's not deep enough. It's not possible. Exactly why the Russians won't expect it. At high tide, we'll have two, three feet clearance. That canal is so narrow, we won't have any margin for error. And then there's the coral growth.
It's a narrow side street, several subway stops in the vicinity. It sounds to me like a good choke point with multiple escape routes. I think we found the location of Kelly's next job. That's not all we found. I've got research here, something about a Bible-- the Gutenberg Bible? The Gutenberg Bible?
It sounds to me like a good choke point with multiple escape routes. I think we found the location of Kelly's next job. That's not all we found. I've got research here, something about a Bible-- the Gutenberg Bible? The Gutenberg Bible? It's on a world tour.
I think we found the location of Kelly's next job. That's not all we found. I've got research here, something about a Bible-- the Gutenberg Bible? The Gutenberg Bible? It's on a world tour. It's leaving New York tomorrow for Venice, Italy.
Why don't you make me? What's wrong with curing malaria? Or don't you want to make the world a better place? Let me explain something to you. The sun throws a certain amount of energy onto this planet. We turn it into food, clothing, shelter, et cetera.
It's a rabbit. See? Do you like the rabbit? Do you? You see? Do you like the rabbit? You like it?
- and you are a burn victim. - I don't get it. Wasn't the whole point of a fireman costume to justify the fire extinguishers? You know, the ones we'll need in order to put out any fires at the parade? The plan is constantly evolving, Sue. It's alive.
You should try eating less. And what is it you want here warrior? Who are you? Tell me. Tell me who it is I'm touching. So much pain this body has seen.
No, that would be lame. I don't live in a building. I live here. - Where? All I see is a dumpster. - Yeah, it's my apartment. I converted it, and I live inside.
What happened between you and Deke? Why did you even come home tonight? Was the sex bad? Did you hit him? No, the sex was fine. Actually, it was better than fine.
You and I could do a lot of special things together and have a shitload of fun doing it. I'll think about it. You think about it, then you give me a call when you realize that you really can have it all. I found your Mustang. Looks like it's been abandoned. I'm going to check it out.
At best, it would result in the death of the one man who knew his origins. The only way Da Silva sails off into retirement is if the boss dies. That file is unusable as a nuclear arsenal. He kept it solely to remind Pardillo of their mutually-assured destruction. Well, it won't be much use to a DA, either. I stole it from his office.
My prayers go with you." "Your friend, Ambrose." Whoever broke into Ambrose's house was looking for this. This rosary he mentions. Valuable, is it? It's reputed to have healing powers. You don't say?
I mean, I told Vicky they have got to trim those branches. How are you supposed to see cross traffic when the sidewalk's a damn jungle? You're fired. What? You're fired. The address calculation code. It's too long.
This my dear viewers, is maybe a once in a lifetime opportunity for a few minutes uncensored material to see, I have something important to say, I had to kill and will even dying to be on TV, I call you the facts, The U,S, government is funded by the rich, It keeps the people on the intellectual level of children,
Before I tell you what you should do, I give you the facts, And I'm talking about facts, The NSA stores all calls, E-mails and SMS, People like Snowden or Assange, which provide valuable information, be prosecuted by the U,S, government, It is funded by the rich, She wants the people ignorant and hold the intellectual level of children,
Almost as much as they look up to Clarke. Yeah, but we know the truth, don't we? You're a coward. I learned that the day you kicked out the crate from beneath me. I think I found it. Get outside.
It would be bright green, almost neon. It's called lichen and it's highly toxic. I need to know if Yuki has consumed any. If he has the poison, just treat him. I'm sorry, but not without knowing the species. I need a sample.
- Did you have any trouble with Ikeda? - Only minor. The white wolf was exactly where you said it would be. But we have two problems now. First, the lichen is not a cure. It'll wear off in a matter of days.
I think your opinion might be slightly biased, Sheriff. Hear me out. What we're dealing with here is basically someone who lacks motive. No rhyme, no reason, right? Meaning what? Our enemy is not a killer.
I had a Greyhound and Knutson had-- what was it with the cherry? A Rob Roy. Rob Roy. Yeah. You had a few of them, if I'm not mistaken. What about the Hess case? What about it?
I screwed up. Hey! I heard gunshots. What's going on up there? Then the Aswang would flick its long black tongue and eat the baby. No... uh, actually, no, not at first.
Time to put my newfound knowledge to the test. So, sir, popcorn setting, always too short, am I right? I'm sorry? On our microwave. We have the same microwave. Oh, I didn't buy it.
This way. Okay. So there's a fully-stocked fridge with snacks. Sling is over there, nipple clamps on the bedside table with some erotic oils and handcuffs. Dildos and toys are on the wall. Oh, I got that strap-on in Zanzibar in the 19th century.
Mr. Roscoe Pelfrey? Yes, my name's Gareth Lestrade. I'm a... I'm a detective. I wondered if I might ask you a few questions about the man that mugged you. Did you get it? Did the file open up all right?
Did you get hurt? I-I need to know what happened. Finch, I've got eyes on a sniper. And I might have a lead on who's doing the shooting. The solicitation Ms. Groves gave me is visually identical to an image commonly sent out as spam. But digitally someone has hidden a message inside the image.
Phone has no cell history. I can't ping a tower, nothing. There's no way to access her phone log. I got it. I broke the encryption. All right. Look up her internet searches.
What? Something terrible happened. A... A submarine... Just say it. A submarine went down... the Belomorsk. We lost 160 men... a... a catastrophic propeller malfunction of some kind.
Radiology. Hey, Rory. How you doing? Besides the fact that I have bone cancer, I'm great. Seriously. Look at this polish.
Hello. My name is Niles Pottinger. And welcome to the Badlands. We are currently transporting the latest, most advanced mineral extraction equipment from Cedars to the boom-town of Defiance. It's a small town, big of heart. Let's swap sides. My right side is...
Lily ends up with the gun, shoots that person, and he or she runs away. Those are the facts as we currently know them. Just because Lily didn't shoot Toby doesn't mean she wasn't involved in whatever got him shot. - Is that your gut? No, my gut says that whoever ran away is our killer and that Lily Greene is a completely innocent schoolteacher who just had the worst night of her life. Would you like a cup of coffee?
I am happy about the win. But I got a call from the editor of New York Lawyer, and they want to interview the man responsible for making that happen. And you want to give Harvey the credit. I want you to take your name off. I already did. This case was never for me.
It's so comforting when she says, "this is super awkward." And you know, sometimes she arches her back when she says it, like this. "This is super awkward." This is super awkward. You know, I bet you if I stayed in Poland, my sisters and I would have had our own show.
Um, and by the time I was getting up, he was already coming through the door. Where'd you get the machete? It was on the chair. He was coming after me, so I just... I shoved him into the hallway and... and closed my eyes, and I swung as hard as I could. You always keep a machete in your room? It's not mine.
But you better turn that gun on yourself next, Mr. Collier, because you have broken just as many laws, and the only difference is, I didn't wrap myself up in the American flag and try to convince people that I was a hero. I believe you love your country. I believe that when you started, people thought what you were doing made a lot of sense. But it's gone too far, and it has to stop. Please, who built the machine? How does it work?
Been there. Anger Management 2x53 - Charlie and His Probation Officer's Daughter - Original air date March 20, 2014 Did you find the mouse yet? No, I just finished setting the traps. Don't worry.
And did your heart die with him? For the past ten years, you have lived here, in the safety of France, and I've seen too much suffering at home. And you would ask of my heart? Ask me that question when you have earned the right. The day of my marriage, a secret contract was slipped in amongst the others. The French arranged it with my mother.
Max, you think you're not smart, but you are. You just need to come up with little tricks to help jog your memory. My memory doesn't jog. I've smoked so much pot, it's in one of those hospitals learning to walk again. What was the Great Compromise? You mean besides you moving in with me?
It's merciful. In seven days, we run out of food. In 14, people will be starving. In 21, we'll turn on each other. The time to act is now. How'd this virus get inside the dome?
- She said it'd be just the one pig, but she was wrong. There are more. Just since this morning. A dozen of them. Quarantine the healthy animals. This is what Rebecca was messing around with in her kitchen. That pig virus is their extermination plan.
We'll get it for you. You keep looking at that plant. It's a Ficus benjamina. Popular choice in decorative office greenery. Thrives even when neglected. The Ficus is an aggressive grower;
You gotta hold your side a little lower. I'm on the heavy side of the seesaw right now. A little to your right. My right. Damn it, Ginsberg. Put it back.
I'm never half-cocked. Holy shit. See? See? You forgot about Andy already. Why, you're... You're a freak.
Dude, say yes! I got to be honest. That was the best spaghetti I've ever had. You know what the trick is? You throw a noodle up on the ceiling. If it sticks, you know it's perfect.
I got to be honest. That was the best spaghetti I've ever had. You know what the trick is? You throw a noodle up on the ceiling. If it sticks, you know it's perfect. It's still on my ceiling, isn't it?
How's it going? Did you park your white horse outside? Spare me the suspense and tell me what your "save the day" plan is. I don't have anything yet. The idea I had wasn't great. It wasn't great.
You don't know me. You don't know where I'm from. You ever talk to my wife again, I will kill you. So classical four-dimensional general relativity combined with the nuclear forces can explain the relative abundances of all known elements in the universe. You finally looked at my paper, congratulations. I looked at it when I rejected it from the Physics Review a year ago. But that line wasn't a line from your paper.
You need to tell people what happened to you. You tell them. It will mean more coming from you, neena. You're never going back in there. You should not make promises you cannot keep. My freedom is temporary.
- Both of you, settle down. - She's the one... - She's accusing me of losing a kidney... - I said settle down! Oh, I found it! They dumped it in the basin.
- That is the dumbest thing - I'm not letting a freaking coin - you've ever said. - decide whether or not I go to jail tonight! We don't have time to fight! We need to make a decision and commit to it. So if someone has a better idea, say it now! Heads, we get the body.
The Aristotle wasn't always hidden. The Daleks got here before us. You don't like soldiers much, do you? You don't need to be liked. You've got all the guns. A moleculon nanoscaler! You know what it does, then?
And when a DOT and a DOS love each other very much... Oh, I miss that sound. That's it. It has to be. I'm gonna call Neal. Hey, we opened the file.
But he is innocent. It matters to me. Mary, listen to me. To free him would reveal what you are to him. You think he could love you then? Do not lose his love.
You'll be on blood thinners for a while, and you'll follow up with a cardiologist, but you should be fine. And all those flu-like symptoms? Were plaque filling the vessels of your heart. And now my heart is filled with a different pain. Before I forget, um, in my bag, there is a file I meant to give you earlier. There it is, in my purse.
I got out because Re-Kon was high and I didn't like the way he was driving. Can I go now? Look, I know your father's looking out for you. But who's looking out for Marvin? Claudette. How was your drive?
I've got an idea and I've told Mrs Hughes but I want you to know it. I could swear the train ticket hadn't been used. I would swear it. What? I saw the ticket in Mrs Hughes's hand when she found it in the coat. It hadn't been torn in half.
Look, that's why we're following you! Everyone has family they're trying to find. I'm just trying to keep from losing anyone else along the way. How long does she expect to keep going if she keeps giving her rations away? The rest of us are dehydrated, aslee-- It came through the brush.
The spikes are starting to understand that they're part of you. Wait. You make it seem like they've got a mind of their own. They do. This isn't just physical strength. There's an alien life-form fusing with your human DNA. It -- it wants to control all of you.
For God's sake, we're having a wedding here! You may resume your ritual after I speak to Tom Mason about the Beamer. The Beamer is important. So, why the hell did you interrupt? ! I have been deconstructing the Espheni whistle you brought back. You are correct.
Just do it! Bull's-eye, Matt. Bull's-eye. Before his untimely death, my brother implemented a safeguard. That triskelion she wears -- it doesn't mean "peace." It never did.
You were lucky to have that transgender person to help. Thanks for what you did. Bates's gear is not all it's cracked up to be. There is a bad stash of gear coming into the prison.
It drove my parents crazy, but... Grandma thought it was adorable. You okay? Last night my printer went off by itself. I couldn't turn it off. I hit the cancel button.
There's something I have to do, something I have to stop. I have to take you back to Eichen, Lorraine. No. No. I don't think you're gonna be taking me anywhere. I can hear the recorder in your pocket.
It's more dangerous than this job. Those women, they rush the stage like these are the last men on the planet. I have bruises that I can't explain. Ladies be crazy, Javi. The card's rfid architecture is like nothing I've ever seen. Yeah, but there's got to be something else that you can tell us about it.
- Is that possible? - It's like the Munroe effect. A Navy man at the turn of the century invented incendiary warheads. Bazooka rockets. He called them shaped charges. But a nuclear core is no rocket.
But... I'm glad you're here. You're welcome. You could've left him in the building, you know. I'd be tempted. Can you get anything from your computer?
I need to take this call from a tenant. Hello. This is the manager. Hello? Turn the noise down! Turn it the fuck down, you motherfuckers! There are other people in the fucking world!
Made of copper. More than effective against your mail-order magic. My men are unburdening Ian Fell of his problem as we speak. Thanks to you, Constantine. What do you want with the acetate, Midnite? There's no money it in.
Dómini nóstri - Jésu. - What's happening? There's only one true way to deal with our recording. I drew on the disc's own dark magic to send it back to hell where it belongs. It belongs to me. It's mine!
Damon and I spent the entire summer looking for Stefan, and I was trying to put on a good face because Caroline was throwing this party for me, but I was so sad. I was two seconds from deciding that I wasn't gonna go. I wasn't gonna leave the room until Damon walked in to give me my birthday gift. It was a necklace that Stefan had given me. I'd lost it, and Damon knew what the necklace meant to me. My necklace.
Where bad behavior was corrected. I'm sorry we couldn't save Anthony. Anthony died protecting me. It's up to me now to make sure his sacrifice wasn't in vain. What will you do? You told me you wouldn't help me fight a war, John. Well, sometimes a war comes to you.
What? Benoît living here with you, finding a job at the same hospital where you work. - Are you two together again? - Honestly... This is the last time I give you a plant. - Why? Look at it.
Oh, my God. Okay. Okay. You're having an emotional reaction to your surroundings. Tell me what you're feeling. This couch is terrible. It doesn't match anything.
- I didn't write the letter. - Wasn't me. Then where'd it come from? Ho, ho, ho! Well, that sucked. So the letter was actually from her parents?
Yes. Uh, yeah. It's good to meet you, Nathan. It's good to meet you, too, Caleb. I guess the first thing I should do is explain your pass. Now, it's simple enough.
You're feeling guilty, but I'm not a taxi. Her parents wouldn't have come. Come on. Off we go. I'm seeing stars, my foot hurts so much. It could be broken.
Cooper, what can I do? Let me go home. MAN: You're absolutely positive? His solution was correct. He'd had it for years.
Sarah, he's lying. Hey. He's the machine. I'm Reese. It's me, Sarah. All right, listen, the terminator's not dead.
The devil loves unspoken secrets. Especially those that fester in a man's soul. What's yours? I am not a great writer. I am not Hawthorne. But from my first hearing of it, this tale has haunted me.
Anybody caught a Monarch yet? ...I've always wanted to be a dad. Let me tell you, I love it! Yeah! And I love my Ford Flex. It treats me to a smooth ride, and you know what?
Who bets against housing? - What's the ABX at? - What's ABX? It tracks subprime mortgage bond value. Go back to sleep. The ABX is at...
Yeah, or other people. - That sounds nice. I would like that. - Yeah. Finally. Mark, hey. It's a bloodbath up here. Morgan stock has lost half its value. It's down to 23. 10.
It worked! It worked! Could you see me down at the gas pumps? I was jumping all over the place. I was so excited. Felt weird pointing a rifle at you even if it weren't loaded. Oh, I always keep it loaded.
You didn't let him go? Not to the Snake! It wasn't my choice. It was time for goodbye. You understand that it is too far? I cannot carry this body with me.
I set the alarm at your condo, and I gave my keys to your pet-sitter, like you told me. And I sent you a picture of me and Polenta. She misses you. Oh, hell no. Where is my purse? Have you seen it anywhere?
But I realize now that keeping something to myself is... Selfish. Especially when that something is the Krabby Patty. Okay, everybody, let's get back to Bikini Bottom and... Oh, no! I don't have the page! Oh, no!
Rocky's going to love this place. ♪ You know ♪ I finally got out of that place ♪ ♪ It's true ♪ Old friends are just such a waste ♪ The coach was heading to London.
Just put it in your window. Let your customers decide. My family's been going to you my whole life. Look, the big companies, they pay me for my shelf space. Maybe you can sell one of your mops to those big companies. And maybe they'll put it on my shelf.
The burro don't want to vámonos. Well, I don't really care what the burro wants. Get out of my bank, you beast! I know what you're thinking, but not yet. Hold it. How is this jackass stuck?
Quick! Whoa, what's going on? Sir... we were unable to acquire the droid on Jakku. It escaped capture... aboard a stolen Corellian YT model freighter. The droid... stole a freighter? Not exactly, sir.
Do you mean the murderers... traitors, and thieves you call friends? You'll be relieved to hear I have no idea. You still want to kill me. That happens when you're being hunted... by a creature in a mask. Tell me about the droid. He's a BB unit with a selenium drive... and a thermal hyperscan vindicator.
Then, should you still feel you need them, I'll have copies made. Come on, Edith, come with me. Let's take you upstairs. I thought you said the dog was dead. I left it out there on its own. Thought it would perish in the cold.
Hi. I'm Don Champagne. Why don't you shake the hand that's gonna shock the world. What happened to your hand? I actually... I dropped a couch on it. Was it heavy?
Jeanine murdered an entire faction, Caleb. That faction could no longer be trusted. She killed our parents. Our parents brought that on themselves. What are you talking about? The box?
Not now, Aldo. Go, Susan! That was not part of my plan. Just like a woman to wear jewelry into battle. Although, this is the ugliest fucking necklace I've ever seen! Yes, it is.
Now prove yourself smart and tell me where it is. Please, I beg you. Don't kill me. I'm not gonna kill you. I have a job for you. And a gold coin if you get it done.
Well, do I sign out. So, we'll see you tomorrow morning. Good night, ladies. Good night. - What about your jacket? Keep them.
which will sooner or later make them reimpose, there or elsewhere, the very conditions you're fighting against. So, stop this stuff about improving their conditions, deal with the system, or else you're not serious. [Kasser] Our economic system is one of consumer capitalism, and that's why the government needs to have consumption at very high levels, um, and why, of course, the corporations do, and why at some level most people then buy into it. I can't tell you the number of people I talked to who say, "Well, but if we became less materialistic our economy would tank." Well, they're right in some level, because our economy is based on materialism, it's based on these kinds of values. That's what it needs in order to survive.
It is the military. That's why they tell you to strip. - It's a theater here! - You gotta show them your panties. And you idiots! Tell her to shake it.
What if I was? Come on, Kate! Of course you are. Look, Harold was an accountant. If there's anybody leading a resistance in this town, it's not Harold, so who else is involved in this group? This group is the only thing that's kept me sane here. How long have you been active?
- Yes. Shes been here a year now. - She came here for her sorfs sake. - Is he sick? It's strange, it comes and goes. But he's doing well now, the fresh air will do him good.
Shes been here a year now. - She came here for her sorfs sake. - Is he sick? It's strange, it comes and goes. But he's doing well now, the fresh air will do him good. It does everyone good.
Hey! You bastards. What, you couldn't have done better, Torstein! I don't care about that game. I want you to cut off my arm. - Why not keep it?
Zach, Zach! The Mosasaurus! Oh, my God! That was awesome! Hold on tight. We're gonna give you an even closer look at our Mosasaurus.
He is drowning us. Where do they go? Megan? We have no time. There's a western tunnel. It leads to an elevator. I know the code.
God made our land so beautiful... it was unfair to the rest of the world. So to even the score... God populated the land... with a race of evil men. The primary impediment to a free and uninhibited future is the violence and terror that currently grips our beloved country. A violence initiated by these evil men... will be brought to justice... in the name of decency... and in the memory of Luis Carlos Galán. We will extradite. This decision... will not come from fear.
I'll need an egg. The shroud was right here. Essentia crescat. One skin cell, one strand of hair, that's all I need to grow a piece of Aleister. There is no getting used to this. What will this spell accomplish?
- A so-so harvest. - With all these? When Grandma was alive, there were a lot more. There were so many, we gave them to all the neighbours. This plum tree's getting old. I think Grandpa planted it the year mum was born.
Oh yeah. Eddie, my boy, you know that I love you. And why not? You're a genius, you shit gold, and Oscars are made of gold. But this film is different. It's humane, you know?
Charmed. So you're the chappie who's going to translate the mythical language? Not so mythical as you think, young man. The Verbis Diablo, the Devil's Tongue, has roots as old as Aramaic and likely much older. It was an oral tradition for the most part like most now dead languages. We haven't entirely lost it, we've just forgotten it.
- That I do not. - So this is where you live? - Is it? Disguise it as you might try, Sir Malcolm recognised your picture. Perhaps he's just a fan from my theatrical days. Do you know of the medical neurosis called the phantom limb?
No. You're never supposed to start an improv with a transaction. But whatever. All right, try to keep it up for three minutes. Begin. This fruit is defective. How so?
But whatever. All right, try to keep it up for three minutes. Begin. This fruit is defective. How so? It's all nasty and bruised up.
I'm gonna cast the other parts. Of course, I play Edwina. I know she has freckles and a more ample bosom than I, but I think we can use our imaginations. How do I put this constructively? This piece of writing is".obscene. It's pornographic.
He's reached an age where he understands more of it. Or... I don't know. He expresses it more or something. There now... Did you hear that my boys paid the locals a visit? They bought a goat and are calling it Preben.
That s impossible. You seem very nervous these days. Hummm... So relax. It isn t complicated. The truth has no need for ploys.
You seem very nervous these days. Hummm... So relax. It isn t complicated. The truth has no need for ploys. It s naked, it doesn t say anything, it s obvious.
Chuck, did you...? Chuck, did you read this? Read what? This bill, did you read it? Emergency room bill. I may have glanced at it.
Hey, Kevin! It's really exciting to talk to you. It really is. Oh, you guys are very sweet. So, Penny, listen, I saw your movie. Oh, wow.
Still better than Hans Peter, right'? HP. Much better! Hans Peter? My husband? The Camino robs you of all of your strength... and gives you three times as much back. And to all those who cannot walk the Camino, rest assured, this Way is only one of an endless number of possibilities.
We're working on an exit strategy. How about this guy? He's on vacation. In the meantime, I think we found a way inside. We've been combing through the employee records, looking for a shell. - I'm cooking the ID now.
Lydia's not gonna have a problem getting into Stanford. Kira's thinking USF. Malia's, uh, gonna, you know, she'll figure something out, okay. The plan's perfect. Or we could also wait until we actually get into college and then figure out where to live. I have a vision, dude.
It's a relief. It'll help a lot. Of course, it's only a drop in the bucket. I swear, everyone I know has had problems with them. I had one. The computer in the engine, it locked in the middle of the Rockies.
So, you two have stayed in touch? - Yeah. - We've been pen pals. What have you been doing with yourself? You look so different. You look exactly the same. Good, you found my backpack.
Everything is gonna be great. Hi. Hey, sweetie, how's it going? It's going great. I can't hear you. Where are you? I'm at the library. Nice.
There's no opinions to be had. His writing is gorgeous. Well, in my opinion, it isn't. Said the guy who can't write a grocery list. - Shh, shh... - Ready whenever you are, sir. Today marks the 80th Anniversary of the Social Security Act.
I find that news surprising and unlikely. French lives have been lost, Perales. Enough is enough. Then I accept. Your Majesty has shown great wisdom and discretion. Do this, and you will never lay your hands on the cipher.
I was just afraid you weren't up to it physically. I may be up to more than you realize. Everett... I think it's time for us to rebuild our family. Leave the light on. Note the effect on the pupils of a few drops of adrenaline chloride.
Sorry, I have no recollection of this whatsoever. At Cromartie. I paid you in heroin. Excuse me. Everyone knew you were the famous Dr. Thackery. You say I fixed it with a gold earring?
You can't make me do this. I emancipated myself from you. I have nothing to do with you! Nothing to do with me? Our connection runs much deeper than a hand print. Deeper than hell shoes.
Wait. There's one missing... Hi Dagny. God you're beautiful. Famous words to a succubus. The last thing your mother said to me was your name.
When they get it open, all hell will break loose. That is the signal for my friends to come here, and... [P.A. feeds back] Cage: My fellow citizens, this is your president speaking. I have news to share with you that will change all of our lives forever. For 97 years, Mount Weather has been our home.
- What? How do you know Tom's killer had a blue jacket? From you! You asked Dave if I had a blue ja... I saw a blue jacket in the woods with a bloodstain on it. I thought you'd want to know!
Every month or so. Why? Well, I guess this really isn't the kind of place where you get to know your neighbors. You're talking about 1017, aren't you? That smell, am I right? Smell? Oh, yeah, there's some sort of an odor.
It won't be easy. Do I keep you for what's easy? Do you think I've promoted you for the charm of your presence? I keep you because you're a serpent. Do not be a viper in my bosom. You know my decision.
Do we talk about teacups and time and the rules of disorder? The teacup's broken. It's never going to gather itself back together again. Not even in your mind? Your memory palace is building. It's... full of new things.
I'd like a reason to stay. I've done things that I'm not proud of, Vanessa. I've hurt people... and I'm going to hurt more. It's impossible to avoid for what I'm trying to do. But I take no pleasure in it... in cruelty. But this city isn't a caterpillar.
ANTI-PULLY WEEK Anti-pully week? You misspelled it. Do you know the story of the bumblebee? The bumblebee is too heavy to fly. It has a very dense body and tiny wings.
What's left without singing or dancing? You could tell stories about yourselves. You can't tell stories about people like us. I'm not so sure about that. Did you know that the bumblebee is unable to fly? It shouldn't be able to fly with its tiny wings.
What convinced the judge was a statement from a witness. Someone who saw Spencer Hastings in the DiLaurentis backyard with a girl, a blonde dressed in Alison's clothes, the night that Bethany was buried in that yard. Who was the witness? Jessica DiLaurentis. Mrs. DiLaurentis saw Spencer in the backyard and told the police? Where's the statement been for two years?

Francis? Where did it make landfall? - It didn't. - What? The hurricane turned. It's due east now. It might hit Bermuda.
-How are you talking to me? I am talking as I want! -And you called me stupid! Because you are stupid! Are you satisfied? I lost my job because of you. You did not lose it. You know where it is.
The idea of losing somebody you care about... No, Michelle is not going anywhere. Maybe not. But Devon is. So this office printer wasn't on the same network as the other printers? No, it was. Then why didn't it burn?
There are other ways. - Whose ways? SHIELD? - No. Their way is what got us here. - You started this war. This war started decades ago, when SHIELD was founded to guard the world against people like us.
I can't imagine there being much danger at the dairy hub. I'm only going to hunt a truck. Whoever drove that truck is a man that needs questioning. Good night. And how do you plan to find it? I held on to the vita-ray detector from project rebirth.
You took everything! I'm gonna kill you! Take your shot. Come on! Come on! This city doesn't deserve a better tomorrow. It deserves to drown... in its filth!
None of your people have died yet. The last one came within 50 meters of a school. Your troops have killed over a dozen Palestinians in house raids. - You expect us not to fight back? - We need the violence to stop. If it continues, the peacekeeping mission will fall apart.
How should I know? What's this got to do with anything in my juris-- You talk so much and say so little. I found the truck. It has an eagle-shaped hood ornament. I spoke to a rest stop waitress who had seen it.

They named the guitar as a murder weapon? Turn around. Fine. I hate this. Now, even if you wanted to kill someone with a guitar, you would naturally grab it by the neck, not the body. But let's just assume that it was used that way.
I'm not spending the rest of the night emailing invitations to an unveiling. You're going home? Well, then I'll send them out myself. Because tomorrow... This is happening. 4:00 p.m. sharp. I have a meeting at 4:00.
The release of body form... I think we should say lowell killed himself. The real killer is a zombie. Anyone on blaine's trail will be in danger And we can't warn them. And if they do manage to catch him, Then there's the whole zombie-in-a-prison problem. And then there's the body.
And Cho... Thanks. No problem. This is the ring we sent you a picture of. It was my grandmother's. Anne's dad gave it to me to propose with.
Lucas's murder didn't buy you any goodwill? Where does this leave us? I guess that depends on whether you still believe we want the same thing. The machine they're building. What is it? You want goodwill, let's start there.
So you don't think I'm crazy? You were... distraught, rightfully, and your brain scans showed abnormalities. Whether that was the radiation, I don't know. But your behavior was erratic, Molly. You can't deny it. Oh, I'll show you erratic, you keep lying. We had the boy's body in the morgue.
- And? Alper? - Yes? I saw Kurd's ghost. You saw Kurd's ghost? It was in front of my cabin.
Alper? - Yes? I saw Kurd's ghost. You saw Kurd's ghost? It was in front of my cabin. I went out and it disappeared.
Do you remember it? With all that expensive stained glass? Because I remember a day in that chapel. Damn you, Henry! Damn you! Father told me that that chapel wasn't built only for you, but also for me.
Can you tell me where Jim O'Donnell's office is? That depends. What do you know about immigration law? What, are we talking visas, or are you trying to process a labor certification? You know about immigration law? Doesn't everybody? Okay, tough guy, what do you think about my strategy on this?
- The Duke of Guise, your uncle, is - a dangerously ambitious man. - I read your letter. I wrote that letter thinking I'd never see you again. None of us are responsible for our hearts... only our actions. I do read Henry's bible.
Why? - Nothing. The meat's well cooked. That's nice, but it's not true. I'm having problems with the oven. It doesn't heat well.
Your eyes kind of drifted. What were you thinking about? A dream. What dream? I've had it here and there for about six months. I'm walking in the woods, carrying a body.
Come on down. Come here. You have to remind yourself. It's the disease. Remember what the dementia does? It gives you delusions.
No! No! Get away! - My son! - It's empty. - My son! - It's empty! The stroller is empty!
They're gonna blow up the bridge! There's a bomb! Blow it up! Blow it up! Blow it up! Blow it up! Blow it up! Blow it up!
She wouldn't be the first person to do so for political gain. And as the ruler of a Protestant country allied with England, she would no longer be a threat to Elizabeth. Do you honestly believe that I would give up my kingdom, my wife? Surrender now and Mary will live. Your plan relies on the cooperation of a fickle English queen who does not take kindly to the advice of others.
Hey, slow down! Wait... Get the hell away from me! Get away from me! Get away! No! - Please tell me you have the camera. - What's wrong?
I believe I was mistaken. The Machine is here. It's here because it's everywhere. What do you mean, Harry? Two years ago, when the Machine moved itself, it didn't go to a data farm. It went into the wires.
We good? Yes. Yes, I think we are. Welcome to the family. How'd you like that drink? I liked it.
We have our own destiny, Ophelia. No matter what we tell ourselves. But you're not the heir to the throne anymore. What happened on that phone call? What changed everything? This pendant. It's not mine.
I doubt that. Liz, I know a lot more about reddington than you think. The bullet nicked the right lung. I was able to re-inflate it with a chest tube, And will start him on a prophylactic antibiotic. What about the bullet? That's the problem.
Liz, I know a lot more about reddington than you think. The bullet nicked the right lung. I was able to re-inflate it with a chest tube, And will start him on a prophylactic antibiotic. What about the bullet? That's the problem. It has a percussion cap, Which causes it to essentially explode.
When someone twists a knife in your gut, I feel like I want to twist one right back. Mr. Zane, you scheduled this hearing. We've been waiting ten minutes. I'm not waiting any longer. Uh, you don't have to, your honor. My motion is here.
DAMMIT! This is pointless! Just let me go in and talk! They've executed my men. Where are the Zygons? We need to bomb the hell out of this place.
- No. And we ran her prints, but they're not on file. We've got our teams out there searching the woods, but we found these tucked into her bra. $50 bill, key card, and a cash receipt. From a coffee shop in the city, dated yesterday. This card looks like a hotel key.
You remember now, though, don't you? Tell me, Doctor, who is... the Hybrid? Who threatens all of time and space? Oh, that's easy. That's very, very easy. The Hybrid... is you. 'I'm human, with a little bit of Mire inside me.' 'The Hybrid is supposed to be half Time Lord, half Dalek.'
'Cause of you? That's where you were. You were trying to get me kicked out. You once said nobody knows anybody, right? So maybe you're the reason why we're here, and maybe everyone will learn about the real Simon Asher once and for all now that I know they should, too, right? Eh, mahal? The new agent review board investigates any and every breach of the Nat code of conduct.
I was too afraid that if I took it off, I would lose her for good. Well, technically, you didn't lie. You withheld. And withholding can compromise any one of you as an agent. Any secret, no matter how small, can be used as a weapon by someone who wants something from you. This scar isn't a secret. It's a reminder of who I used to be.
With me in custody, no one's looking for them. The FBI's always on alert. What, the standard "if you see something, say something"? That's not gonna cut it here, Liam. Whatever the FBI is doing, it's not enough. The real bomber is inside the Bureau.
But how does the dust become those creatures? You saw what happened. The dust conglomerates. It moulds itself into a humanoid form. It's adaptable. It's clever.
Be careful, Emma. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Calm down, Swan. I'm not proposing. You know I'm a survivor. This ring is why. I've had it for many years.
Fishlegs, that was just about the craziest and bravest, but mostly craziest, thing I have ever seen anyone do. You were right, Hiccup. Fighting dirty isn't me. - That was me. - It sure was. The Quaken was just being defensive. It was scared and all by itself.
You secure the Stinger so I can set the splint with the broken pieces of Dragonfly One. And be careful! We all remember what these guys' stings can do to you. You don't have to remind me. I know exactly what they can do. This plan is insane. You know that, right?
My best friend used to live here. She had good style, and I'm sure that a couple of her dresses are in a closet somewhere. I'm curious. What do you think of this color? It's great, actually, super vivid. It'll totally make your eyes pop.
I want him dead, Damon. No one's gonna stop me from killing him... Not in 6 months, not in 6 weeks... Now. Twins are the lifeblood of the Gemini coven. If a pregnant mother is in danger, then the transfer is our magical failsafe.
Enjoy Christmas. In the new year, you will return to your captain, and he will welcome you with open arms, and, detective, you will remember today as your darkest day. Tomorrow will be better, the day after better still. You will go on. Give me the bad news, doc. Aya's stake was cursed.
And you will never hold me back from getting what I want again. Hook... Killian... Whatever deal you made to get your revenge on Gold, it's not worth it. The darkness is using you. It doesn't care what you want.
Well, the paper is Dutch hemp, and its degradation dates it to the late 1700s. So Crane found old paper, but the ink is fake. No, the ink is iron gall from iron salts and tannic acids. Which was the standard in Europe from the fifth to the 19th century. But the signature is fake? No.
- What is your name, son? - Yavuz. Damn it, it's Yavuz! Yavuz, you look like a tough young man. You're scared, but you look tough. The human soul is corrupt. It only worships power.
- Yavuz. Damn it, it's Yavuz! Yavuz, you look like a tough young man. You're scared, but you look tough. The human soul is corrupt. It only worships power. It keeps searching for new things to worship.
Boog, your butt saved ours! Hey, what'd I miss? Now it's personal. How did a werewolf get a pilot's license? It's got the intelligence of a man. Yeah, but you'd think when it applied for a license... somebody would have said something.
Before lawyers came along, the word "divorce" didn't even exist in the English language. They invented the concept the same way Hallmark invented Mother's Day. Hallmark invented Mother's Day? Not even. You are a schmuck. Hold my drink. - Hey. I wanted to return your cassette.
Or use a less dense type to make it lighter. No good. It's gym clothes. Gym clothes are evolving too. You really are stubborn. If you want beauty, printed rayon bare jersey will have bright and beautiful colors.
She is a goddess! Holy crap. I just did that. Take this away. The Darkness is coming. It's so peaceful.
April can be... No, look, I know. She's The Machine. She's the... What? Oh, that's what we call her over there... "The Machine."
The dealer doesn't care, Kripke has no authority over us, and you being related to a metal container would explain a lot. Help me hook this up. Uh-oh. What? Well, did you see this sticker? What is it?
What the hell, Lilywhite? It's 7:45 p.m. Are you 90? Rough day is all. I'm going to remind you of something, son, something you already know. The world ain't all Dilly Bars and debutante balls. The world throws wicked punches.
And you are in my robe. I stopped walking around naked about 20 years ago. And started cross-dressing? Work? Yeah. A body was found on parklands in western Virginia.
It will be your undoing, Mulder. I like the intimate scenes between Mulder and Scully that bring us closer together, adding to the history of the series. Listen to me -- as your friend and as a physician, you are on dangerous ground here. I know what I'm doing. You could possibly make 12 different shows out of this show. It's a very flexible frame in terms of tonality, in terms of action, in terms of mythology, in terms of subject matter.
It's all I can give you. God be with you and watch over you. Thank you. This bird is no good. I tell you, no good! The priest won't accept it.
You were right. She wasn't who I thought she was. She was complicated. Complicated? The dark dimension is volatile. Dangerous.
"'We're safe! ' said Paul, as they ran from the dragon." Um, who's Paul? Sorry, "the Prince." "Then, he leaned in to kiss her, and finally said..." Oh, that's rich. How does the story end?
You look glorious, Lord. I know. Father... I noticed the tower. Impressive. I built it for you.
A sea captain is no job for a lady. Time is against you, and you're being careless with it. I once believed I could do as many as six impossible things... before breakfast. That is a child's dream, Alice. The Wonder is just a ship. It's not just a ship.
But Father Miller's understanding of Christ's soon return cannot be ignored. We must follow the Word of God over the rule of men. We will not keep this good news quiet. And if that means we must leave... ..then leave we shall. My family feels an unspeakable joy at the hope of Christ's return. We feel love, the love of Jesus. It...it lifts us up, it carries us forward.
I'm gonna say, it probably doesn't help that you're dressed like you grocery-shop at a CVS. What? I love this sweater. I don't know why you would. This sweater goes with everything. It's a neutral.
Copy that. All right, where are we going? Where are we going? This is the one. Right here. What's the number? 4-5-5-2-3-4-5-B. That number does not exist.
Get more officers in there now. Command one to dispatch. Suspects in sight. Damn it! Delta, check the stairs to the north. There's a small gray door down here.
Negative entities often feed off emotional distress. They like to kick you when you're down. That hardly seems fair. No, it really isn't. Do you know when the voice is gonna speak? Sometimes.
Was that the Demiguise? NEWT: But I think it might be the reason that the Demiguise is here. (CHUCKLES) Its sight operates on probability, so it can foresee the most likely immediate future. TINA:
So, chances of beating Te Kā? Bupkis. We're never making it to Te Fiti. This mission is cursed. It's not cursed. Shark head.
Is that a misprint right there? It's gotta be, right? - The Zafiro Añejo? - Yeah. - That's correct, believe it or not. - Holy shit, a $50 shot of tequila?
Running a great house in Paris had proved more complicated than I'd ever imagined. Fortunately, Jared had selected his servants with care, so we had no worries regarding their trustworthiness. Even after several weeks, Paris itself remained an endless source of fascination. As I gazed upon the quaint city streets, I found it hard to believe that in a mere 40 years, the French Revolution would turn them into rivers of blood. The last time I had been here was during the delirious celebration marking the end of the Second World War. I had hoped to climb to the top of the Eiffel Tower, but the Nazis had closed it during the occupation, and it had yet to reopen.
- Thank you, Mr Aslan! - Don't mention it. You can have it. It's a cursed hat. - Cursed? - Yes. On the contrary, this hat brings good luck.
You can have it. It's a cursed hat. - Cursed? - Yes. On the contrary, this hat brings good luck. It's saved several lives.
- This way. - Good evening, Mr Mercier. - Good evening, Mr President. Have a seat. - There's a reward. - I don't want it. Since you don't want the reward, let me tell you a secret. I lost this hat in Lyons.
- Good. The cut-off date is the 25th? - Right. Let's take a round and start with Legal. - Yes, we've... - We have a new supplier contract. Let's pass it around.
Mad? Never. He was my first cousin, but I practically raised that boy. I loved him. So when you got here was the door locked? There is a code on the VIP entrance. It keeps the paparazzi away.
Created according to our image. A race of workers and those, who keep. Any hope of peace has long been forgotten, lost time. I see two Noides, fleeing Subterra-3. - Confirmation of the application. - Confirmation!
The municipal elections are in six weeks so you're striking a pose. Deputy Mayor, we all know why you're supporting the regeneration of the port. Because I'm on the Port Committee. Marseille has to move with the times. There's a gulf between your generation and today's generation. You should no longer have a say. This is a city that has to modernize.
Mine's dead too. We will ask them to provide us with local phones. You know but, my apps can become very useful. Such as? My diary. April 14th... Arrivals hall, immigration line. The line is... lethargic.
I made a video. Not exactly evidence. You used it to exonerate a client. You used falsified evidence to exonerate a client. Mm, I think you're splitting hairs. I'm not splitting hairs. What if Davis Main find out you faked evidence?
She knows you. She should have known better. - You are such an asshole. - Why? For pointing out her one mistake was believing in you? Chrissake, can we get some perspective here? It was a simple little commercial.
- You are such an asshole. - Why? For pointing out her one mistake was believing in you? Chrissake, can we get some perspective here? It was a simple little commercial. It aired once, that's all.
It's not alive. It's not dead. Nurse? Is it wise to administer a hypertonic saline to a cardiac arrest patient? Agent Scully, we had to confirm your mother's advance directive, and it indicates that she not be resuscitated if unconscious or requires artificial respiration. She amended it last year.
You were never going to fight fair. From the beginning. Why start a fight you can't win? Because Orus is dead... and father, destroyed. Because of you. Your body will settle in time.
The only way to know is to examine him myself. [Growling] Run. - What? - Run. He's telling us to run. Tropical Storm Hunter is moving up the southern coast of Thailand.
-Mike, what kind of danger? Danger danger. No, no, no! We're going back to plan A. We're telling your mom. Take a look at this beaut. Should've seen it when I got it.
So, my brother took off the leash, and in that instant, the dog spotted a cat. I imagine it must have looked just like that piece of felt. He ran. Never saw a thing as beautiful as that old dog... running. Until, at last, he finally caught it. And to the horror of everyone, he killed that little cat.
Stupid. What do you guys call it? Us guys? Don't give me shit, Koen. Your people. The Namorrodor.
You got upstairs. I did. What's it like up there? The sun was out. You gotta get my ring. I stashed it up there when he brought me in.
You know, I gotta give you credit. You rock that jewelry real well. You know, that's how we met. I'm a jewelry designer. - Oh. - And Butch, that boy loved his bling. Oh, yeah? Did you make Dr. Ronald's tongue ring, too?
Last season on Penny Dreadful... Do you believe the past can return? It never leaves us.
There's a blockade outside of camp, food rationing inside, jail full of Grounders. There's a lot for people to be upset about right now. This... this is... this is all the more reason to stand behind your chancellor. I got to go. Here. So the bug's in place?
- Really? But you have to be very quiet or you'll scare them off. I know that. - Shall we go? - Yes! Have you ever seen a fairy?
Do you bleed? -No. -Good. Your female instinct, what does it tell you? I don't have one. Of course you do.
That math was known. That took Shepard, took Grissom. That cannot take Glenn. Now, the Atlas rocket... that can push us into orbit. Goes up, delivers the capsule into an elliptical orbit. Earth's gravity keeps pulling at it but it's going so fast, it keeps missing the Earth.
But there aren't any eye slits. How am I supposed to see? Well, therein lies the beauty. Two-way mirrors, just like the cops use, huh? I don't know, I don't know. That chemical plant...
Rise up. Rise up! Go into those dark streets you know so well, those foul alleys and secret back lanes and find me a bad man! A faithless husband. A cruel lover. A rich despot. A scrofulous john fucking some girl just like you, and quick with the back of his hand while he's at it. Find him and bring me his right hand! Yes!
Rise up! Go into those dark streets you know so well, those foul alleys and secret back lanes and find me a bad man! A faithless husband. A cruel lover. A rich despot. A scrofulous john fucking some girl just like you, and quick with the back of his hand while he's at it. Find him and bring me his right hand! Yes! Cut it off and hold it bleeding to your breast!
Imagine it this way... Each night, the teenage Chimera... The success. This teenager goes out into the night and transforms. Whether it's a young man or young woman, they become a werewolf. A very large, very powerful werewolf the people of Gevaudan called The Beast. Every night it transforms, it remembers a little more of who it used to be.
Yeah. I can go check the crime scene for any leftover evidence. You should go to Starling General and have that looked at. I'll be fine. Because eating a cheeseburger is a better option? This isn't for me.
Their work has always been about making this world a better place. And today, we get to take another step towards that goal. As you know, battery technology has been at a virtual standstill for decades, with batteries lasting, nor charging any faster than they did in the 1970s. Until now. Today Palmer Tech is pleased to introduce the Power Cell, a 100% recyclable battery. It can charge an electric car for thousands of miles.
Sara's lifetime? You channeled your grief and became the Black Canary, but Sara's not dead anymore. Maybe you owe it to yourself to pursue the path you were on. You're serious? This city has enough heroes with masks on. With Ruvé Darhk as mayor, it needs a hero without a mask.
Switching you to their feed now. Turn it off. Those missiles hit, and he's going to become even stronger, isn't he? He already is with the souls of all of those Argus agents that he just killed. Wait. I'm in. I'm through Cooper's firewalls.
Then he and his followers can rebuild. Truth be told, it's not dissimilar to the plan I had for the glades once upon a time, but on a much, much larger scale. Let me guess... You don't think that destroying the entire world is completely insane? The world is what's insane. It is beyond saving.
She was wrong. She wasn't wrong. Your feelings may not have changed, but mine have. I've been lying to myself, trying to hold on. But the part of me that loved you, the part of me that hoped for your redemption... That part was human.
A rare African American Sling Lizard. Just gonna wait for someone to show up order a pizza. Fred—are you excited about the preview tomorrow? I wish I had another week to edit. I think I could make it perfect. Stop it.
No, you have to. - Cathy will negotiate on my behalf. - I don't trust her on this. That's a risk we'll have to take. The risk I won't take is being overseas if the president dies. We don't even know if Congress will approve the appropriation for the bailout.
- The Yakuza were guarding something. - Yeah, but... You're not gonna believe this. Holy shit. Why are the Yakuza digging a hole? Give me the flashlight.
Some more than others, but none of us alone. Some bloody their fists trying to keep the Kitchen safe. Others bloody the streets in the hope they can stop the tide, the crime, the cruelty... the disregard for human life all around them. But this is Hell's Kitchen. Angel or devil, rich or poor, young or old, you live here. You didn't choose this town.
Cheers to that. Good God. Cheers. - This have a lid? - There isn't one. The Niffin becomes fused with the wood.
-You herd that? -[both laughing] Friendship, that's all that matters. [Maria] No friend left behind. That was the answer. If only I had known that in the past. I love my new Maria Bamford Pepper Stepper Pepper-bot.
There it is. We stop here. All right. This is where we split up. The entrance to the tunnel is right over there. Yeah.
I look as old as her dad. - You robbed me of her. - Griffin. Stop talking. So I can concentrate. Wake up, man. This city is screwed up because of you.
It's a question many of you have asked yourselves as November approaches. Right now, as I sit in this chair, in this office, where so many of my predecessors have steered our nation through turbulent times... I realize that this job is one that transcends politics and rhetoric. Entrusted to anyone who sits behind this desk is something far more elemental, the very survival of our nation. And I, as your president, must confront the storm before us. That storm is terror. More dangerous and unpredictable than any hurricane.

And I, as your president, must confront the storm before us. That storm is terror. More dangerous and unpredictable than any hurricane. It has endangered us abroad.
So I let him go. I abandoned him. I let my brother drown so I could save myself. So that's why you're hallucinating him? Because some faux version of your brother is upset with something that you did in a fake reality? The hellstone is trying to tell me something.
So come with us. Oh, my God, you're insane. You actually think that you can beat her. Hey, Marina's strong, but so are we. Nothing like that at school, huh? Protection charm.
Let me know if you need anything else. - Your dress is stunning. - Thank you. I feel more nervous wearing that dress than I ever have on the battlefield. I think that's pretty normal. Lydia, I need to talk to you about something. What is it? Valentine sent a Shax demon to track us on our mission today.
The gemstone that I gave you... pop it right in there. That was a gemstone? Well, it's more than a gemstone... it's also like a kind of onboard computer. Come here. Can you see... Can you see that little yellow star at the end of that curve?
Yeah, well, destiny's about to kick our ass. Shall we dance? - We still got it. Mi amor... There was a tunnel under the barn. We never figured out where it led to.
The Author's power is far greater than that bearded old man wanted you to believe. I destroyed the quill. Oh, yes, yes, I know what you did. We hear it all down here. But I'm guessing you don't know much about the quill, do you? The sorcerer bequeathed the quill to all of you, but it is not a simple pen. It is a magical energy. It is a living, breathing entity.
We hear it all down here. But I'm guessing you don't know much about the quill, do you? The sorcerer bequeathed the quill to all of you, but it is not a simple pen. It is a magical energy. It is a living, breathing entity. It's alive? Oh, yes. And when you broke it, Henry, you sent it right down here to the Underworld, its purpose unfulfilled.
She really was born for this. It's the WMD team. The bomb is gone. Response team confirms... It's gone. The terrorist took it.
I am The Flash. Previously on "The Flash"... Barry, what you're seeing is the Speed Force... Your past, your present, your future. Say, Iris, you look amazing. Thanks, Tony. His skin changed.
So I drove here, right? I'm sitting at the entrance to the garage when I realize I don't have my key card. I gotta drive all the way home to get it. When I got there, I couldn't find it anywhere. Suddenly, I remember: I put it in the glove compartment.
All I care about is that book, and you're going to tell me where it is, right now! You're worse than my husband! I can do this all day, sugar lips. It's him. Welcome to my cabin in the woods. It is.
CAT: Do you think you can do it? We can't stop Myriad's signal, but we can piggyback off of it. We're lucky. This TV station is old. Not that old. Not old-old.
- You're back. - Batman. Brainiac has already won, we've been bottled. But, how did you get here? Time sphere. The Legion has only one that wasn't destroyed when Brainiac took over.
Do you love her? Yes, I--I do. There's the moment when you realize you love a woman, and the moment you realize you're gonna marry her. I want to hear about the second one. It was the end of last year. I'd gotten in late from a case.
4th of July fireworks in Phoenix. 4th of July in 1961. It's not possible. But it is. You're holding it. Tell me about the film you saw.
I would've never let Kip enlist. I would've stopped him. But I couldn't. I was asleep. You didn't think the war was right? I never really thought about it being right or wrong.
Is she okay? If you say you need him, you must need him. I'll have RT stop by. Son, y'all know y'all can't jump. I tracked the last package to the Midtown post office it was mailed from. However, there's no evidence on the security footage of anyone mailing it from inside the station.
Move! - Watch it on the right. - Jesus! Watch it. No, no, no! This road is not closed.
The cotton anniversary. Okay, I got it. Here it is. Look at the, uh, date on the back. - Oh! And Lorelai... - Huh? The virus protection software I told you about. Want me to pop it on your computer?
- Screw you! - Eat me! Nice to see you, Francie. I miss Doyle. Calm down. I miss the sex.
She was in Kinky Boots! Nobody is named Kinky Boots! -This is not right. -No. I saw the show twice. The Stars Hollow Gazette cannot just go down. I mean, it's not Spotlight at the Boston Globe.
It's very sad. But it was getting less sadder because we were getting better, but we got strangled by the red tape. - You know? - Yes. The fucking red tape. Money, money, always money. I know. Beppi wants me to come back, to go on tour, to do this concert, to be La Fiamma again, because of the money. How is the pasta?
_ JEN: I'm telling you, there's a rat in the attic. I can hear it.
Please, no. You guys go ahead. Rizzoli. ‭Isles. Yeah, I got it. ‭Okay. We'll be right there. What about your surgery?
I was worried about you. I know. I'm not saying that because you said something nice about me. Really, like, you... are you sure that you're okay? You know, the surgery went well. I feel pretty good.
- He's no longer with us. - Do you know where we can find him? - I'm sorry. I mean, he died. Uh, like I said, he was a senior board member. Does anybody else know the story? I hope not.
How is that possible? - Hey. - Hey. Oh, so did you go with the dark roast? Mm-hmm. It's great with the hazelnut cream. I really love that.
Then I suggest you get started. Aye-aye, captain. I am on it. Angie, found the murder weapon. It's a high-end ice Axe. Yikes.
Oh, good, it's here. The files from France? Aubrey asked me to look into Chadwick Grey, the guy from the Gem Society who put the microscopic code on the diamonds. And? And... before he worked at the Gem Soc, he sold jewelry in Paris at the first shop robbed by the Marquise. We looked into Mr. Grey. You used to work selling jewelry, and the last place you worked was robbed by thieves going after historical knock-off jewels. That robbery is what made me want to help secure such items.
Habib. Hi, Patrick. Chef, a word, please. It's cool, it's cool. My product... I need it back. Don't worry about it.
- And neither can this. - Fascinating. Which is why you'll keep what I'm about to tell you a secret. Even from the rest of your team. The ATOM suit is made of and powered by dwarf star alloy. It's strong enough to withstand bullets, arrows, and explosives.
We need to stop it, or there could be major casualties. I've got it. I've almost got it. I've got him. That pod... It's identical to mine.
He's brave, in his own unique... way. I like that he's there for you. I like that he's doing this even though he doesn't have to. Call him again. He's not much of a phone-answerer, in my experience. Once we plug in the machine, everything will become clear, I'm sure of it. You don't even know what it does.
Call him again. He's not much of a phone-answerer, in my experience. Once we plug in the machine, everything will become clear, I'm sure of it. You don't even know what it does. Well, I mean, clearly, it... clarifies everything? Show me.
The machine came to us from across time and space. You were there, you're one of the original souls. Why is it, do you think, that Rainey didn't let us build another altar? Had us holed up in some rotted-out mansion basement, had us in some decrepit zoo building? It's so he could control it. The altar is sacred--
Inspector Delarue? Who asked you to investigate Touvier? The prosecutor to the Court of Security. What for? I'd like to see your report. It's confidential.
He's coming. He's coming. - Hi! - Hi. I love your movie. Well, thanks.
When I'm sheriff, the first thing I do is take down that stupid painting in your office. - She's got you there. - I know. - Dad? - I love this town. I absolutely love it.
Yes. What's so scary about local guardians? Are you leaving now? Why would I stay? Here is a letter. I found it among Miss Bai's things. Sorry,
You came and begged me for help with a case of demonic possession, and now you got your knickers in a twist 'cause I didn't bring you flowers? I don't actually know you. No. I don't know you. There are stages to a demonic possession, my friend. Right now, my guess... the demon's gone possum. Gathering its strength, waiting to show its ratty little teeth.
Yes! Electrifying! James comes from a world where he wants his phone and his camera separate. "I like a paper diary." This Mazda is a smartphone. It does everything.
That's freedom. That's brainwashing. What do you think was in that injector? My free will. I don't think so. That medicine wasn't meant for you.
That's brainwashing. What do you think was in that injector? My free will. I don't think so. That medicine wasn't meant for you. It's messing with your mind.
-It's okay. Everything is fine. Trust me. Trust me. It's okay. Cássia, I'm already fixing the alarm.
It was a burner. - Untraceable. - He's playing with us. He called me to brag while we watched her burn. Scorsese, were you able to recover anything else from the victim? I found the SD card from Hannah's bag.
They have to obey you. If only it were that easy. It doesn't have to be so difficult. Commodus, the people of Rome, they're just like you. They want to see an end to this war. I've heard it in the streets every day.
Traffic alert. Douche on the loose. With four contenders duking it out for top spot, here's a fifth to add to the mix. This time, the focus is on me. This invention has taken the world by storm in just the last couple of years. You'll see it at any tourist landmark.
[Carr] And forced me to lie down. He just slapped me across the face and I thought, "Okay, I'll just have to go through with this." [whistling stops] Going within someone else's body, I mean... uninvited, you know, [stammers] it's just huge. And I survived 'cause I took my mind away. I thought, "You can never, ever harm my essence, my spirit. My body is only part of me.
This place is amazing! It was built on the site of the very first sector of the wall that was pulled down. The tooth, huh? All those people down there believed the wall was dividing the world. That East and West were separating people into "us" or "them." But the real division, the only one that has ever mattered, was never horizontal.
Fel! In Azeroth? In the barracks. One the bodies. Guardian, what is the Fel? A magic unlike any other.
In Azeroth? In the barracks. One the bodies. Guardian, what is the Fel? A magic unlike any other. It feeds on life itself.
In the barracks. One the bodies. Guardian, what is the Fel? A magic unlike any other. It feeds on life itself. It pollutes the user, twisting everything it touches.
JOHN CLAYTON II: My family. I have done all I can to protect them. We have been surrounded by predators since the shipwreck. (INFANT CRYING) The jungle consumes everything.
Special Agent Hamer, FBI. Jesus Garcia. Queens. (DOG WHINES) Are you adopting a puppy, Mr. Harding? Yes, yeah.
But it's like the malignancy of any secret, it just kept getting worse. Every time I go over it, what I did, the choices I made... I swear, I couldn't have done anything else. But that's not the point. I dealt with the problem. I just had no idea what the solution would do to me.
- Wait. he signed up to donate his organs. One of which is a liver. Which is a perfect match for Terence. Exactly. His liver will never go to the national list.
That's not gonna happen. Why are you so confident? It isn't confidence. Doubt leads to death. Tell me the legend again. Why are you so interested in hearing it?
And finally... I am almost exhausted in the telling of it. Finally, in the year of our Lord 1802, he took himself off to Africa. Well, now he is returned. And Delaney's will leaves him everything. Including Nootka. Do we have a copy of the Nootka Sound treaty yet? Where perhaps our lawyers could pick it apart?
Fuck, yes. You're my bodyguard? That means you guard my body. Is that not right? Not when you're robbing a bank. At the moment, my body is going to the bank.
Yes, I'm serious. You think I'm any different than any other politician? I used to. Izzy, you been around long enough. You know what it is. I don't make the rules. The Brooks Innovation deal is changing the course of history in this city.
And the day after that and the day after that, leaving you with an eternity to contemplate your regrets. And to think all of this came out of your boring little Boy Scout brain. Actually, I have to say, I'm... I'm quite jealous. So all this is just a bunch of bullshit? Including the key? No, the key was real.
Leave a message! God damn it, Christopher. I told you to change that. Listen, I was right. You were wrong. Remember my bigfoot?
Thanks. So I've been calling around about all of the hunters that died. Um, every one of them had years of experience. We got a letter from Eileen. Eileen? She sent it four days ago.
Dad, please, I don't want to leave. It'll be fine, honey. Okay... - Wow. - Alex? Signal's gone. Well, let's go back inside.
- Don't be sorry. There's no reason to be sorry. Listen, I took one of the vibrators home and... Ah-ha! I think I know who took one of the vibrators. And love it. There's no other way to say it.
Not based on the physical evidence I have. Okay, thank you. However... I found an extraordinarily high level of hyaluronidase in her system. - What's that? - Something found in bug saliva. I had to look it up, having never seen it before.
Klaus did say that Marcel would be occupied. We can enter his home, steal whatever we need, - and leave before anyone notices. - Okay. You want me to help you rob the most deadly vampire on the planet? I will pass. If you're worried about a fight... allow me to even the odds. The stone is kyanite.
It went completely soft! I don't know how to do it! I'll teach you, Dilaver. Now, stand up. Take off your clothes slowly. Don't be scared, Dilaver.
That is 60 more than you get from a BMW M3. 60! It's 175 more than you get from that Jag that James would be droning on about now, had I not stepped in and saved the day. And then there's the way it revs. Most turbocharged engines are a bit wheezy at the top end, but because the twin-scroll turbo in this is mounted in the V of the engine... just like it is in a Ferrari California, coincidentally, the rev counter is still a blur This engine is... it's a masterpiece. An absolute gem.

Well, I thought you said all this was beautiful. Oh, it is. So is a volcanic eruption or a tsunami. Few things are more beautiful than destruction, but doesn't mean I enjoy it. So this mist, you hope it'll disappear again? Yes, of course.
He said he would hurt me again and again until I gave in to God's will. Nathalie, where is Link? All right, it's okay. You don't have to tell me, but... The mist came. It saved me.
Oh, baby. We found Regina Franklin's parents in Tampa. I offered to fly down and talk to them personally, But apparently her mother has a cousin who lives here, So... we flew them up instead. Some cases end well and you can... forget about them. But some some become a part of who you are. This job is going to change you.
I need to find a guy. Uh, can you help me out? Okay, yeah, one second. Yeah? The body adapts. It protects itself.
Doctor! Look, a stone cairn - Pictish civilisation. The bird! What about it? It said "dark". Yes, well that's why we're hurrying, because there's not much light at this time of day.
